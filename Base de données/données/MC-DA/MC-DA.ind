aids: to settle a discrimination lawsuit
campbell university agreed to pay $
to a physical education instructor fired in
after the university learned he had aids. officials from the north carolina university said the instructor
known as john doe
posed a direct threat to students and himself. the equal employment opportunities commission (eeoc) sued in april
on doe's behalf
saying the university violated the americans with disabilities act (ada). doe's attorney also charged the university with violating the rehabilitation act and the employee retirement income security
the university decided to settle after learning that medical experts were prepared to testify that doe could perform his job without endangering anyone. as part of the settlement
doe will return to the payroll
but at a new job which he developed. in addition
the university agreed to keep confidential the medical information of its employees
purge doe's personnel file of any references to his medical condition or the discrimination complaint
and provide aids awareness and sensitivity training to university managers and supervisors. oabl
