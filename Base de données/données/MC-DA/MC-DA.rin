	aids: to settle a discrimination lawsuit
	campbell university agreed to pay $
	to a physical education instructor fired in
	after the university learned he had aids. officials from the north carolina university said the instructor
	known as john doe
	posed a direct threat to students and himself. the equal employment opportunities commission (eeoc) sued in april
	on doe's behalf
	saying the university violated the americans with disabilities act (ada). doe's attorney also charged the university with violating the rehabilitation act and the employee retirement income security
	the university decided to settle after learning that medical experts were prepared to testify that doe could perform his job without endangering anyone. as part of the settlement
	doe will return to the payroll
	but at a new job which he developed. in addition
	the university agreed to keep confidential the medical information of its employees
	purge doe's personnel file of any references to his medical condition or the discrimination complaint
	and provide aids awareness and sensitivity training to university managers and supervisors. oabl
