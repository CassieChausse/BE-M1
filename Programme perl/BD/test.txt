AB - Objectives: This study investigated how one subculture's norms, traditions, ideals, and imperatives influenced the attitudes, beliefs, emotions, and behaviours of a young athlete (Joe) as he moved from resistance to acculturation. Design: Longitudinal case study of one athlete in one specific sport subculture. Method: Joe took part in five open-ended in-depth interviews over a 14-month period to investigate his experiences as an elite athlete within an Australian football team. Joe's story was analysed through an acculturation-process lens and models on mental toughness, overtraining, and stress-recovery to evaluate the indoctrination of one athlete. Findings: During the initial interviews Joe resisted the subculture demands of the football club and tried to find success by maintaining his own beliefs. By the end of the 14-month study Joe had realised that to be successful in the club he needed to embrace the norms, traditions, ideals, and imperatives of the football culture. Joe gained acceptance at the club when he eventually internalised the hypermasculine subculture and ignored injury, played in pain, subjugated his interests for football, and viewed physical abuse as a positive and necessary part of the toughening process. Conclusion: Joe's case study demonstrates that the subcultural ideals of mental toughness mean ignoring injury, playing in pain, denying emotion and vulnerability, and sacrificing individuality, which inevitably lead to stress/recovery imbalance and overtraining. In this subculture, demonstrating mental toughness is similar to a hypermasculine environment typified by slogans such as no-pain-no-gain and rest-is-for-the-dead where success is more important than individual wellbeing.

AB - We investigated whether a shared mental model is present in elite ice hockey and handball teams. In total, 231 male players participated in the study. Shared mental models were found to exist. Relationships between shared mental models and coaching efforts to develop a general training shared mental model and an opponent-specific model were explored. The relationship between role clarity and shared mental model, general training shared mental model, and opponent-specific model was positive. The shared mental model is a useful construct for analyzing elite team practice and coaching behavior. Coaches and sport psychologists should be aware that establishing a shared mental model in elite teams is essential in facilitating performance.

AB - Mental toughness is considered by many in the popular media and in sports psychology to be an important construct underlying success in learning and performance. However, despite a long conceptual history, little work has empirically examined the relationships between mental toughness and key learning and performance outcomes. Thus, the purpose of this laboratory study was to examine the incremental predictive validity of trait-based and domain mental toughness scores in the context of learning a complex computer task using a variety of cognitive, affective, and skill-based criteria, including a test of adaptive performance. Results revealed no relationships between trait-based mental toughness and any learning criteria. In contrast, scores from a multidimensional domain mental toughness scale explained variance in post-practice self-efficacy and performance beyond that explained by GMA, prior experience, baseline performance, pre-practice self-efficacy, goal orientation, and core self-evaluations, and was indirectly related to adaptive performance via post-practice self-efficacy and performance. Self-belief was the mental toughness subscale primarily responsible for the incremental validity. Results are discussed in terms of the implications for the conceptualization and predictive validity of mental toughness.

AB - Using the Integrated Model of Response to Sport Injury as a theoretical framework, athletes’ psychological strengths and emotional responses were explored throughout the injury process using a case study approach. Four Division I athletes completed measures of mental toughness, hardiness, and optimism before their season (time 1), once they became injured (time 2), midway through rehabilitation (time 3), and when they were cleared to participate (time 4). Coping behavior, psychological response, and rehabilitation adherence were recorded at time 2–time 4, while recovering. In addition, interviews were conducted after time 4. Mental toughness, hardiness, and optimism varied over time and across cases, with broad individual differences in response to injury. Athletes experienced a loss of athletic identity combined with feelings of guilt and helplessness over the initial stages of injury, but positive experiences were also found. All cases also reported playing through injury. Understanding the psychological strengths and responses of athletes can help professionals work with injured athletes.

AB - People differ in their implicit theories about mental toughness, that is, whether they believe this quality is immutable (entity theorists) or changeable (incremental theorists). The aim of this study was to explore whether peoples’ implicit theories of mental toughness are related to cognitive, motivational, and behavioral variables considered as hallmarks of this personal quality. We conducted 3 studies with participants from different achievement contexts: 444 undergraduate students aged 17 to 26 years (M = 19.25); 395 employees aged 25 to 79 years (M = 48.78); and 230 adolescent athletes aged 11 to 17 years (M = 14.98). Students completed a measure of implicit theories of mental toughness, fear of failure, and perceived stress. Employees completed a measure of implicit theories and were rated on performance and creativity by their supervisor. Athletes completed a measure of implicit theories of mental toughness, resilience, and thriving. Across all 3 samples, cluster analyses supported the existence of an incremental theory (high incremental theory, low entity theory) alongside an ambivalent group (moderate scores on both theories). These clusters differed on fear of failure, stress, performance, creativity, resilience, and thriving consistent with theoretical expectations. The current findings suggest that people’s implicit theories of mental toughness may have important implications for understanding cognitive, motivational, and behavioral correlates considered hallmarks of this psychological concept.

AB - College student-athletes face unique stressors that can contribute to compromised well-being. Additionally, there are a variety of barriers that prevent student-athletes from accessing mental health supports. This study used self-report questionnaires and qualitative interviews to examine the impact of an integrative outreach model that incorporated mental health education, sport psychology concepts, and mental skill techniques, on awareness and attitudes related to mental health and counseling. Findings indicate that this model may be effective in increasing awareness of mental health supports, reducing stigma, and development of performance enhancement and self-care skills.

AB - This comparative case study features six types of mentoring and coaching: mentors of young people; mentors of leaders; mentors of newly qualified teachers; executive coaches; coaching psychologists; sports coaches. Three practitioners from each of these disciplines were interviewed to identify if there were shared and distinctive approaches between mentoring and coaching. Participants shared how their approaches might be transferable to other types of mentoring and coaching. Findings suggest that practitioners should be supported to specialise in a specific mentoring or coaching discipline; adopt a mentor-coach interdisciplinary approach; or to develop multidisciplinary approaches. Further research is needed which takes into consideration additional types of mentoring and coaching. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - We argue that basic psychological needs theory (BPNT) offers impetus to the value of mental toughness as a mechanism for optimizing human functioning. We hypothesized that psychological needs satisfaction (thwarting) would be associated with higher (lower) levels of mental toughness, positive affect, and performance and lower (higher) levels of negative affect. We also expected that mental toughness would be associated with higher levels of positive affect and performance and lower levels of negative affect. Further, we predicted that coaching environments would be related to mental toughness indirectly through psychological needs and that psychological needs would indirectly relate with performance and affect through mental toughness. Adolescent cross-country runners (136 male and 85 female, M age = 14.36) completed questionnaires pertaining to BPNT variables, mental toughness, and affect. Race times were also collected. Our findings supported our hypotheses. We concluded that BPNT is generative in understanding some of the antecedents and consequences of mental toughness and is a novel framework useful for understanding mental toughness.

In December 2011, a concept plan was developed between the 307th Engineer Battalion and the Comprehensive Soldier and Family Fitness Program (CSF2). This 12-month plan utilized a periodization methodology that educated and applied mental skills within the Sapper-Athlete-Warrior Program. CSF2 tailored the delivery of training to meet the goals of the battalion and their route clearance mission. The applied intervention identified specific mental skills, training methodologies and lessons learned during implementation.

AB - It has been suggested that the ability of lucid dreaming is positively associated with both mental health and physical fitness, which in turn seem to also be interrelated. The present study of a sample of sport science students (N = 72) investigated the relationships between lucid dream frequency, mental well-being and physical self-concept. Marsh’s Physical Self-Description Questionnaire (PSDQ) was used to measure physical self-concept as an indicator of physical fitness and two measures of mental well-being were employed, the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS) and Ryff’s Scale of Psychological Well-Being (RPWB). Lucid dreaming was found to be negatively associated with physical self-concept. Although mental well-being was not related to lucid dream frequency, it was strongly associated with physical self-concept. Future research should explore the relationships in a less physically active sample, and could benefit from including external physical measures.

Participants of this study—927 athletes and 931 non-athletes—completed a battery of questionnaires designed to assess four characteristics of mental toughness: hope, optimism, perseverance and resilience. The higher-order structure of mental toughness was found to be the same for both athletes and non-athletes. The latent mean differences analyses showed that athletes scored higher in mental toughness when compared to non-athletes. Taken together, these findings support the theoretical assumption that mental toughness is a higher-order construct encompassing different characteristics and that sport participation is associated with higher mental toughness.

AB - This study reports the results of a content analysis of interviews with 28 Norwegian world‐class athletes and 28 controls, matched for gender, age, and type of sport. Semi‐structured interviews explored their perceptions of their best performance. The interviews were analyzed using the ATLAS.ti and yielded 20 higher‐order codes. Nine higher‐order codes were categorized as inner‐oriented, five were categorized as outer‐oriented, and six were a combination of inner‐ and outer‐oriented. Statistical analysis, using the Mann‐Whitney test, showed significant group differences for seven higher‐order codes: (a) two outer‐oriented codes relating to “mastery – achievements” and “training – outer”; and (b) five inner‐oriented codes relating to “mental preparation,” “self‐reliance,” “training – inner,” “wholeness,” “performance – inner,” and “growth orientation.” These findings highlight the importance of both inner‐ and outer‐oriented development for high‐level achievement in sports – the “mental game” is as important as the physical game, both during training and competitions. Previously published quantitative data reported higher levels of brain integration, faster habitation to a loud tone, and higher ego and moral development in these world‐class athletes. These findings are interpreted in light of a Unified Theory of Performance, which proposes that higher mind‐brain development provides a basis for higher performance in any activity.

AB - This study explored the influence of age in understanding mental skills utilization in the context of performance at a major national golf competition. Participants, who ranged in age and in skill level, included 1,150 male and 170 female amateur golfers competing in the Dupont World Amateur Golf Championship in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Measures targeted general mental skills used in competitions, golf-specific skills, and competitive trait anxiety. Hierarchical linear regression was utilized to explore the potential moderating role that chronological age may play in influencing the impact of psychological skills and anxiety on competitive tournament performance across the adult life span. Findings suggested no significant age-moderating effects and instead pointed to the importance of developing golf-specific psychological skills to enhance or maintain performance, irrespective of age. Although automaticity (performance feels “automatic”) predicted performance for all golfers, commitment to the game and confidence in one’s putting did so only for the men. These findings reinforce the age-irrelevant role of such skills in fostering the experience of peak performance in a competitive sport context and underscore the importance of interventions targeting older players to help maintain or facilitate the use of psychological skills in helping them manage their games.

AB - Background: To examine the dose-response relationship between health related quality of life (HRQoL) and life satisfaction (outcomes) and duration of recreational physical activity (exposure). Further, to explore whether these relationships depend on type of physical activity (PA). Methods: 793 Australian rural-living women self-reported on duration of recreational PA; HRQoL via SF-36 Mental Component Summary (MCS) and Physical Component Summary (PCS); and a life satisfaction scale. ANOVAs and ANCOVAs investigated differences in outcomes (MCS, PCS, and life satisfaction) between tertiles of exposure to recreational PA, and types of PA (club sport, gymnasium, walking), with adjustment for potential confounders. Results: A significant positive dose-response relationship was found between PCS and level of PA. Furthermore, this relationship depended on type of PA, with club-sport participants recording higher PCS than non-club-sport participants in all but the highest tertile of exposure. Life satisfaction and MCS were not significantly related to level of PA. Conclusion: Physical health was positively associated with level of recreational PA, with club sport participation contributing greater benefits at low to moderate exposures than participation in gymnasium or walking activities.

AB - In this study, we examined the moderating effects of social support, athletic identity, and mental toughness on the life stress–injury relationships in a sample of 92 NCAA Division I-A football players from an intact team. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that there were no significant main effects of positive or negative life stress, social support, athletic identity, and mental toughness on injury outcome. However, significant interaction effects with positive life stress were found for family social support and mental toughness. These findings suggest that athletes who have low levels of mental toughness and family social support miss more practice and competition days owing to injury when they experience high levels of positive life stress. The results are consistent with the Williams and Andersen (1998) injury model, but extend it by demonstrating that mental toughness is a moderator of the relationship between positive life stress and injury outcome.

AB - This dissertation describes two studies based on data collected during a 3-month, season-long enjoyment-focused mental skills training (MST) intervention with a team of Division I female soccer players. Study 1 evaluates the effectiveness of the season-long intervention utilizing quantitative data to compare treatment and control groups. Study 2 describes how and why the intervention was implemented, utilizing quantitative and qualitative data from the treatment group to identify effect "process" variables. Repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance results from Study 1 revealed that the MST intervention significantly increased sport enjoyment, key mental training skills, and athletic performance both, in practice and competition, compared to the control group. Results from Study 2 demonstrated through case study, cross-case analyses and individual engagement scores how a MST program can enhance the quantity and quality of sport sources of enjoyment (SOE), the primary SOE present in collegiate soccer, autonomy-supportive SOE, the role of athletic engagement and how different components become more prominent at different points of the intervention, and sport enjoyment's impact on athletic performance. The discussion focuses on the role of the working implementation model in intervention effectiveness. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Purpose: The purpose of this research was three-fold: (1) to examine the impact of hypermasculinity, sport injury, degree of injury, sport level, age range, race, marital status, and years active on mental health attitudes (perceptions of mental illness and averseness to help); (2) to predict what factors most likely contribute to mental health attitudes; and (3) to describe hypermasculinity outside of the context of other groups. Methods: One hundred and twenty-two male high-collision athletes from the NFL Players Association and the Washington, DC Metro area were recruited to participate in this study. The mixed-methods strategy employed in this study was sequential explanatory strategy. Three standardized and self-administered instruments were used to collect the quantitative data. These are (1) Attitude Scale for Mental Illness (ASMI) (Ng & Chan, 2000), (2) Inventory of Attitudes toward Seeking Mental Health Services (IASMHS) (Mackenzie, Knox, Gekoski, & Macaulay, 2004), and (3) Athlete's Perception of Masculinity (APMS). In addition, Skype and telephone interviews were utilized to collect the qualitative data. Data Analysis: Statistical tests utilized to analyze quantitative data included Pearson's correlation coefficient, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), and canonical correlation analysis. To analyze qualitative research questions, relational analysis and cognitive mapping were used. Results: This study found that though athletes have high levels of hypermasculinity (mean=19.66, SD=7.43), they still hold positive perceptions of mental illness (mean=126, SD=16.53) and are receptive to mental health assistance (mean=55.98, SD=16.41). This conclusion indicates that hypermasculinity is a trait of the athlete and not his defining characteristic. Other sport-related or personal characteristics, including marital status, sport level, age range, and degree of injury were predictors of perceptions of mental health and receptivity to help. Additionally, education, awareness of self and others, and self-reliance emerged as protective factors against averseness to help. Implications: This study has many implications on understanding the perceptions that are held by athletes regarding mental health, the barriers that limit or prevent athletes who are in need of mental health services from getting help, and the role the profession of social work can play in providing those services. These implications are discussed in detail in chapter 5. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Past research has examined the experience and differences of athletic mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) between female and male athletes. However, the experiences of how female athletes recover and cope with a sport-related mTBI have not previously been studied. This study looked at the experiential change in female athletes who have sustained a sport-related mTBI (i.e., concussion); specifically exploring the impact on identity associated with recovery, coping, returning to sport and/or transitioning (i.e., retiring) from sport for female athletes. A total of 13 female athletes, aged 19-37, who currently and/or previously competed at the professional, elite, or college level in their respective sport and who self-identified as having sustained a sport-elated mTBI were recruited and participated in semi-structured interviews. Through qualitative content analysis, themes about the participants' experience of sustaining an mTBI emerged. Findings indicated that most female athletes were unaware of the symptoms, injury management, and recovery process associated to sustaining a sport-related mTBI. Mild traumatic brain injury symptoms experienced by the female athlete included: feeling dizzy, fatigued, difficulty concentrating, memory loss, restlessness, difficulty sleeping, headache, sensitivity to light/noise, and emotional difficulties (e.g., anxiety, depression, anger). The female athlete tended to minimize mTBI symptoms in order to continue training and/or competing. Overall, not being able to train and/or compete during the recovery process was found to be an extremely challenging experience that caused emotional and psychological difficulties (i.e., depression, anxiety, and anger) as well as prolonging the recovery process. During the recovery process the female athlete found having social support; e.g., family, friends, teammates, coaches, athletic trainers, team directors to be a helpful coping mechanism. Surprisingly, few sought support from professional therapists, sport psychologists, or mental training consultants. Changes in athletic identity, fear around sustaining another mTBI, and motivation to explore new identities and pursue new professional goals also emerged. Practical implications are offered, outlining ways that individuals working with or who are close to female athletes can offer psychologically and physically helpful support. Limitations of the study and future research are also included. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Mental toughness is a topic that has received growing attention in psychological literature over the past decade. Although some researchers have attempted to understand how mental toughness is developed, little effort has been made to integrate an understanding of mental toughness development with established psychological theory and research. The aim of our review is to demonstrate the utility of theory and research on motivation for understanding mental toughness and its development. In particular, we propose that self-determination theory provides a sound basis for understanding the motivational antecedents of mental toughness. To achieve our aim, we consider concepts that bridge mental toughness and self-determination theory literature, namely striving , surviving , and thriving . We conclude our review with suggestions for future lines of empirical enquiry that could be pursued to further test our propositions.

AB - Psychological Skills Training (PST) has been a tool used by sport psychology consultants. However, within soccer many of these programs have been delivered as workshops, homework tasks, or individual consultations with athletes. The aim of the project was to develop an ecological intervention by creating a series of drill-based sessions to train psychological skills, and educate coaches about how to implement and integrate PST as a natural part of daily training. The program was delivered to the youth academies in nine Danish professional soccer clubs and consisted of three phases: (a) planning of the program, (b) education and designing soccer drills, and (c) delivery of the drills on the soccer pitch. The program was well received by clubs, coaches, and players. With regards to project aims, the intervention was generally considered a success. Coaches reported that the drill-based nature of the program was practical and relevant to young players’ development of psychological skills and many players and coaches have continued working with this approach. However, success varied across the nine clubs and was influenced by factors such as the clubs’ willingness and capacity to adopt new concepts, the presentation of sport psychology in soccer language, and time constraints.

AB - The present study examines the relationship between individual differences in evaluative self-organisation and mental toughness in sport, proposing that motivation and emotional resiliency (facets of mental toughness) stem from differences in core self. A cross-sectional assessment of 105 athletes competing at a range of performance levels took part in an online study including measures of self-reported mental toughness (Sport Mental Toughness Questionnaire; Sheard, M., Golby, J., & van Wersch, A. (2009). Progress towards construct validation of the Sports Mental Toughness Questionnaire (SMTQ). European Journal of Psychological Assessment, 25 (3), 186–193. doi:10.1027/1015-5759.25.3.186) and self-organisation (self-descriptive attribute task; Showers, C. J. (2002). Integration and compartmentalisation: A model of self-structure and self-change. In D. Cervone & W. Mischel (Eds.), Advances in personality science (pp. 271–291). New York, NY: Guilford Press). As predicted, global mental toughness was associated with self-concept positivity, which was particularly high in individuals with positive-integrative self-organisation (individuals who distribute positive and negative self-attributes evenly across multiple selves). Specifically, positive integration was associated with constancy (commitment to goal achievement despite obstacles and the potential for failure), which extends presumably from positive integratives’ emotional stability and drive to resolve negative self-beliefs.

AB - Sport Psychology provides a synthesis of the major topics in sport psychology with an applied focus and an emphasis on achieving optimal performance. After exploring the history of sport psychology, human motivation, and the role of exercise, there are three main sections to the text: Performance Enhancement, Performance Inhibition, and Individuals and Teams. The first of these sections covers topics such as anxiety, routines, mental imagery, self-talk, enhancing concentration, relaxation, goals, and self-efficacy. The section on Performance Inhibition includes chapters on choking under pressure, self-handicapping, procrastination, perfectionism, helplessness, disruptive personality factors, substance abuse, burnout, and injuries. While much of the information presented is universally applicable, individual differences based on gender, ethnicity, age. and motivation are emphasized in the concluding section on Individuals and Teams. Leadership and team cohesion are also studied. Throughout, there are case studies of well-known athletes from a variety of sports to illustrate topics that are being explored.

AB - Mindfulness has become a vital skill for many people working in the fields of physical and mental health, teaching, business, leadership and sports. While plenty of books explain the uses of mindfulness, until now none has addressed the particular challenges of effectively passing these skills on to clients in a user-friendly way. Designed to help professionals introduce mindfulness to clients, the skills laid out here can help those struggling with problems of recurrent stress or ruminative thought and benefit people wanting to live in a more effective, rewarding way Incorporating a series of practical exercises and drawing on their own professional experience, the authors clearly demonstrate the most effective methods for presenting mindfulness techniques to those with no previous experience. Topics covered include: orienting the client to the skill; obtaining and using client feedback effectively; introducing simple practices; teaching clients to utilise mindfulness in everyday life; case scenarios demonstrating the skills in practice. This practical, structured guide is essential for professionals already teaching or planning to teach mindfulness skills, those taking courses or workshops and for anyone interested in learning more about mindfulness.

We cannot, within the space of this chapter, present a truly “comprehensive” description of services that sport psychology consultants might provide. Also, sport psychology practitioners come from a variety of backgrounds (e.g., exercise science, psychology, education) and use different service delivery models. There are, however, some important common components of consultation that sport psychology consultants should be familiar and comfortable with as they embark upon work with athletes (see also Poczwardowski & Sherman, 2011). These components include factors that affect the start of service delivery, the working alliance, assessment, intervention, record keeping, and the termination process.

AB - Experiencing self-esteem is one of the most important of psychological needs. It is associated with good mental health, how well we cope with the stresses and strains we face, and has an important influence on our choice of and persistence in behaviours. Our level of self-esteem is determined by the way we see ourselves, or our self-perceptions in the many aspects of life in which we are involved. Those aspects closest to us are the most salient, such as family and friendships, and how we look and how we perform at school or work. This complex of experiences is used to form an overall impression of worth or esteem that carries powerful emotions such as pride and shame. Because we enjoy feeling good about ourselves, we tend to make the most of those aspects of life which provide success and achievement and avoid negative experiences. Sport and exercise involvement is very public and can have strong positive or negative effects on self-perceptions and self-esteem. If coaches, teachers and health professionals are to get the best out of people in terms of their achievement and psychological well-being, it is critical that they understand the whole person and how experiences they help to create affect an individual's self-perceptions and self-esteem. This chapter presents examples from exercise participation and sport performance settings to help leaders develop effective strategies for fostering positive self-perceptions and self-esteem.

AB - A 'funny thing really did happen on my way to a PhD in sociology of sport'; I changed to psychology of sport and eventually I evolved into an applied sport psychology practitioner (i.e.. Mental Skills Trainer). I'm still asking myself 'How the heck did that happen?' Well, actually I do know in a temporal sense. Becoming a sport psychologist, or more accurately a 'mental skills trainer' (the terminology used in New Zealand for someone who is not a registered/certified psychologist), was certainly not a linear, goal-directed process for me. In many ways I stumbled across sport psychology by chance, but once I had discovered 'gold', I was motivated to 'mine' it! As previously stated, I clearly saw the connection between mental skills training (e.g., motivation, commitment, mental toughness) and life skills training (i.e., character-building in sport), and it was my view that mental skills training (MST) should not be conceived as being exclusively focused on sports performance; instead I believed that the skills we teach via MST were indeed 'life' skills, applicable to any life domain (e.g., school, sport, home, job, career, relationships). For example, the two MST issues outlined above (team-building and intuitive decision-making) should be viewed as being applicable to many life situations; sport may offer us an opportunity to test and develop these skills but they should be regarded as being portable and transferable to other life domains (Hodge et al., in press). With respect to the last point above, I welcome the recent emphasis in general psychology on a strengths-based approach to positive psychology and the recent widening of the scope of practice in our field to 'performance' psychology (Martin, 2012), not just sport/exercise psychology. By expanding our definition of 'performance' to life skills, I believe we have a wonderful opportunity as a field to deliver more meaningful contributions to the psychological well-being of our athlete-clients and to society as a whole.

AB - Despite the well-known mental health benefits of exercise, collegiate athletes may be at an increased risk of depression due to the number of stressors they face (Gill, 2008; Yang et al., 2007), and this risk may be even greater for female athletes (Donohue et al., 2004; Storch, Storch, Killikany, and Roberti, 2005). It has been suggested that a greater understanding of personal experiences would be helpful in increasing awareness and improving treatment. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to explore the lived experience of depression in female collegiate athletes. In-depth, unstructured interviews were conducted with 10 current and former female collegiate athletes. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using phenomenological research methods (Dale, 1996, 2000). Thematic analysis revealed one ground (the role of sport) and four general categories (weariness, self-doubt, out of control, and nowhere to go). Practical implications and recommendations are made for athletes and coaches. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)

AB - When coaches and athletes lose competitions, they often attribute their loses to mental factors such as a loss in concentration, failure to cope with anxiety, or a lack of confidence. Although there is much written about specific techniques to build mental skills such as imagery, relaxation, goal-setting and self talk, less is known about how to exactly develop and implement a mental skills training (MST) program. Thus the focus of this chapter is to provide specific guidelines for the development and implementation of mental skills in sport. First, the effectiveness of mental training programs is discussed along with the knowledge base that underlies these programs and who should implement them. Then, when to implement MST as well as how long to practice different mental skills, is presented. Finally, using Poczwardowski, Sherman, and Henschen (1998) heuristic as a model, how to actually implement a MST program is presented including such things as defining one's boundaries as a sport psychology consultant, the importance of philosophy, the assessment of mental skills from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives, determining what mental skills to include, setting up a schedule for practicing mental skills and evaluating the program.

AB - In this paper, the authors discuss the symptoms of overtraining and burnout—two syndromes in which the etiology, after the decades of research, is still poorly understood. Overtraining is caused by an imbalance between exercise and rest, and often triggered by increased neuromuscular loading. There are no reliable diagnostic tests for overtraining. The neurological mechanisms underpinning burnout are similarly not known; however, it is generally accepted that the main cause is mental overloading. Both conditions are stress-related developmental processes suggesting malfunction of adrenal cortex and hypothalamus, mainly the pituitary. The two syndromes are also related to a variety of individual, environmental, and organizational factors. Based on the first author's extensive practical experience of working with overtrained athletes and individuals with occupational burnout, the authors draw on both literatures to offer invaluable insights into a medical assessment and treatment of athletes suffering from overtraining.

What are the cognitive processes involved in team decision-making? In this chapter the reader is introduced to the basic perceptual-cognitive processes, which determine the act of decision-making. The chapter introduces the cognitive components underlying the decision-making process, such as visual attention, selective attention, working and long-term memory, mental representations, and knowledge base and structure. Briefly presented are affective/emotional variables, which affect the cognitive processes underpinning response selection and action execution. A cognitive perspective leads the section describing team decision-making. Shared mental models are presented as the underlying mechanisms of decision-making within a team framework.

AB - Physical activity can make participants feel better, an effect that has wide-ranging applications for promoting mental health and increasing motivation for continued physical activity participation. Numerous studies have shown that physical activity can lower anxiety and depression, two mental health problems that impact the quality of life of millions of people. Furthermore, if certain conditions are met, physical activity can increase feelings of energy and calmness, thus offering a healthful alternative to widely consumed but unhealthy chemical agents that are often used as affective-state regulators (e.g., sugar, caffeine, alcohol, nicotine). This chapter summarizes the key findings in this line of research and outlines what exercise professionals can do to increase the likelihood that physical activity will result in positive affective experiences.

AB - With so many individuals engaged in sports competition, and with an estimated 20% of the general population likely to personally experience a mental illness in their lifetime (Public Health Agency of Canada, Canada, 2006), it should not be surprising that some elite athletes may experience psychopathological disorders. The pressures of the sport environment, for some, may become too great, and result in decompensation and distress. In this chapter, we discuss some of the more likely mental health diagnoses that may arise in the context of sport performance. While almost any coach, trainer, or athlete will have a range of strategies for managing pre-performance anxiety or post-loss disappointment, the skilled sport psychologist must be able to distinguish between what falls within this "normal" range and what may represent a mental health concern, crossing over into the realm of significant pathology. The dividing line rests in being able to apply formal diagnostic criteria, thereby avoiding either downplaying major problems (e.g., normalizing eating disorders as being "part of the sport") or exaggerating situational stressors (e.g., an athlete's anxiety about "making the team").

AB - Purpose: To explore the psychosocial outcomes of an inclusive adapted sport and adventurous training course that aims to support the rehabilitation and personal development of military personnel who have sustained physical and/or psychological disability. Method: Narrative life story interviews were conducted with 11 men aged 20–43 taking part in one of the 5-day courses. A thematic narrative analysis was conducted, focusing on accounts that provided insights into personally meaningful psychosocial outcomes of the course. Findings: We identified six themes, falling into two distinct clusters. “Bringing me back to myself” was achieved through the themes of (1) returning to activity, (2) rediscovering a sense of purpose, and (3) reconnecting to others. "New rooms to explore" was realised through (4) experiencing new activities, (5) being valued/respected/cared for and (6) being inspired by other people. Conclusion: Involvement in the course stimulated a balance of present- and future-oriented psychosocial outcomes through which participants both recreated aspects of themselves that had been lost through injury/trauma and moved forward with their lives as a result of new horizons of possibility. Implications for Rehabilitation: (a) This 5-day inclusive adapted sport and adventurous training course offered meaningful psychosocial outcomes among military personnel who had experienced physical and/or psychological disability. (b) The course helped participants recover aspects of their previous life and self through becoming physically active again, rediscovering a sense of purpose and reconnecting to others. (c) Participants describe a broadening of life horizons as a result of the course, through new activities, being valued/respected/cared for, and being inspired by other people.

AB - Although sport psychologists have started to examine elite disability sport, studies of comprehensive mental skill use are rare. In the current study, we examined multidimensional imagery and self-talk, as well as comprehensive mental skills (i.e., coping with adversity, goal setting, concentration, peaking under pressure, being coachable, confident, and feeling free from worry). In addition to descriptive data, we also were interested in the ability of athlete’s mental skills to predict engagement (e.g., being dedicated). Fourteen elite level wheelchair rugby players from the United States participated, and results indicated that athletes employed most mental skills. We accounted for 50% of the variance in engagement with comprehensive mental skills (β = .72, p = .03) contributing the most to the regression equation, while imagery (β = -.02, p = .94) and self-talk (β = -.00, p = .99) were not significant. Athletes who reported using a host of mental skills (e.g., coping with adversity) also reported being engaged (e.g., dedicated, enthused, committed) to wheelchair rugby. Athletes reporting minimal mental skill use were less engaged. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - This study was aimed at capturing the components comprising shared mental models (SMM) and the training methods used to address SMM in one athletic program context. To meet this aim, two soccer coaches from the same collegiate program were interviewed and observed extensively during practices and games throughout the 2009–2010 season. In addition, documents (e.g., players’ positioning on free kicks sheet) from the soccer program were reviewed. The data were analyzed inductively through a thematic analysis to develop models that operationalize SMM through its components, and training. Game intelligence and game philosophy were the two main operational themes defining SMM. Moreover, four themes emerged for SMM training: (a) the setting, (b) compensatory communication, (c) reinforcement, and (d) instruction. SMM was embedded within a more comprehensive conceptual framework of team chemistry, including emotional, social, and cognitive dimensions. Implications of these conceptual frameworks are considered for sport psychologists and coaches. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - Objectives: This study examined the frequency and predictors of hospitalization and emergency room (ER) use among residents with Alzheimer's disease at admission and after 1 year in a long-term care facility. Method: This secondary analysis used data collected with the Chinese version of the Residential Assessment Instrument Minimum Data Set 2.0 during the Hong Kong Longitudinal Study on Long-Term Care Facility Residents. Results: A sample of 169 residents with Alzheimer's disease who were newly admitted between 2005 and 2010 was included in the analysis. Mixed-effects modeling was adopted to assess the associations between risk factors and the frequency of hospitalization and ER use. At admission, 27 (15.98%) respondents had been hospitalized and 19 (11.24%) required ER services during the previous 90 days. At admission, polypharmacy (β = .081, p < .01) and use of psychotropic drugs (β = ‐.506, p < .05) were significantly associated with frequency of hospitalization. At 1-year follow-up, cognitive impairment (β = .088, p < .05) and polypharmacy (β = .058, p < .001) had significant positive associations with frequency of hospitalization, as well as use of ER services (β = .084, p < .01; β = .077, p < .001, respectively). Use of psychotropic drugs had a negative association with frequency of ER use at both time points. Conclusion: Practitioners should periodically observe cognitive ability, polypharmacy, and use of psychotropic drugs among long-term care residents with Alzheimer's disease.

AB - The prevalence of psychiatric conditions among elite athletes is still under debate. More and more evidence has accumulated that high-performance athletes are not protected from mental disorders as previously thought. The authors discuss the issue of the sport specificity of selected mental diseases in elite athletes. Specific aspects of eating disorders, exercise addiction, chronic traumatic encephalopathy and mood disorders in the context of overtraining syndrome are examined. In particular, the interrelationship between life and work characteristics unique to elite athletes and the development of mental disorders are reviewed. Differences of clinical presentation and some therapeutic consequences are discussed. The authors suggest that the physical and mental strains endured by elite athletes might influence the onset and severity of their psychiatric disorder. Beside the existing research strategies dealing with the amount of exercise, its intensity and lack of recreation experienced by athletes, further research on psycho-social factors is needed to better understand the sport-specific aetiology of mental disorders in high-performance athletes.

AB - The aim of this study was to assess differences in psychological well-being, symptomatic psychological disorders and social participation, between competitive wheelchair basketball participants and those non-participants. Forty-six wheelchair participants, 24 Basketball players (aged 35.60 ± 7.56) and 22 non-players (aged 36.20 ± 6.23), completed three validated self-report questionnaires: Participation Scale (PS), Psychological Well-Being Scale [PWBS] and Symptom Checklist 90 R [SCL-90-R]. ANOVA showed significant overall differences between the two groups. The social restriction score, evaluated by PS, was significantly higher in the non-basketball participants ( p = 0.00001) than the basketball participants. The PWB Scale showed significant differences in all 6 dimensions: positive relations with others, environmental mastery, personal growth, purpose in life and self-acceptance ( p < 0.01), and autonomy ( p < 0.05), with better scores in the basketball participants. The SCL-90-R scores were significantly lower for the basketball group in the following 6 symptomatic dimensions: depression, phobic anxiety, and sleep disorder ( p < 0.01), somatization, interpersonal sensitivity and psychoticism (with p < 0.05). It was concluded that competitive wheelchair basketball participants showed better psychological well-being and social skills than those non-participants.

The three figures were mislabeled and in the wrong order. All versions of this article have been corrected.] The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a mental toughness intervention delivered to a group of elite youth cricketers. The central feature of the intervention was repeated exposure to punishment-conditioned stimuli in the training environment. To avoid the potentially harmful effects of punishment, the intervention was designed and delivered in a multidisciplinary transformational manner, and participants were taught a variety of coping strategies to deal with the threatening environment. A mixed model (group × time) design was used to compare the intervention group against a comparison control group on various markers of mental toughness over time. Generally speaking, the intervention group demonstrated significant improvements in mental toughness in comparison with the control group. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretically derived mental toughness intervention that has shown meaningful effects that can be differentiated from general psychological skills training effects. Theoretical implications are discussed in the context of systematic desensitization training (Wolpe, 1958), and applied recommendations are offered in relation to the intelligent use of punishment in athletic training environments.

AB - One hundred twenty university counseling centers and athletic-department websites were viewed and analyzed for the provision of sport psychology services specifically to NCAA (National Collegiate Athletic Association) Division I Football Bowl Championship Series (FBS) student athletes. Using content-analysis methodology, the present research identified a fair number of university athletic departments ( n = 29) and university counseling centers ( n = 6) that provided specific sport psychology services. In addition, most athletic departments and counseling centers that provided sport psychology services had one individual on staff who was listed as the service provider. Results of the study are discussed in relation to providing a current understanding of the extent to which sport psychology is presently being provided to NCAA Division I FBS university student athletes. Future qualitative research is recommended to examine the work of professionals providing sport psychology services in athletic departments and counseling centers to better understand the precise nature of the services provided.

AB - Objectives: To examine the use of relaxation skills by differentially skilled athletes in relation to the deliberate practice framework. Design: Differentially skilled athletes completed a survey about their use of relaxation skills. Method: 150 athletes representing three skill levels (recreational, college, and professional) completed the deliberate relaxation for sport survey, which assessed relaxation on three deliberate practice dimensions (relevancy, concentration, and enjoyment); time spent in different relaxation skills in a recent typical week; and functions of relaxation. Results: Athletes perceived relaxation as relevant to performance, requiring concentration, and enjoyable, and the relationships between these dimensions were positive. Professional and college athletes perceived relaxation as more relevant to effective competition than recreational athletes. Professional athletes engaged in more relaxation in a typical week than college and recreational athletes. In a typical week, autogenic, eastern, and muscle relaxation types were used least, deep breathing, meditation, and imagery relaxation types moderately, and stretching most. Athletes reported the primary functions of relaxation were to cope with competitive anxiety and promote recovery but relaxation was also reported to be used to cope with “everyday” anxieties associated with being an athlete. More physical (e.g., muscle relaxation) than mental relaxation types were used in relation to coping with competitive anxiety, whereas more mental (e.g., meditation) than physical relaxation types were used in relation to coping with everyday anxiety. Conclusions: The study provides support for the sport-specific framework of deliberate practice in relation to use of relaxation skills and informs the current understanding of self-regulation by athletes.

AB - Reviews the book, Sports Psychiatry: Strategies for Life Balance and Peak Performance by David R. McDuff (see record 2012-10867-000). This book provides a detailed "road map for mental health providers, athletic trainers, and sports medicine practitioners involved in the care of athletes." Dr. McDuff covers the scope of his practice, mental preparation, stress recognition and control, energy regulation. The text is heavy with case examples, backed up by the growing and relevant psychiatric literature. The book is very helpful in its use of tables and graphs highlighting important issues, such as banned substances and data on concussions in different sports. It is also practical, providing detailed information on the mentioned topics. There is a long-standing organization of sports psychiatrist pioneers called the International Society for Sports Psychiatry, whose scientific sessions have been helpful in developing the field. In addition to attending the annual meetings of this organization,the author highly recommend Dr. McDuff’s book to psychiatrists, psychologists, and other mental health professionals. Finally, author recommend this text as a valuable resource to owners, athletic directors, coaches,managers, general managers, agents, and even commissioners of professional leagues, as well as to the National Collegiate Athletic Association and their staff.

In the first article, the author elegantly incorporates the structural dissociation model developed by van der Hart, Nijenhuis, and Steele with transactional analysis theories. In the next article, author takes us into a realm that most therapists try to skirt around. In her article, she writes about not only sexual transgressions but also general power imbalances as well as the notion of love. In the next article, author pertains to her work with a woman suffering from that chronic disease. In another article, the author begins by writing about how in South Africa, few clients have the luxury of coming to therapy for months or years. Therefore, she needs ways of accessing the child ego state swiftly and effectively, and she demonstrates this with powerful examples. In the article, the author describe sports psychology. He uses transactional analysis concepts in various ways, working with medium-term contracts of a few months. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - In recent years, there was a proliferation of research on resilience. However, there is little research on intervention to promote resilience in junior athletes, and the application of resilience in sport psychology is still in its infancy. In this study, based on Galli and Vealey [(2008). “Bouncing back” from adversity: Athletes’ experiences of resilience. The Sport Psychologist, 28 , 316–335] model, a sport psychological resilience training program was designed and implemented for a selected group of Hong Kong junior athletes. Participants, 69 in total, were Hong Kong national junior athletes from windsurfing, table tennis, fencing, billiard, and squash. Participants were randomly put into (a) resilience group ( n = 21), (b) traditional mental skill group ( n = 27), and (c) contrast group ( n = 21). The resilience group undertook the sport psychological resilience training program; the traditional mental skill group undertook a series of training in sport psychological mental skill; and the contrast group did not receive any psychological training related to resilience and sport psychological mental skill at all. The Resilience Scale for Chinese Adolescents (RSCA), the Athletes’ Resilience Questionnaire (ARQ), the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS), and the Mental Skill Questionnaire (MSQ) were implemented before and after the training. Through comparing and analyzing the pre- and post-findings, the researchers found that resilience training program derived from Galli and Vealey [(2008). “Bouncing back” from adversity: Athletes’ experiences of resilience. The Sport Psychologist, 28 , 316–335] model was statistically effective in improving Hong Kong junior athletes’ overall psychological resilience, although the improvements in sub-scales “Family Support” and “Help Seeking” were not significant. Moreover, the effect of the resilience training program on athletes’ resilience was better than the traditional mental skill training. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of the traditional mental skill training was significantly better than the resilience training program on “Concentration”, whereas there was no difference in other four variables of athletes’ traditional mental skill between resilience group and traditional mental skill group.

AB - This study investigated whether mental toughness distinguishes mixed martial arts (MMA) athletes competing at different levels. It was theorized that higher mental toughness would separate those competing at the professional level compared to lower levels. Male MMA competitors ( N = 136, M age = 27.1 yr., SD = 4.8) were categorized as amateur, semi-professional, or professional and assessed by questionnaire using the Psychological Performance Inventory–A and the Sports Mental Toughness Questionnaire. There were statistically significant differences between the three groups on mental toughness. The professional group had higher scores compared to semi-professional and amateur groups with regard to confidence, positive cognition, and determination. The findings supported previous work that athletes performing at higher levels have superior mental toughness. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - Reviews the book, USTA Mental Skills and Drills Handbook edited by L. Lauer, D. Gould, P. Lubbers & M. Kovacs (2010). This book is a practical educational resource for tennis coaches, sport psychology practitioners, and tennis players who want greater understanding of mental skills in tennis. The book contains 28 chapters organized into 11 sections and begins by introducing the importance of mental skills and how a coach can begin to develop them. The following five sections contain chapters that each examine a particular mental skill, namely (a) goal setting, (b) energy management, (c) confidence (e.g., self-confidence, self-talk, body language, a positive approach to mistakes), (d) imagery, and (e) concentration. Overall, the book successfully achieves the difficult task of covering several core mental skills, explaining them in an engaging and understandable way, and providing easy routes for implementation, while avoiding overwhelming the reader.

AB - The ability to successfully develop to the highest levels in sport is dependent on a range of variables, not least an individual’s ability to cope with the various challenges of development. Psychological Characteristics of Developing Excellence (PCDEs) include both the trait characteristics and the state-deployed skills that have been shown to play a crucial role in the realisation of potential. Psychological characteristics of developing excellence equip aspiring elites with the mental skills, attitudes, and emotions to cope with the challenges of the development pathway, as well as underpinning their capacity to make the most of their innate abilities. The Psychological Characteristics of Developing Excellence Questionnaire (PCDEQ) was designed to assess the possession and deployment of these characteristics. The purpose of this paper was to examine the ability of the Psychological Characteristics of Developing Excellence Questionnaire to effectively discriminate between good and poor developers based on their current possession and deployment of psychological characteristics of developing excellence. Two hundred and eighty-five athletes ( n = 192 team athletes; n = 93 individual athletes) completed the Psychological Characteristics of Developing Excellence Questionnaire. Results from the discriminant function analysis suggest that the Psychological Characteristics of Developing Excellence Questionnaire correctly classifies between 67% and 75% of athletes based on their responses. The Psychological Characteristics of Developing Excellence Questionnaire can be used as a formative assessment tool to direct training programmes by identifying weaknesses in psychological characteristics of developing excellence and incorporating specific training to address these weaknesses in advance of developmental challenges.

AB - Mental toughness has been explored predominantly within sport contexts. Nevertheless, it is difficult to conceive mental toughness as only applicable to athletes. This study examines whether mentally tough participants exhibit resilience against stress. This is a cross-sectional study based on two different samples: Sample 1 consisted of 284 high school students (99 males, 185 females, M = 18.3 years). Sample 2 consisted of 140 first through fifth semester undergraduate students (53 males, 87 females, M = 20.0 years). Participants provided information about their level of perceived stress (10-item Perceived Stress Scale), mental toughness (48-item Mental Toughness Questionnaire) and depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory). Consistent across the two samples, mental toughness mitigated the relationship between high stress and depressive symptoms. The interaction between stress and mental toughness explained 2% of variance in the adolescent sample and 10% of variance among young adults. The promotion of protective factors that foster resilient adaptation is a relevant issue. Mental toughness may appeal to individuals that are typically difficult to be reached with health interventions. Because mental toughness is part of young people’s daily speech, it may serve as a less academic resource than other health psychology concepts.

AB - The early 21st century has witnessed a steady push by scientists, industry leaders, and government officials to make medicine more personalized. To date, the concept of personalized medicine has referred largely to the field of pharmacogenomics. In contrast, relatively few data exist regarding the application of preventive strategies such as physical exercise in the context of personalized medicine. Within this review, we highlight the extant literature and propose five strategies for scientists that may propel the exercise and sports science fields toward this global goal. Notably, these approaches are in addition to methods to maintain adherence to training—a well-known factor in determining exercise responsiveness. Briefly, these strategies include (1) evaluating participant responses to training at the individual as well as group level; (2) identifying sources of variability in responsiveness to training; (3) optimizing exercise dosing strategies to maximize benefits while minimizing barriers to participation; (4) evaluating the efficacy of multimodal interventions for relevant population subgroups; and (5) increasing the clinical relevance of study populations and outcomes in exercise trials. We look forward to seeing these strategies considered in trials of preventive health interventions such as exercise. Extensive future research in this area is needed for the vision of exercise as a personalized form of medicine to become a reality.

AB - Mental Toughness (MT), which refers to an inner focus and commitment to rise above challenges when facing adversity, is viewed as one of the most important psychological attributes in determining success in sport. However, there is little consensus on key components of MT, and existing measures vary greatly while focusing on elite athletes. The purpose of this research was to develop a measure of MT for use with college athletes. Collegiate and noncollegiate athletes ( N = 271) completed the original 54-item Mental Toughness Scale (MTS) in study 1. Factor analysis (PCA) results reduced the scale to an 11-item scale, with good reliability and validity as demonstrated by its positive correlations with self-esteem and flow. A second study of college basketball players ( N = 143) was conducted to establish the psychometric properties of the MTS. Study 2 demonstrated convergent, divergent and criterion validity through correlations with related measures, and a CFA provided moderate support for the MTS as a one-dimensional measure of mental toughness in sport.

AB - Reviews the book, Movement Therapy for Mental Illness. Fundamentals and Application by Gerd Hölter (2011). The number of movement therapy approaches is inexhaustible. A holistic view on the subject seems impossible, more so if sports and physiotherapy are included in the wide range of body therapies, body psychotherapies, dance therapy, energy oriented movement therapies, and the like. This book conceptualizes the term movement therapy as used in Germany, which includes physiotherapy, sports and movement therapy, and body psychotherapy. The author further outlines a phenomenological-anthropological view of movement and provides examples of body, Leib (lived body or embedded body in English), and movement literature in the sports and movement sciences. This book is of substantial significance to different movement, dance, body, and sports therapies in German speaking countries and fills a gap of a long missed comprehensive textbook on the discipline of movement therapy. It gives insight into the relationship of psychotherapy and movement therapy, is easy to read, and allows the reader to skim across chapters and subsections. The textbook pulls the reader into the pages and provides in-depth information about psychiatric illnesses. The aim of the textbook was to present an integral way of viewing the fundamentals and application of movement therapies. This goal has been well accomplished. This book is a textbook for movement therapists’ clinical practice as well as a resource for evidence based health care. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Resilience refers to a dynamic process encompassing positive adaption within the context of significant adversity. Implicit within this notion are two critical conditions: (1) exposure to significant threat or severe adversity; and (2) the achievement of positive adaptation despite such threats or adversity. A large number of children are exposed to marked psychosocial and environmental stressors in their lives, particularly during the "critical hours" immediately following the end of the school day. As a result, afterschool programs have proliferated in the United States. An important question, however, remains: do these programs contribute to the resiliency of youth exposed to significant adversity? The proposed study is part of a larger ongoing research study on the effects of the SquashSmarts program on academic and social variables. The study followed participants in the program for three years to appraise whether there was a difference in the effects of the program on the academic and social variables over time. This study also compared the program participants to a comparison group consisting of youth matched for school and age. Contrary to predictions, SquashSmarts participants did not improve on academic or social variables over the three years of participation in the program when compared to the comparison group. SquashSmarts did show some improvements on the academic and social variables but not at a significantly greater rate than the control group. Thus, these gains in protective factors could be due simply to age, development and maturity as opposed to the program itself. These results are discussed as well as implications for future outcome studies on afterschool programs. Additionally, implications for future research as well as policy and practice are discussed.

AB - Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are common sports related knee injuries. While increasing performance and decreasing ACL injury risks are both important for athletes, the underlying relationships between performance and ACL loading are still unknown. Studying the relationships between performance and ACL loading can provide important information in understanding injury mechanism as well as developing injury prevention strategies. In the current study, eighteen male and eighteen female collegiate aged recreational athletes conducted stop-jump and side-cutting tasks with different performance demands and techniques. Performance including jump height, approach speed, take-off speed, stance time, and mechanical work were evaluated among different jumping and cutting conditions. Peak ACL forces were estimated from an ACL loading model. ACL loading variables and peak ACL force variables were compared among different jumping and cutting conditions. The acute effects of performance demands on ACL loading were evaluated. The acute effects of movement patterns that should decrease ACL loading on performance outcomes were determined. Gender differences in lower extremity biomechanics were evaluated as a secondary purpose. ACL loading increased when the movement speed increased. Soft landing and landing with increased knee flexion decreased ACL loading but also decreased jump height and movement speed and increased mechanical work, which indicated decreased performance. Males and females demonstrated different knee sagittal plane motion. For individuals whose priority is injury prevention but not performance, adapting a slow movement pattern or soft landing pattern might decrease ACL injury risks. However, fast movements might not be avoidable during real sports competitions. The results suggest the importance of considering performance and ACL loading as a combined unit during injury risk evaluation and injury prevention. It is necessary to completely report the changes in performance in order to have a thorough understanding of training effects. The gender differences might provide information in developing gender specific ACL injury prevention programs. However, the current study only evaluated the acute relationships between performance and ACL loading. Long-term training effects on the relationships between performance and ACL loading need further investigations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Shared Mental Models (SMM) is a dynamic team-related cognitive process that governs team coordination when communication is limited or absent. In team sports, where overt communication is limited, and many actions are reactive in nature, the importance of SMM is prominent. This notion is even more salient under pressure. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop and validate a SMM measure in team sports. At the onset of the validation process, items were generated based on an a priori model which emerged from a separate qualitative inquiry with elite coaches. Following two experts' examination of the relatedness of the items' content to SMM, the Shared Mental Models in Team Sports Questionnaire (SMMTSQ) was administrated to 372 Israeli student-athletes from seven interactive team sports (e.g., soccer, basketball, and volleyball). To validate the structure of the SMMTSQ model, a CFA procedure was employed. Reliability of the SMMTSQ and it scales was estimated using stratified alpha coefficient. In addition, Test-retest reliability was calculated using a subset of 118 student-athletes. Concurrent and predictive validity were examined using team cohesion and perceived performance questionnaires respectively. The results of this study validated the SMMTSQ as a shared cognitions measure. Following its content approval and data collection, the SMMTSQ demonstrated a good fit to the data. Furthermore, stratified alpha coefficients were greater than .90 for all the scales and for the measure as a whole. Test-retest reliability was .86 supporting its stability over 10 days on average. Moderately high correlations with the team cohesion and perceived performance questionnaires supported the concurrent and predictive validity of the SMMTSQ. Overall, the SMMTSQ emerged to be a good instrument for measuring shared cognitions in team sports. Through providing vital information pertaining to areas in which cognitions are shared or unshared in a team, intervention programs can be tailored. Future research may explore the suitability of the SMMTSQ to capture SMM across skill levels and cultures. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - The predominant avenues for understanding sport from a psychological perspective rely primarily on empirically based explanations of athletes and athletics (see Cox, 2007; Gardner & Moore, 2006; Sheldon & Mellalieu, 2006; Weinberg & Gould, 1999). In response to this monocentristic focus, this study attempts to penetrate the underbelly of sport psychology, namely, the current lack of a polycentric imagination and the overall neglect of the experience of loss in athletic competition, which results in psychological one-sidedness and a symptomatic relation to loss. The following exploration of sport psychology employs an archetypal hermeneutic to pursue two primary tasks: (a) locate the gods who claim sport psychology, and (b) engage in a radical re-visioning of sport psychology so that the inherent value of loss is given a central place in the study of sport. Specifically, through the use of the archetypal method of reversion, the sport psychology constructs of motivation, concentration, aggression, and loss are each returned to a god, thus providing a deeper understanding of sport and sport psychology. This study challenges the zeitgeist paradigm of performance enhancement and pushes forth an approach that affirms the imagination as principal method, where each god is given his or her rightful place, thus ushering in and emphasizing the psychologically essential experience of loss in sport--elucidating a sport psychology that attempts to understand, live, and embrace loss.

AB - Athletes competing at all levels of sport are constantly working on ways to enhance their physical performance. Sport psychology research insists there are higher performance results among athletes who incorporate mental skills training into their practice and competition settings. In order to use the mental skills strategies effectively, athletes must be educated about how and when to implement them. Athletes who have a positive experience with mental skills training and strategy use will most likely continue to use them throughout their athletic career. This qualitative phenomenological study describes the mental skills training experiences of NCAA Division II softball catchers and their performance in sport. Ten female collegiate softball catchers (aged 18-22) participating at six universities in the Central Region of softball competition, agreed to participate in this study. Findings from this study revealed themes of mental skills training strategies and factors that contributed to the use of mental skills training strategies to enhance performance. The findings of this study resulted in suggestions for those who concern themselves with the education and development of student-athletes to improve their performance, as well as recommendations for future research.

AB - This dissertation describes two studies based on data collected during an 8-month, season-long mental toughness (MT) intervention with a team of Division I hockey players. Study 1 evaluates the effectiveness of the season-long intervention, utilizing both quantitative and qualitative data. Study 2 describes and examines support for a new Working Model of Mental Toughness Development (WMMTD) that was used to guide the season-long MT intervention. The results from Study 1 which are based on motivational style cluster analysis suggest that positively-motivated players experience the greatest benefit as a result of the MT intervention, whereas high-doubt performers experienced the least success. Additionally, two distinct case studies are presented that lend support to the overall effectiveness of the intervention. Results from Study 2 provide support for the WMMTD. Canonical correlation results demonstrated consistent support for model components, particularly sport mindset and mental toughness, and their relationship with performance. Consistent with hypotheses, increases in mental toughness and sport performance were shown throughout the season, and positive relationships were found between MT and mental skills training (MST) tools (i.e., goal-setting, self-talk, relaxation, and imagery), MST skills (i.e., self-confidence, optimism), and development-focused motivational style (MS). As hypothesized, negative relationships were found between MT and trait anxiety (i.e., MST skill) and doubt-oriented and failure-evader MSs. Motivational style and optimism appear to be key mediating variables in the development of MT and have a central role within the WMMTD. No significant relationships were found for the third component of the model well-being, even though it was not a central focus of the MT intervention. Overall, preliminary support for the WMMTD was provided. Implications and future directions were also discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - A nomological network on team dynamics in sports consisting of a multi-framework perspective is introduced. The aim was to explore the interrelationship among cohesion team mental models (TMM), collective-efficacy (CE) and perceived performance potential (PPP). A secondary aim was to assess intra and inter team variability among these team level properties. Three hundred and forty college soccer players of both genders (178 female, 52.4%; and 162 male 47.6%) and representing 17 different teams ( n = 8 female and 9 male) affiliated to the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) agreed to participate in the study. The participants were 20.38 years old on average ( SD = 2.12) and had 14.66 years ( SD = 3.92) of experience in the sport. They responded to surveys on team cohesion (i.e., The Group Environment Questionnaire), TMM (i.e., Team Assessment Diagnostic Measure), CE (i.e., Collective Efficacy Questionnaire for Sports) and PPP (i.e., Team Outcome Questionnaire). Descriptive and structural equation modeling analyses indicated that cohesion, TMM and CE are conceptually and statistically interrelated constructs. Specifically, cohesion was found to be an exogenous variable predicting both TMM and CE beliefs. These former team attributes were found to predict PPP which in turn accounted for approximately 60% of the variance of objective performance scores as measured by teams' season record. Altogether, findings of this study are congruent with the theoretical feasibility and statistical validity of an integrated view of team dynamics in sports. Applied implications involve the development of evidence-based protocols to enhance team PPP as related to cohesion, TMM and CE beliefs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Due to their intensive sporting activities, athletes might not only experience positive outcomes and a state of psychological wellbeing but also a considerable amount of stress which can contribute to psychopathological states. Research into psychopathology in sport is a relatively recent field of study and investigations have focused rather narrowly on a few limited areas of study. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of psychological intervention after a young tennis player experienced a manic episode which affected the emotional wellbeing of other individuals from the same sporting environment, including the coaches and other athletes. The intervention, directed at the coaching staff and athletes, was based on the Psychological Wellbeing Model developed by Carol Ryff.

AB - Literature on sport psychology has consistently referred to mental toughness as one of the most important psychological characteristics related to outcomes in sport, although researchers have, until recently, devoted little time to studying this concept. This review considers major definitions and conceptualizations, relating this construct to other similar or concurrent ones and trying to integrate several perspectives from diverse research communities into the study of mental toughness. We propose that mental toughness should be conceived as a dynamic ecological resource management system, in a conception that extends the concept of robustness to a meta-skill involving the dynamic integration of a wide variety of psychological resources, mobilized differently depending on the characteristics of each individual, the nature of specific problems, situations and contexts, and ways of facing up to tasks and the challenges of life.

AB - Mental toughness is one of the most common terms used in sport - by athletes, coaches, spectators and the media. However, it is also one of the least understood terms. This book examines the characteristics and development of mentally tough sport performers, and presents the cutting-edge research in this area. In these chapters, the author proposes that mental toughness is a personality style and mindset, and presents a compelling case for its inclusion within the positive psychological paradigm. This second edition has been updated to include new material on the characterisation, conceptualisation, measurement, and development of mental toughness. As in the first edition, the book includes a historical overview of empirical research, and also describes the conceptual arguments behind this research. Now packed with even more rigorous scientific evidence and bang up-to-date anecdotes from the world of sport, the book presents a fascinating explanation of why some athletes are successful, and how and why they stay on top. Mental Toughness: The Mindset Behind Sporting Achievement will be essential reading for all sport psychology, sport science, sport studies, and coaching students.

The book describes the mechanisms that influence peak performance or psychological performance deficits and the mental training process, and provides procedures that will take the guesswork out of typical assessment and mental training of athletes. Moving beyond compartmentalized therapeutic sessions in the office, the book presents methods that directly observe athletic performance during training and actual competition. The text also contains individual and team case studies to enhance its focus on individualized, efficacy-tested protocols for each individual athlete. An text for advanced courses in applied sport psychology, this book incorporates the American Board of Sport Psychology's protocols for athlete assessment and intervention.

AB - One of the strongest and most consistent correlates and predictors of suicidal behavior is the presence of a psychiatric disorder. In particular, those with depression, both major depressive disorders and bipolar disorders (commonly known as manic-depressive disorder), alcohol and drug abuse, and borderline personality disorder have a high incidence of fatal and nonfatal suicidal behavior. Of course, not all suicidal individuals have a psychiatric disorder, and the vast majority of people with psychiatric disorders do not engage in either fatal or non-fatal suicidal behavior but, nonetheless, psychiatric disorder is a risk factor for suicide. Reports of psychiatric disorder in professional athletes exist, but these problems have been hidden from the media and the public over the years. When a professional athlete does come forward and admits to having psychiatric problems, sometimes there is a stigma attached. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)

AB - With regard to mental health and well-being, watching games might increase a sense of belonging, allow for release of tension, induce positive mood and reduce the number of psychiatric presentations. The defeat of the favored team may lead to psychological distress, however, in some cases reaching clinically significant levels similar to the impact of traumatic events, such as physical threats and natural disasters. Being involved in sports as a spectator might also have an impact on suicidal behavior, either increasing the risk or being a protective factor, and this chapter reviews the evidence regarding this relationship.

AB - Stress is one of the principal problems found in the sports environment that can affect athletes, the coach and the umpire. Consequences are associated with the technical aspect (loss of prosecution), physical (lesions), cognitive (decline in the capacity of attention and decision making), behavioral (anxiety and nervousness) and social (interpersonal conflicts). Stress is understood as a totality of the reactions of organic adaptation, which objectify the maintenance or reestablishment of internal and/or external balance. From a psychological point of view, stress is related to the activation of the cognitive functions and is comprehended in general to the meaning of a psychological need or mental activity. Stressful situations or conditions of pressure can be modified according to the characteristic of each modality (individual, collective, gymnastics, combat) and level of activity required. Volleyball is an extremely dynamic modality that demands ability, precision and regularity from the athlete. These factors are associated with conditions of pressure that the athlete suffers during the competition, which can generate a reaction of stress and a probable lowering of performance. During episodes of stress, the athlete can experience various types of reactions with excessive nervousness, anxiety, psych-vegetative reactions and others. It is noteworthy that reactions to stress can be manifested in the athlete before, during and after the competition. The literature describes different techniques and strategies of intervention. In volleyball, some of the techniques most recommended are the mental routines (that can be applied before, during and/or after the match) and coping strategies. Diverse recommendations are offered to athletes and coaches in the management of stress to prevent the effects of this process (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)

AB - Mental practice routines play an important role in many different sports, not only for the acquisition of motor skills but also for preparation prior to competitive events and rehabilitation after sport injuries. Imagery techniques in sport are used for different purposes, as outlined by the Model of Imagery Use in Sports [Martin et al. (Sport Psychologist 13:245-268, 1999)], to improve skill acquisition, motivation, and sport confidence and to reduce anxiety. Individual differences in imagery abilities have to be considered to understand the possible effects of mental practice in the sports context. It has been revealed that a differentiation of expertise levels (experts and novices) and skills (closed and open) is important for the categorization of imagery effects in sport. Experts are more experienced in processing movement sensations compared with novices and can, therefore, generate kinesthetic imagery more easily. Open and closed skills differ in their predictability of the environment. Compared with closed skills, open skills specifically require the ability to imagine external events and changes to the environmental conditions. It has been shown that different forms and functions of imagery prove to be effective for the above-mentioned functions depending on the characteristics of different sports and the expertise level of athletes.

AB - Concussion, or mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), is one of the most complex clinical phenomena, as is reflected by long-standing debate over both the defining aspects of the condition and the best methods of clinical management. Since the 1980s, the sports arena has provided a natural laboratory for examining the nature and consequences of mild head injury and, in the process, has revealed a variety of circumstances and characteristics that are unique to sports-related concussion and its management. In this chapter, we describe the basic and clinical science of concussion, its epidemiology and underlying pathophysiology, and some of the controversy associated with the identification and definition of this injury. We then discuss the unique characteristics of sports-related mTBI and review the current methods for clinical management and treatment of sports-related concussions.

AB - Mental toughness is critical for achieving athletic success (Loehr, 1994) and appears to be developed through experience (Jones, Hanton, & Connaughton, 2007). The purpose of this study was to examine whether the mental toughness abilities of high school wrestlers change over a competitive season and to empirically examine potential relationships with age, experience, and success. High school male wrestlers (N = 54) completed the Mental, Emotional, and Bodily Toughness Inventory (MeBTough) at the beginning and end of a competitive wrestling season. The MeBTough is a self-report measure of mental toughness with some initial validity evidence but additional validity support is needed (Mack & Ragan, 2008). A paired-sample t-test found no significant difference between pre-test and post-test MeBTough scores. Pearson correlation results indicated that mental toughness was positively related to age and season winning percentage, but not wrestling experience or practice time. Significant differences in mental toughness abilities were found between freshmen and seniors as well as between wrestlers with winning and losing records. Based on the results, mental toughness appears to be a psychological skill that is positively associated with competitive success and takes years to develop. Thus, coaches should try to maximize the number of opportunities and experiences available for the development of mental toughness throughout an athlete's participation in sport. Additional research examining mental toughness and the validity of the MeBTough inventory is warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - This study examined the moderating role of sports participation in the concurrent and longitudinal links of peer victimization with depressive symptoms and externalizing problems. The sample consisted of 1250 participants assessed between ages 7 and 10 years. Children’s levels of peer victimization, depressive symptoms and externalizing problems were assessed by teachers. Mothers reported on children’s sports participation. Regression analyses revealed that victimized children who often participated in team sports at age 8 years displayed significantly fewer depressive symptoms concurrently compared to victims who rarely participated in such activities. Participation in team sports also counteracted (via a main effect) the longitudinal effect of victimization on depression symptoms two years later. Moreover, victimized children who often participated in team sports showed significantly fewer externalizing problems at age 10 compared to children who rarely participated in such activities. This moderating effect of team sports was partly mediated by a decrease in victimization at age 10. Specifically, victimized children who were part of a sporting team at age 8 were less victimized two years later, which accounted for part of the decrease in externalizing problems at age 10. Similar benefits were not apparent when victimized children participated in individual sports. These results suggest that sports participation may be beneficial in regard to several aspects of development, specifically for children who suffer from peer victimization. However, potential benefits may vary depending on the type of sports played. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - Comments on an article The London 2012 Olympics—Will there be a legacy for mental health? by A. Currie (2012). It is clear from the article by Currie that we are all agreed on one thing: that sport is good. Whether this be in the context of promoting physical activity in the general population as part of an Olympic legacy pledge, or as a means of battling the social exclusion that many people with mental illness experience. We are currently riding on the crest of an Olympic-induced wave. But what has impressed me most is the way in which the Paralympic Games have been promoted. We have heard stories of athletes who have endured great personal tragedy, but have managed to turn their experience into success. The positive way in which such awe-inspiring individuals have been presented has captured the public’s imagination. This should serve as a beacon of hope to mental health professionals who are determined to challenge the stigma which our service users experience. It is our duty to find equally effective ways of presenting their life stories in such a positive light, with the hope that this will help in the battle against mental health stigma.

AB - Purpose: To characterize noncombat injury/illness, determine changes in physical fitness, and evaluate the influence of these changes on medical resource utilization by National Guard (NG) Soldiers. Methods: Fiftyfour Soldiers from the Arizona NG completed pre- and postdeployment fitness testing. Additionally, individual deployment medical records were inventoried. Results: The majority of noncombat-related medical visits (41%) were musculoskeletal in nature, followed by miscellaneous (33%) and respiratory (13%). Soldiers experienced significant decreases in percent fat mass (−11.1%, p < 0.001) and VO2 peak (−10.8%, p < 0.001). There were significant increases in push-ups (16.4%, p < 0.001), sit-ups (11.0%, p = 0.001), bench-press (10.2%, p < 0.001), and back squat (14.2%, p < 0.001) measures. VO2 peak was inversely correlated to medical resource utilization ( r = −0.45 to −0.28, p ≤ 0.05). The tertile of Soldiers experiencing the sharpest declines in VO2 peak had significantly more medical visits over the course of the deployment than the other two tertiles (8.0 vs. 2.6 vs. 3.1 medical visits/Soldier, p £ 0.05). Conclusion: The predominate noncombat medical issue was musculoskeletal injury. NG Soldiers improved their body composition, strength, and endurance but experienced significant declines in aerobic fitness while deployed. These data document the association between declining aerobic fitness and increased utilization of medical resources. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - Top athletes face various challenges in their career on and off the sports field. Sport psychologists teach techniques to help athletes to cope with these challenges. Over the last 30 years, the techniques used stem mainly from psychological skills training (PST), which is influenced mainly from cognitive-behavioral theories. Recently, interest in mindfulness-based interventions has increased in sport psychology. This article identifies the limits of PST and presents theoretical considerations how mindfulness-based interventions can amend PST. Further, it addresses in what form and by what mechanisms athletes could benefit. In reviewing current mindfulness literature, we conclude that it is important to distinguish between mindfulness practice and dispositional mindfulness. Mindfulness practice means the methods through which mindfulness is fostered, whereas dispositional mindfulness describes the tendency to be mindful in everyday life. In our conceptualization, we differ between three interwoven facets of mindfulness practice (intention, attention, and attitude), which are associated with six components of dispositional mindfulness. We consider that athletes with a higher degree in mindfulness practice and dispositional mindfulness will enhance the level of several required psychological skills through various impact mechanisms. Based on theoretical considerations, we suggest bare attention, experiential acceptance, values clarifications, self-regulation/negative emotion regulation, clarity about one’s internal life, exposure, flexibility, non-attachment, and rumination as possible impact mechanisms. A greater knowledge of the conceptualization of mindfulness and its impact on psychological skills could develop and improve the effectiveness of mindfulness based interventions in sports.

AB - Touted as a multidimensional measure of mental toughness in sport, this study explored the psychometric properties of the Psychological Performance Inventory (PPI; Loehr, 1986) and its successor the Psychological Performance Inventory–A (PPI–A; Golby, Sheard, & Van Wersch, 2007). Confirmatory factor analysis was employed to examine the extent to which data collected with 333 Australian footballers aged between 15 and 18 years ( M = 16.88, SD = .71) fitted the a priori measurement models of both inventories. The results did not support the psychometric properties of the PPI both in terms of model fit and internal consistency. Although model fit data for the PPI–A were encouraging, inadequate levels of internal consistency were evidenced. Convergent validity analyses involving measures of achievement goals and global mental toughness generally supported the validity of the PPI and PPI–A subscales. Taken together with previous research (e.g., Middleton et al., 2004), caution is urged when considering the use of the PPI as a measure of mental toughness in sport. Although the empirical data were generally supportive of the psychometric properties of the PPI–A, conceptual (e.g., lack of conceptual underpinnings) and methodological (i.e., revalidated a flawed inventory) concerns become important factors when considering the PPI–A as a measure of mental toughness.

AB - In this study the authors used differential item functioning analysis to examine if there were items in the Mental, Emotional, and Bodily Toughness Inventory functioning differently across gender and athletic membership. A total of 444 male (56.3%) and female (43.7%) participants (30.9% athletes and 69.1% non-athletes) responded to the Mental, Emotional, and Bodily Toughness Inventory items. Using Mantel–Haenszel and simultaneous item bias test methods, 43 items were analyzed for differential item functioning. Four Mental, Emotional, and Bodily Toughness Inventory items were identified as large differential item functioning items by both Mantel–Haenszel and simultaneous item bias test methods, where item 21 favored non-athletes, item 40 favored athletes, item 2 favored males, and item 17 favored females. Athletic membership differential item functioning disappeared, whereas gender differential item functioning still existed at the scale level. Overall, there are gender and athletic membership differential item functioning items in the Mental, Emotional, and Bodily Toughness Inventory, but only gender differential item functioning still exists at the scale level. Thus, conclusions regarding gender differences in mental toughness should be made with caution when using total Mental, Emotional, and Bodily Toughness Inventory scores.

AB - Using the mental toughness framework of Jones, Hanton and Connaughton (2007), the authors interviewed thirteen highly-experienced swimming coaches in a two-part study to determine the specific mental toughness subcomponents present in mentally tough swimmers, and to examine the factors that led swimmers to develop mental toughness. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using methods outlined by Creswell (2007). While confirming eleven of thirteen subcomponents of mental toughness previously identified by Jones et al. (2007), the participants identified (a) “coachability” and (b) “retaining psychological control on poor training days” as previously unidentified subcomponents of mental toughness. In the second part of the study, the authors identified six higher-order themes describing how both the coach and the swimmer acted to develop mental toughness in the swimmer. Implications for researchers, swimming coaches, and sport psychology consultants are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - One of the most remarkable capacities of the mind is its ability to simulate sensations, actions, and other types of experience. A mental simulation process that has attracted recent attention from cognitive neuroscientists and sport psychologists is motor imagery or the mental rehearsal of actions without engaging in the actual physical movements involved. Research on motor imagery is important in psychology because it provides an empirical window on consciousness and movement planning, rectifies a relative neglect of non‐visual types of mental imagery, and has practical implications for skill learning and skilled performance in special populations (e.g., athletes, surgeons). Unfortunately, contemporary research on motor imagery is hampered by a variety of semantic, conceptual, and methodological issues that prevent cross‐fertilization of ideas between cognitive neuroscience and sport psychology. In this paper, we review these issues, suggest how they can be resolved, and sketch some potentially fruitful new directions for inter‐disciplinary research in motor imagery.

AB - In some occasions, sport psychologists have a long time to prepare their athletes before important competitions. In other instances, the time to work with mental skills might be short. This article shares some of the experiences that two sport psychologists had during their work with Olympic and Paralympic athletes before and during the Olympic Games (2010) in Vancouver, Canada. In particular, the authors will share some of the potentials and pitfalls that both long- and short-term involvement by the sport psychologist might instigate. In short, there are both negative and positive aspects of having a long or short time during the preparation phase. However, we highlight that we prefer to work with athletes over several seasons, because the sport psychologist then has time to see the athletes in action and to help the athletes develop the necessary skills before important competitions.

AB - Changes that occur in technology and the internet have a strong influence upon the provision of teaching, research and practice within the field of sport and exercise psychology (SEP) and other mental health fields. These influences upon SEP are made even more dramatic given the rate of change in these evolving technologies. The purpose of the current research project was to better understand how SEP practitioners (members of the Association for Applied Sport Psychology) utilize the internet in their teaching, research and practice. Participants (N = 292) completed an online survey which assessed demographics, time spent using the internet, proficiency, and importance of the internet in one's professional endeavors. Further questions relate to ethical concerns related to the use of the internet in the practice of SEP. Analyses of the data revealed significant differences between students and professionals, certified/licensed and non-certified/non-licensed practitioners, and psychology and physical education professionals with regard to their use of, perceived competence with, and ethical concern for using the internet in teaching research and service.

AB - Psychological resilience appears to provide a degree of inoculation against some of the most difficult mental health issues currently plaguing the U.S. military. However, the mechanisms which fuel resilience are relatively unexplored. This study explored the hypothesis that perceived psychological resilience mediates the relationship between various sport-related psychological skills and indicators of PTSD. The sample was 351 Stryker Brigade soldiers who had at least one previous combat deployment. Results showed that perceived psychological resilience fully mediates the relationship between three sport-related psychological skill factors and indicators of PTSD. These results suggest that sport-related psychological skills may play a role in the development of perceived psychological resilience, which in turn, influences PTSD.

AB - In a highly mediated world, iconic sporting moments are repeatedly relived, with their significance reinforced by a series of media montages. These narratives form the basis of a series of collective, shared memories within a society. Despite the power that collective memories may have, iconic sporting moments may also have private significance for an individual. In this paper, we examine these, what might be termed “mental postcards.” The study was conducted within the West Midlands of the UK, with participants asked to identify their most memorable moment as a spectator of sport. Though respondents’ accounts were idiosyncratic, highly individualized, and covered a range of sports, thematic coding revealed four specific themes: “What a Hero,” “Never Say Die,” “Being There,” and “We Won.” (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - The purpose of this study was to examine the mediational effect of perceived affective self-regulatory efficacy on the relationship between youth sport participants' perceived caring climate and their mental well-being. Three hundred and 95 participants (mean age = 11.80 ± 1.54 years) from a National Youth Sport Program were recruited for the study. Participants completed a battery of questionnaires including demographic information, the Caring Climate Scale, the Affective Self-Regulatory Efficacy measure, and measures of psychological well-being (i.e., depression, hope, sadness, and happiness). Results from the structural equation model analysis of the proposed mediational model revealed that both positive and negative affective self-regulatory efficacy mediated the relationship between the perceived caring climate and mental well-being. Findings from this study call attention to the importance of creating a caring climate in youth sport programs to foster positive mental well-being in young athletes via their affective self-regulatory efficacy.

AB - This study represents an interdisciplinary endeavor between the fields of sport psychology and the psychological study of men and masculinity. The purpose of this study was to provide a greater understanding of the relationship between traditional masculine norms and help-seeking attitudes within the unique context of football. We examined conformity to masculine norms and help-seeking stigma within a sample of 245 college football players. Cluster analytic methods were used to create a profile of participants' conformity to traditional masculine norms (i.e., clusters), then we evaluated those clusters in relation to stigma toward seeking professional psychological help. Results indicated the presence of three clusters, each of which presented unique combinations of conformity to masculine norms: a) Non-Conforming Players; b) Paradoxical Competitors; and c) Highly Conforming Players. Members of the Highly Conforming Players and Paradoxical Competitors clusters reported significantly higher levels of stigma toward help-seeking than members of the Non-Conforming Players cluster. Results provided insight into the relationship between masculinity socialization and the stigmatization of help-seeking within sport. Psychologists can use the results of this study to design interventions to help athletes identify messages of masculinity operating within sport and encourage student-athletes to ask for help so they can better maximize their success on and off the field.

AB - Applied sport psychology consultations can provide beneficial services to athletes and coaches, particularly regarding performance enhancement. This study examined the experiences of ten wrestlers involved in a long-term sport psychology program through the use of in-depth interviews. Grounded Theory methodology guided the analysis of the data which led to the creation of five main themes: Athlete Characteristics; Intervention Characteristics; Outcomes; Social Processes; and Sport Psychologist. Participants acknowledged their initial resistance to working with a female sport psychologist, based on gender stereotypes and fears of being negatively perceived by other members of the team. Issues around physical attraction and the degree to which a female could be seen as knowledgeable in a male-dominated sport impacted the consultation until services were ended. However, the social hierarchies that at one time prevented athletes from exploring these services eventually helped the team redefine what actions were considered acceptable. Participants developed an understanding of how sport psychology could help them achieve their athletic goals. They emphasized that having a sport psychologist who was at their “disposal” (highly available) and did not require them to censure their behavior or language contributed greatly to the establishment of trust. They also discussed many ways in which they felt that sport psychology had unexpectedly contributed to their lives within and beyond sport; for example, many felt more connected with their teammates after attending team talks. Finally, most participants believed that the most significant outcome of working with a sport psychologist was that of gaining a friend and positive support.

AB - College student-athletes lead a unique lifestyle in which they must manage high athletic involvement and performance demands along with traditional expectations of college students. They are expected to appropriately execute athletic and academic roles and perform at high standards in both. About half of these student-athletes will suffer an injury over the course of their college career. Injury may elicit psychological distress and can threaten the athletic identity of the athletes. They are expected to continue to maintain both their athlete and student identities at pre-injury level while working through the injury, often with relatively little support. While physical support helps the injury heal, psychological support has been shown to aid in the adjustment in activity and identity during the rehabilitation process while managing the demands of the student-athlete lifestyle. The current research is aimed at better understanding the awareness of student-athletes of availability of psychological resources, specifically sport psychology resources, and the factors that make student-athletes more likely to express interest in access to sport psychology services when recovering from injury. The research found that student-athletes are generally unaware of whether or not they have access to sport psychology services and that gender and the experience of psychological distress following injury affect interest in access to sport psychology services. The findings support the need for an increase in education of student-athletes about these services and their availability within college settings.

AB - The Olympic Games are now characterized by overt displays of military personnel and hardware, the deployment of new surveillance technologies and policing techniques, and rapidly escalating budgets. Yet, most research on security at these urban events has been confined to the sociology of sport or the applied profession of sport management. This dissertation contextualizes the Olympic Games within current debates about security in the post-9/11 environment, and asks what the Games reveal about developments in security, surveillance, and urban governance. At the same time I also ask how the Olympics reinforce and extend these developments in socio-cultural ways. These questions are pursued through four analyses of different aspects of the Games: practices of socio-spatial regulation in Olympic host cities, ideas of resiliency and preparedness in urban governance, the performative dimensions of precautionary governance, and the production and globalization of security expertise. I conclude by suggesting that the Olympics provide a window into future directions in urban security governance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Recovering from a sport injury can be physically and emotionally challenging for an adolescent athlete. Previous research indicates elevated levels of anxiety, stress, and depression following sport injuries. Providing effective social support following a sport injury has been found to influence an athletes' ability to cope with the experience of being injured and assist in rehabilitation adherence. The aim of the present investigation was to examine emotional disturbance following a sport injury in the adolescent population and determine the effects of social support provided by e-mentoring. The first phase of the research involved a descriptive data analysis to assess emotional disturbance of adolescent athletes ( n =9) sustaining an injury preventing sport participation for six weeks or greater. The Center of Epidemiological Studies on Depression (CES-D) and The Incredibly Short Profile of Mood States (IS-POMS) were administered and analyzed for elevated symptoms of emotional disturbance. The second phase of the research was an examination of social support provided by an e-mentor, a college age athlete with prior experience of a similar injury. Randomly selected participants ( n =4) were assigned an e-mentor for a six week rehabilitation phase of recovery. Three specific questions involving e-mentoring as social support were evaluated: (1) Do injured athletes demonstrate an increased positive awareness of injury rehabilitation and understanding of the injury with e-mentoring? Analysis of e-mentoring conversations indicated the adolescent injured athletes developed a greater awareness of their injury, the rehabilitation process, and the ability to share the physical experience. (2) Does e-mentoring influence emotional disturbance following a sport injury? Not all injured participants suffered emotional disturbance indicated through descriptive data analysis. However, examination of e-mentoring conversations indicated emotional support was provided from the e-mentor relationships. (3) Can the e-mentoring process provide a social support validating the injury and offer a positive experience? This investigation indicates e-mentoring provided physical, emotional and psychological support during a six week rehabilitation phase of an injury. Each injured athlete's interpretation and follow-up responses from the study suggest e-mentoring was a positive social support. Results from this research will raise awareness of emotional disturbance by an adolescent athlete following an injury and the manner in which social support can influence injury knowledge and rehabilitation adherence. The implications of e-mentoring suggest positive social support from an e-mentor can influence the physical, emotional and psychological well–being of an injured athlete affecting emotional recovery following a sport injury.

AB - Relations among body size, stress coping strategies, and mental health were examined in female high-school gymnasts (n = 44) and basketball players (n = 105), aged 14-18 years (M = 15.8, SD = 1.1), through hierarchical regression analyses. Athletes completed the Revised Ways of Coping Checklist prior to the season and the Mental Health Inventory at the end of the season. Body mass index (BMI) was also calculated. The use of adaptive over maladaptive coping strategies was associated with more positive mental health and less distress in both sports. In gymnasts, BMI was inversely related to psychological well-being and the interaction between height and less adaptive coping strategies significantly predicted psychological distress.

AB - Although mental imagery has been shown to have beneficial effects on performance, imagery has been shown to negatively affect physical performances under some conditions. The limited strength model of self-regulation posits that self-control strength is depleted when people regulate their thoughts, impulses, emotions, and behaviours. Research shows depletion of self-control strength in one task domain (e.g., controlling thoughts or images) leads to poorer self-control within similar and dissimilar domains (e.g., controlling physical endurance). The purpose of the present study was to investigate the aftereffects of performing mental imagery on two self-control tasks, physical endurance and response inhibition. Sedentary undergraduates (N = 37) were randomly assigned to either an imagery condition (n = 15), attention-placebo condition (n = 13), or a quiet rest control (n = 9). Participants performed two isometric endurance tasks (30% of maximum handgrip squeeze) separated by their respective study manipulation, and followed by the Wisconsin Card Sort Test (WCST). It was expected that participants in the mental imagery condition would show greater decrements in performance on the second endurance trial (when compared to baseline) and more perseverative errors on the WCST compared to the control conditions. All of the participants’ endurance performances declined over time (p .05) or on WCST scores (p > .05). Performing a basic 6 minute imagery session involving moderately-intense aerobic exercise does not appear to deplete self-control resources when compared to the attention-placebo and quiet rest control groups. However, the unanticipated decline in the endurance performances observed within the control conditions suggests that future research is needed to better understand the relationship between mental imagery and self-control depletion effects.

AB - This experiment investigated the relationship between mental rotation and sport training. Undergraduate university students (n = 62) completed the Mental Rotation Test (Vandenberg & Kuse, 1978), before and after a 10-month training in two different sports, which either involved extensive mental rotation ability (wrestling group) or did not (running group). Both groups showed comparable results in the pretest, but the wrestling group outperformed the running group in the posttest. As expected from previous studies, males outperformed women in the pretest and the posttest. Besides, self-reported data gathered after both sessions indicated an increase in adaptive strategies following training in wrestling, but not subsequent to training in running. These findings demonstrate the significant effect of training in particular sports on mental rotation performance, thus showing consistency with the notion of cognitive plasticity induced from motor training involving manipulation of spatial representations. They are discussed within an embodied cognition framework. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - Objectives: This paper sought to determine the psychological characteristics and skills that are fundamental to batting success in the sport of cricket. Design and method: Following on from the findings of an earlier qualitative investigation which suggested that a favourable mix of psychological attributes and skills are critical to high performance in batting (Weissensteiner et al.10), adult-aged batsmen of two different skill levels (highly skilled n = 11; lesser skilled n = 10) completed a battery of psychological tests that included measures of mental toughness (Mental Toughness Inventory), perfectionism (Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale), coping ability (Athletic Coping Skills Inventory-28), and optimism (Attributional Styles Questionnaire). Results: Contrary to the research hypothesis, it was found that the highly skilled batsmen were only distinguishable from batsmen of lesser skill by their higher degree of global mental toughness. The skilled batsmen scored significantly higher on mental toughness dimensions relating to motivation (Personal Bests, Task Value and Commitment), coping skill (Perseverance) and self-belief (Potential). Conclusions: If mental toughness can be reliably predicted at an earlier age, it may be an attribute worthy of inclusion in future talent identification and development programs.

AB - Given the concern with the practice of healthy sport activities, the aim of this study is to find what levels of eudaimonic psychological well-being (Ryff, 1989a) and general health, related with their perceived autonomy, and their record of sports injuries in 85 football players in Mexico. We used the Escala de Bienestar Psicológico , EBP. Diaz et al., 2006 to measure psychological well-being. Perceived autonomy was assessed by the Escala de Autonomia Percibida en el Deporte (Balaguer, Castillo and Duda, 2008) and general and emotional health by the Spanish version (Sanchez and Dresch, 2008) of the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12, Goldberg and Hillier, 1979). Also, records of injuries were assessed using an ad hoc questionnaire derived from the Global psychological model of sports injuries (Olmedilla and Garcia-Mas, 2009). The results show that players have a bad perception of general and emotional health, but have good levels of psychological well-being in relation to their perceived autonomy. The number of injuries -not their duration- is related to their poor perception of general and emotional health while it is negatively related to the volitional aspect of perceived autonomy. Their injuries are seen to be frequently associated with pre-competitive anxiety and stress. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - Mental practice—the methodically repeated imagination of a course of movement—is a central topic of research in sports psychology. It is applied both in high-performance sports and in rehabilitation to optimize movements. One explanation of the training effects is offered by simulation theory with its central postulate that motor imagery and movement execution activate similar neuronal structures (functional equivalence). Several neurophysiological methods have been used to prove this assumption, but the results are still inconclusive. In our opinion, electroencephalography (EEG) is conducive to the improvement of the theoretical process of understanding. This review surveys current findings concerning mental practice by means of EEG. We present three main benefits of using EEG: (a) it offers measurements of neuropsychological activity with high time resolution, (b) technical developments (wireless hardware, portable equipment) provide the mobility necessary for its application in the domain of sports, and (c) within rehabilitation, the imagination of movements can serve as a mental strategy to control neural prosthesis through brain activity.

AB - This book is comprised of seven chapters which center upon Psychological Skills Training (PST) for various sports and athletes. This book consists of twenty case studies which greatly facilitate the translation of psychological theory into everyday practice. There are numerous examples involving famous elite athletes, including those competing in European, World Championships, and Olympic medalists. The real-life examples cut across individual and team sports from 13 disciplines. In addition, psychological work with athletes with disability and sport injuries, as well as with youth athletes, is discussed. Chapter 1 focuses on the principles and foundations of our approach, and provides suggestions for the integration and implications of PST programs in the athletic training process. Chapter 2 is devoted to an analysis of PST in combat sports (judo, taekwondo, and fencing). The PST programs are based on the periodization principle last for long- or short-term periods, and are provided in a systematic/non-systematic manner. Chapter 3 is concerned with PST programs from individual sports such as rhythmic gymnastics, windsurfing, swimming, pole vault, and kayaking. Psychological programs are based on the periodization principle, focusing on both laboratory and training settings, and discuss the importance of full cooperation with the coaching staff. Chapter 4 describes PST programs for the team sports of soccer and basketball, at both the professional and youth levels. Psychological work is applied in individual and group settings, and the significant impact of full cooperation with the coaching staff, parents, and pedagogical staff in sport academia is emphasized. Chapter 5 is concerned with PST programs for youth athletes from tennis, table tennis, judo, and basketball. Special attention is given to the relationship between the sport psychology consultant, coach, and parents. Chapter 6 focuses on three case studies from judo, table tennis, and sailing 470 for athletes with disability or sport injuries. The major idea of PST programs is the modification and development of psychological interventions suitable to the athletes' disability and injuries. Finally, Chapter 7 presents seven main points which are the basis for our psychological intervention approach. We demonstrate that the implementation of these central points in the training process has a major positive impact on athletic performance enhancement.

AB - Pacing in Sport and Exercise: A Psychophysiological Perspective is a book which comprehensively examines the way humans pace exercise and sporting activities. Research on pacing has been dominated by physiological investigations despite the acknowledgement by many authors on the interdisciplinary nature of pacing. Therefore, we consider both physiological and psychological influences on pacing, before developing an interdisciplinary perspective. This approach explains metabolic regulation during exercise and also facilitates the development of a practical (self-regulatory) means with which to optimise training. Chapter one of this book provides an overview of the factors associated with the evolutionary development of human athletic performance. It presents a historical view on human training and conditioning perspectives and also on methods including the use of linear and non-linear periodization systems. Chapter two introduces the concept of pacing in sport and exercise. We define pacing as 'the goal directed distribution and management of effort across the duration of an exercise bout'. Evidence from both animal and human studies is presented to illustrate the way species adapt behaviour to contextual and personal constraints and pace activities accordingly. A guiding principle is to see pacing as a neural buffering process preventing premature physical exhaustion. In chapter three, both physical and psychological limitations to human performance are discussed. Limitations of traditional physiological models and also the contemporary central governor model of metabolic control are outlined. We propose a new 'conscious brain regulation' model as a variation to the central govenor model, which provides a simpler but more comprehensive explanation of the many phenomena associated with pacing and fatigue in sport and exercise from a psychophysiological perspective. In chapter four, self-regulatory systems for developing skills and also for monitoring training outcomes are identified and discussed. In particular, the rate of perceived exertion for monitoring training is suggested as a practical way of both setting and monitoring training across all modes of exercise. The facilitating and debilitating role of psychological factors like mental toughness, coping strategies and self-confidence are also discussed. Pacing in relation to endurance activities is explored in chapter five. Although the role of pacing may not be intuitively apparent for power, strength and speed events, in chapter six we provide the reader with information on the relevance of appropriate pacing strategies across anaerobic events. High intensity activities might also benefit from preparatory strategies to control arousal levels or expectancies. This chapter also contains a self-paced system and practical example for training in power, strength and speed activities. In chapter seven, pacing for team (invasion-type) sports is discussed. Most team sports are intermittent in nature requiring utilization of both aerobic and anaerobic energy systems. Pacing strategies are apparent in team games, yet are more complex as energetic demands vary by position and the game situation. A multi-level pacing model is discussed based on observations in soccer, yet which is applicable to all invasion games. A practical example of self-regulatory training for team sports is provided. Finally, in chapter eight we outline a number of situations in which self-regulation of exercise might need to be accompanied by other extrinsic (support) techniques. For example, accuracy of self-perception is less developed in children because of their inexperience and can also be distorted among all individuals when homeostasis is compromised by illness or medication. The regulation of exercise behaviour in children, in individuals with Multiple Sclerosis and the obese are examined. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)(preface)

AB - Although sport is played with the body, it is won in the mind. Inspired by this idea, the second edition of this successful textbook provides a comprehensive critical introduction to sport and exercise psychology - a discipline that is concerned with the theory and practice of helping athletes to do their best when it matters the most. The book is organized into four parts: Part one investigates the nature, foundations and current status of the discipline. Part two reviews the latest research findings on motivation, anxiety, concentration, mental imagery and expertise in athletes. Part three examines group processes and team dynamics. Part four explores exercise behaviour and the psychology of injury rehabilitation. Each chapter contains specially designed critical thinking exercises to encourage students to explore the deeper issues, and also features an invaluable list of suggestions for independent research projects by students. The text has been extensively rewritten and updated with new material to take account of hot topics such as neuroscience and motor imagery, as well as issues such as "grunting" in tennis, the psychology of penalty shootouts, mindfulness training as a concentration technique, the effects of music on physical activity, and "exergaming" - the use of computer games to increase physical activity/exercise. Written in a lively, accessible style, the book is brimful of vivid contemporary examples and insights from the world's leading athletes, to provide a compelling bridge between theory and practice for undergraduate and postgraduate students of sport psychology, health psychology, sport science, physical education, kinesiology and leisure management.

The purpose of Chapter 1, "The Sport Training Process: Psychological Perspectives," is to describe different elements of the athletic training program, as well as various preparations via the concept of periodization. Psychological preparation is discussed in terms of its role as an integral part of the sport training program. Chapter 2, "Psychological Factors Associated with High Performance," describes mental aspects related to peak performance. The psychological skills required for the best athletic execution in various sports are discussed. Finally, in Chapter 3, "Developing Psychological Skills: A Three-dimensional approach," we present an innovative psychological skills training program that is based on our personal consulting experience. The approach is composed of three dimensions: Learning, Modification, and Application. Using real examples, we demonstrate the internal structure of psychological skills training as used by athletes at all skill levels.

AB - Many years ago coaches and sport psychologist advocated the use of mental imagery almost to the point of exclusion of other sport psychology skills. The mantra of "What you see is what you get" permeated sport psychology research and application. Having spent over 30 years looking at the psychophysiological processes of athletes, the first author found this statement simplistic and misleading and would retort "What you see is not all there is." Fortunately, today's researchers and many clinicians appreciate the complexity of imagery and are developing models, programs and instrumentation that will hopefully improve the quality and the effectiveness of using mental imagery in sport. The first purpose of this chapter is to highlight some of the issues and complexities of current imagery research in cognitive psychology and neuroscience through a representation of the literature. Additionally, while there are many books, research and application articles on imagery to attest to its popularity and complexity, almost all of these are based on self-report. Since no research has been found that has tested the use of neurofeedback (NF) for training imagery for athletes, our second purpose is to provide guidelines for this training. However, the reader is cautioned to view our suggestions on how quantitative electroencephalography is used in our assessment and mental training paradigm with athletes as preliminary. The investigation and application of NF training for imagery in athletes has just begun. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)

AB - This story took place in 2003-2004 in Wingate Institute, Israel, with one of our best Judoka. There are a few reasons for choosing Judo as our case study for this chapter. Biofeedback training, which involves an electronic monitoring device and provides immediately visual and auditory feedback of physiological responses, has been suitable for athletes and can improve their mental skills such as relaxation, self-regulation, and self-confidence. From 1991 our research team focused on using biofeedback methods in numerous individual and team sports (e.g. Judo, swimming, windsurfing, rhythmic gymnastics, soccer, basketball). The research and the applied work with athletes led to the development of the Wingate 5-Steps Approach (W5SA) which includes Self-Regulation Test (SRT) and five steps to mental preparation with biofeedback (i.e. Introduction, Identification, Simulation, Transformation, Realization). This approach has been documented in numerous books and articles. Today, our consultant team has been developed integration between the W5SA and other intervention techniques such as imagery, relaxation, positive thinking, reaction training programs, and the implications of these complex strategies to athletic training. This relationship will be illustrated in our case study which will focus on a one-year work with one of the best Judoka athlete in Israel.

The sport we chose for this case is windsurfing, a very popular sport in Israel. This case study describes one of the first attempts in our country where psychological preparation, including biofeedback training, was used in windsurfing. We will discuss our work with one of the best world windsurfer from an educational point of view, in which we focus on his mental and emotional aspects of performance enhancement.

AB - To help provide an understanding of measurement methods addressing mental representation in motor action, this chapter begins by establishing a model that places mental representation in a functional relationship to motor action. Mental representations are characterized by well-integrated networks of basic action concepts (BACs). Each BAC corresponds to functionally meaningful body postures and movement elements. Next, this chapter considers relevant issues in research methodology and presents a method for the experimental assessment of mental representation structures. Because rating and sorting methods do not allow a psychometric analysis of the representational structure, a methodical procedure called structural dimensional analysis of mental representation (SDA-M) is applied. The SDA-M contains four steps: (1) A special split procedure involving a multiple sorting task is used to create a distance scaling among the BACs of a suitably predetermined set. (2) A hierarchical cluster analysis is used to transform the set of BACs into a hierarchical structure. (3) A factor analysis is used to reveal the dimensions in this structured set of BACs. (4) The cluster solutions are tested for invariance within and between individuals and groups. A practical implication of the measurement of mental representations with SDA-M arises from the fact that the measured representation structures can be analyzed not only on a group level but also on an individual level. Empirical studies using this method in sport, dance, and rehabilitation are used to demonstrate the procedure of the SDA-M method and to discuss the opportunities this method opens for research and practical work.

AB - More than a decade ago, McAuley and Mihalko (1998) critically reviewed the extant literature on the measurement of exercise-related self-efficacy. They made the case that physical activity is both an important health behavior implicated in physical and psychological health and a notoriously difficult behavior for people to adopt and maintain over the long term. Little has changed in this regard. Physical activity is still associated with disease reductions (Laaksonen et al, 2005; Lee, 2003; Sesso, Paffenbarger, & Lee, 2000) and psychological health (Brown et al, 2003; Fox, 1999), and participation remains abysmally poor (Haskell & Lee, 2007). This chapter updates the McAuley and Mihalko (1998) review by using more stringent inclusion criteria to review 488 articles in which self-efficacy was used as a correlate of physical activity behavior. We begin with a brief overview of social cognitive theory (SCT) and the role of self-efficacy within this theoretical framework. Next, we classify the efficacy measures that are most consistently used in the literature into the three dimensions of (1) barriers self-efficacy, (2) task-specific self-efficacy, and (3) adherence self-efficacy. We discuss the psychometric properties of these measures and give an overview of how each class of efficacy measures has been demonstrated to relate to physical activity and associated outcomes. We conclude with recommendations for both the research and the practice communities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)

AB - The mental or psychological skills of athletes have always been of interest to practitioners and researchers alike. Especially when athletes have reached high levels of performance and have perfected the technical aspects of the sport (e.g., professional and Olympic athletes), the difference between good and great performance and winning and losing is often due to mental skills (Orlick & Partington, 1988). There is little doubt from a practical point of view that mental skills are critical to the success of athletes. Thus, a question that has interested researchers is the notion of the ability of athletes to learn these mental skills. The process of athletes learning these different self-regulatory skills (e.g., imagery, relaxation, goal setting, self-talk) has become known as psychological skills training (PST). Weinberg and Gould (2007) defined PST as "systematic and consistent practice of mental or psychological skills for the purpose of enhancing performance, increasing enjoyment, or achieving greater sport and physical activity self-satisfaction". This chapter discusses psychological skill assessment and measurement, and the history, theoretical foundations, and current issues of PST.

AB - Mental health professionals are, by and large, nice people. We like to help—that's at least part of the reason we're in this business. Put that together with the fact that a large proportion of the population is in sports and physical activity. And sport psychology is becoming so popular now. Conclusion? Maybe there's a niche market just waiting for you. You, too, could become a good sport. . . psychologist. Is it as simple as tacking on a modifier to your professional title? Tempting as that might be, of course, the answer is a resounding "no." Nonetheless, sport psychology offers varied practice opportunities (Novotney, 2008) as well as interesting information relating to both content and practice. Learning and practicing in this field can be fun and energizing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)

AB - The aim of the current study was to extend previous research by Holland and colleagues (2010) into the required psychological qualities of young talented rugby players by considering the perceptions and supportive role of influential others. Perceptions of players’ parents ( n = 17), coaches ( n = 7), and sport administration staff (SAS; n = 2) were explored through focus group discussions. Findings show that these influential others considered the same 11 higher order themes for psychological qualities previously identified as desirable by players. Their views on how they assisted in developing these player psychological qualities were classified into three higher-order themes, namely progressive development, professional environment, and performance environment. Specific behaviors contributing to each context and deemed helpful by influential others were discussed in terms of ecological systems theory (Bonfenbrenner, 1977). Recommendations for future research and applied implications for consultants are subsequently offered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - The study examined the effect of an evidence-based intervention on choking in golf. It is informed by the work of Hill, Hanton, Matthews and Fleming (2010a) that explored the experiences of elite golfers who either choked or excelled under pressure. The perceptions of elite golf coaches who worked with both ‘chokers’ and those who excelled, were also considered. It revealed that choking may be alleviated through the use of process goals, cognitive restructuring, imagery, simulated training and a pre/postshot routine. The present study incorporated each strategy into an intervention that was introduced to two professional golfers (aged 22) who choked under pressure regularly. Through an action research framework the impact of the intervention was evaluated over a ten month period via qualitative methods. The results indicated the intervention alleviated the participants’ choking episodes and so provides information that can be of use to practitioners working with golfers who choke.

In the past 20 years there has been a multitude of applied sport psychology books published. Inside Sport Psychology falls into the first category, meaning that general sport psychology concepts and principles are discussed, and it is up to the reader to translate and apply that information to their own specific performance situation. This book is written for athletes, coaches, team managers, parents, and students of sport psychology who recognize the importance of mental training but lack an understanding of how psychology and performance blend. There are eight chapters included in the book, six of which are typically found in most applied sport psychology books. The strengths of the book far outweigh the weaknesses, and I would recommend the book for two basic reasons. First for its innovative discussions on the psychology of skill acquisition and the use of music to enhance performance; and second for the numerous application exercises that can be used by most readers regardless of skill level and sport.

AB - Reviews the book, Focused for Soccer: Winning the Mental Game (2nd Ed.) by Bill Beswick (see record 2010-12624-000). In this book, Bill Beswick provides an in-depth discussion of the mental demands of soccer as well as helpful suggestions for integrating mental components of the game with technical and tactical aspects. The book contains twelve chapters devoted primarily to the assessment and development of players’ mental skills. The primary focus of most assessment activities is to ensure that “players begin to understand their individual strengths and weaknesses and learn more about themselves”. Throughout the book, Beswick’s discussion of concepts is supplemented with bulleted summaries and checklists that promote ease of comprehension. He also includes supporting references from the scholarly sport psychology literature and provides anecdotes and examples from his own coaching and consulting experiences. While this book is directed towards soccer coaches and sport psychology practitioners, the language and flow of discussion is easy to understand for individuals who may not be familiar with the sport’s culture or terminology. The author’s promotion of player ownership and accountability for mental training through self-assessment and ongoing mental skill development is a particular strength of the book.

AB - Professional athletes are subject to massive somatic, social, and mental stress. Despite great public interest for athletic achievements, the emotional strains thereof are very poorly investigated and discussed. The main reason for this is the widespread assumption that only emotionally very strong athletes are able to compete at the highly professional level and therefore mental disorders do not exist in professional sports. But available research data about the prevalence of mental disorders in this area suggest that this hypothesis must be revised. With respect to depression and the overtraining syndrome, attempts have been made to demonstrate the difficulties with etiology, diagnostics, and treatment for sports psychiatry and psychotherapy. Scientifically, sport psychiatry and psychotherapy can be defined as a discipline, whose focus is the investigation, treatment, and prevention of the extreme and sports-specific emotional strains and disorders. In addition to sport psychology, which focuses mainly on performance enhancement, mental stress, and disorders can hereby be recognized, disorders be treated and the athletic performance sustained. With the foundation of the Task Force for Sports Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the German Association for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, scientific research, further education, prevention, and treatment for mental disorders in professional sports will be improved.

AB - Experimental and brain imaging studies provide strong evidence for the involvement of motor processes in spatial ability problems, such as mental rotation tasks. This study was designed to assess the relationship between motor performance in sport and mental rotation problems solving. Elite and novice athletes in various sports completed two spatial ability tasks the Mental Rotation Test (MRT Vandenberg & Kuse, 1978) and the Movement Imagery Specific Test (MIST), sport specific training and MRT results (experiments 1 & 2 Moreau, Clerc, Mansy-Dannay, Guerrien, 2010). If motor processes are decisive in spatial ability tasks, we should find differences favoring individuals involved in activities that require complex motor skills. Interestingly, we found a significant relationship between sports performance, activity, sport-specific training and MRT results (experiment 1 & 2). In addition, the well-documented gender effect on the MRT was confirmed (experiments 1 & 2). Results also underlined that elite athletes gained efficiency by using flexible strategies, which can be adjusted to the particular problems encountered (experiment 2). These results help fostering our understanding of the relationship between motor representations, spatial abilities and performance in sports. They are discussed in terms of their implications to general spatial ability models and to training procedures or sports advertising.

It is the purpose of this paper to discuss those aspects of sports officiating, particularly ice hockey officiating, which are, specific to officiating performance (i.e., decision making, the role of deliberate practice, conflict management, and coping). In order to facilitate the discussion, actual experiences are presented which in turn are explored theoretically, empirically, and from applied intervention perspectives. It is suggested that more holistic training programs that include video training, mental skills training, in addition to physical skills training may accelerate the path to elite ice hockey officiating.

To this end, I provide an overview of my approach to mental training consulting and how it has been significantly shaped by Lazarus's (1991, 2000a) cognitive-motivational-relational theory of emotion and current coping in sport research. I argue for the strengths of prioritizing the emotional experiences of athletes in applied sport psychology work, as well as an approach that emphasizes the development of athletes' self-awareness, the need to disentangle athletes' coping strategies from the goals underlying those strategies, and the importance of seeing athletes' emotional experiences as a process. I also encourage caring and compassionate relationships between consultants and clients that respect boundaries of professional competence. I end with a discussion of relevant ethical questions that are entwined with mental skills consulting embedded within coping in sport framework.

Emerging research has supported a variety of influences (e.g., coaches, parents, self) and mechanisms (e.g., reflecting on our experiences, coach motivational climate) by which mental toughness development likely occurs. In this article we focus on a strengths-based approach to mental toughness development, which has received scant attention within the sport psychology literature. A brief history of strengths approaches to the development of human potential is presented and contrasted with assumptions of traditional psychological skills training. We then describe how a strengths-based approach was translated into practice using an example from professional cricket. The guidelines have been shown to be effective in elite sport settings, but we believe they may also prove effective in youth sport settings.

AB - Refereeing a high-profile soccer game requires a unique blend of sports-specific knowledge, physical abilities, and mental skills. While mental skills instruction has been seen as an integral element of performance enhancement in elite sport, the application of sport psychology intervention for referees and match officials is far less prominent. This case study briefly describes the levels of stress associated with refereeing elite soccer matches and the impact of stress on officiating performance and subsequent self-confidence of soccer referees. The work then outlines the program of mental skills intervention that was delivered to an elite soccer referee working within the Scottish professional soccer leagues. The program of mental skills embraced five stages: (1) Education; (2) Assessment/profiling; (3) Mental skill learning; (4) Application of mental skills in context; and (5) Evaluation, and this article centers on the way in which each of these stages was carried out. The case study describes how the mental skills instruction program was associated with improved refereeing performance, and provides some tentative advice for sport psychology practitioners who may wish to provide consultancy services within the domain of sports officiating.

AB - Recent research has identified optimism as an underlying mechanism of mental toughness (Coulter, Mallett, & Gucciardi, 2010). To further understand what elements of mental toughness can be developed, the current study evaluated the utility of an optimism intervention that employed cognitive-behavioral techniques (e.g., identifying automatic thoughts; testing accuracy of thoughts) to retrain attributional style. Seven male rugby players who were competing in first grade club rugby participated in the intervention. The effectiveness of the program was partially evaluated via self-reports of the Sport Attributional Style Scale (Hanrahan, Grove, & Hattie, 1989). Qualitative data were also collected via a focus group and semistructured interviews. The quantitative results provided minimal support for the utility of the intervention; there was evidence to suggest participants’ attributions became more external for negative events. The qualitative data suggested that participants (a) developed greater resilience in the face of adversity, (b) were more confident in their sport, and (c) developed a more optimistic explanatory style for negative events. The qualitative findings support the utility of a cognitive-behavioral based attribution retraining intervention for developing optimism in rugby players. The data also supported the flexible use of external attributions for negative events. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

The book provides a great discussion and application of the most relevant topics in the field of sport psychology regarding athletes' mental performance and their enjoyment of sport. The book is targeted towards athletes but may also serve as a resource to coaches, sport psychology consultants, and other professionals who are working with sport performers. The authors present their ideas clearly and refrain from using language that might “turn off” those readers who are less familiar with the field of sport psychology. This book does not provide a detailed step-by-step guide for the development of an individualized mental training plan like other books such as 10-Minute Mental Toughness. This book can serve as a valuable resource for both aspiring and established sport psychology consultants who are interested in “brushing up” on vital mental training concepts and ideas.

The aim here was to investigate the possibility of an association of computers and video games or sports (team, individual) with psychiatric disorders among underage psychiatric inpatients. The series of adolescents ( n = 508) had been diagnosed using semistructured interviews (K-SADS-PL). The results showed that an interest in computers and video games did not increase the risk of any specific psychiatric disorder among these adolescent inpatients, but the likelihood of a substance-related disorder was statistically significantly lower among the boys with computers as a hobby. Team sports were related to increased likelihood of conduct disorder among the boys, whereas the likelihood of an affective disorder was reduced. No such association was found in individual sports or among the girls. We conclude that social contacts and peers play an important role in preventing adolescent depression.

AB - Although triathlon is growing in popularity at a remarkable rate, it has not been extensively studied. The aims of this research were to identify preparation strategies used by triathletes and to categorize these strategies according to gender and consultation with triathlon coaches. Survey data collected from 401 triathletes (207 males, 194 females) revealed training, nutritional, and mental preparation habits. Most participants engaged in strength training, consumed food and/or fluids during and after training, set training and competition goals, and applied mental preparation strategies during training and the hour before racing. Water was the most commonly consumed fluid; positive self-talk was the most used mental strategy. Participants were more likely to consult with a triathlon coach than a nutrition or sport psychology professional. Athletes with more years of experience in triathlon and those competing in longer distances were more likely to consult a triathlon coach. Female triathletes were more likely than male triathletes to train with others, use mental preparation strategies, and report feeling anxious before competitions. More male triathletes reported using nutritional supplements during training than their female counterparts. These findings add to the limited research base on triathletes’ training habits, and hopefully will help guide practitioners who work with this group. The results provide guidance for collaborative efforts among training, nutrition, and mental health professionals to best support triathletes.

AB - The purpose of this study was to investigate how the nationality (United States vs. Japan), race (Caucasian vs. Minority), and gender of college student athletes influenced their access and exposure to, and interest in sport psychology consultations and their perceptions of several consulting issues. Another purpose was to examine the relationship between athletes’ current and previous multicultural exposure and their preferences toward working with sport psychology consultants (SPCs) of differing backgrounds. The participants were American ( n = 271) and Japanese ( n = 302) collegiate athletes. Results revealed that Japanese athletes rated the importance of having consultants of the same gender, same race, same sport background, being knowledgeable about athlete’s culture, having experience working with diverse populations, and being close in age higher than American athletes. American athletes were more likely to seek help from family members first for both mental skills and mental health issues, and Japanese athletes were more likely to seek help from teammates first for mental skills and friends first for mental health issues before resourcing SPCs.

AB - The purpose of the present study was to explore coaches’ perceptions of mental toughness attributes as well as the strategies used to build mental toughness. Participants were 10 National Collegiate Athletic Association head coaches from a variety of sports. In-depth interviews were conducted using standard qualitative methodology and content analyzed by three researchers. Based on raw data responses, lower and then higher-order themes were developed to capture the main ideas of mental toughness discussed by coaches. Regarding mental toughness attributes, psychological skills, motivation to succeed, and resilience emerged as higher-order themes, indicating some overlapping themes with previous studies exploring attributes from athletes’ perspectives. Creating a tough physical practice environment, a positive mental environment, and providing mental toughness learning opportunities were themes that emerged as strategies coaches used to build mentally tough athletes. Findings are discussed in reference to previous literature on mental toughness and the psychology of excellence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - Objectives: The purpose of this study was to describe the psychological effects of poor coaching reported by collegiate, professional and semi-professional athletes. Design: The present study employs a qualitative research design. Existential phenomenology is a contemporary qualitative research method that seeks to describe lived experience. This research design provided the framework for understanding athletes’ effects of poor coaching. Method: Participants ( N = 16) were asked to describe their experiences of poor coaching. All responses were recorded, transcribed, and the data were analyzed through a series of iterations, which led to the identification of five themes that constitute the essence of athletes’ experiences with poor coaching. Results: The five themes derived from athletes’ reports were: poor teaching by the coach, uncaring, unfair, inhibiting athlete’s mental skills, and athlete coping. Two of these themes, inhibiting athlete’s mental skills and coping, are closely connected to psychological constructs, and are presented in this paper. The theme of inhibiting athlete’s mental skills was made up of athletes’ descriptions of poor coaches as being distracting, engendering self-doubt, demotivating, and dividing the team. The theme of athlete coping describes how athletes responded to being poorly coached. Conclusions: Researchers conclude that the two themes, inhibiting athlete’s mental skills and athlete coping, are related to several constructs in sport psychology literature such as motivation, self-efficacy, focus and concentration, team cohesion, and stress and coping. Instruction on coping skills is warranted for athletes dealing with poor coaching. Future research should also examine the relationship between coping skills and dropout in youth sport.

AB - Reviews the book, Boxing shadows by W. K. Statton (2009). This book tells the compelling story of Anissa "The Assassin" Zamarron, a two-time world champion flyweight boxer. Her biography details her mental illness and addiction, struggle to find real help, and career as a Latina boxer growing up in Texas. The first half of the book focuses on Anissa's upbringing and struggles with mental illness and addiction. Her parents separated when she was in the second grade and her two brothers, Roland and Ramon, went to live with their father while she lived with their mother in Austin, Texas. A reader does not need to have a background or understanding of the boxing subculture in order to understand and appreciate this book. As a professor teaching undergraduate and graduate courses in sport psychology and sport sociology, I believe this book could serve as an excellent supplementary resource to students, especially graduate students interested in applied sport psychology. There are many ways in which this text could be used in graduate level courses in applied sport psychology. Reading biographies and autobiographies are powerful ways to translate knowledge and Annissa's story, while difficult to read at times, is compelling and could serve as an excellent teaching resource. In reading this book, I was struck by the honesty and detail presented. Anissa's story has the potential to promote critical thinking and broaden both students and professionals' perspectives on psychological issues and the role that sport involvement can play in recovery and personal empowerment. For Anissa, boxing became her salvation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Objectives: Few epidemiological studies have focused on the psychological health of high level athletes. This study aimed to identify the principal psychological problems encountered within French high level athletes, and the variations in their prevalence based on sex and the sport practiced. Methods: Multivariate analyses were conducted on nationwide data obtained from the athletes’ yearly psychological evaluations. Results: A representative sample of 13% of the French athlete population was obtained. 17% of athletes have at least one ongoing or recent disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) being the most prevalent (6%), followed by non-specific eating disorders (4.2%). Overall, 20.2% of women had at least one psychopathology, against 15.1% in men. This female predominance applied to anxiety and eating disorders, depression, sleep problems and self-harming behaviors. The highest rates of GAD appeared in aesthetic sports (16.7% vs. 6.8% in other sports for men and 38.9% vs. 10.3% for women); the lowest prevalence was found in high risk sports athletes (3.0% vs. 3.5%). Eating disorders are most common among women in racing sports (14% vs. 9%), but for men were found mostly in combat sports (7% vs. 4.8%). Discussion: This study highlights important differences in psychopathology between male and female athletes, demonstrating that the many sex-based differences reported in the general population apply to elite athletes. While the prevalence of psychological problems is no higher than in the general population, the variations in psychopathology in different sports suggest that specific constraints could influence the development of some disorders.

AB - This article reviews recent evidence concerning the development of mental toughness in young athletes, from first involvement in sport through to early adulthood. The role and importance of genetics, environmental factors, and psychological-skills training in the development of mental toughness is discussed. In particular, environmental factors that can be manipulated and influenced by coaches and parents are emphasized to aid the transfer of knowledge from scientific research into applied practice. Of central importance is the development of independent problem-solving and personal responsibility through a challenging yet supportive learning environment. We argue that to develop mental toughness, young athletes must be gradually exposed to, rather than shielded from, demanding situations in training and competition in order to learn how to cope. Also, as athletes become more emotionally mature, they should become increasingly involved in making decisions regarding their own development. Athletes should be encouraged and supported in reflecting upon setbacks and failures that occur as a natural part of the developmental process. Negative experiences, as well as the confidence-boosting outcomes of achieving goals, provide opportunities for personal growth, and allow important lessons to be learned. Various practical suggestions are provided. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

This book describes that mental toughness is a skill that can be learned, needed for all aspects of life, and vital for anyone who is looking to live a satisfying life. Mental toughness is introduced as a factor that can make a difference between being good and being great. Author Robert Weinberg explains that mental toughness consists of four main aspects or "pillars," namely motivation, coping with pressure, concentration, and confidence. The reviewer feels that Mental Toughness for Sport, Business and Life will be a helpful resource for all individuals, including sport psychology consultants, athletes, coaches, and parents who are looking to learn more about mental toughness and how it can be learned and applied.

AB - Previous work has consistently found positive relationships between levels of sport team identification and social psychological well-being. According to the Team Identification–Social Psychological Health Model, these effects result from the increased social connections fans generate through their interest in the team. The current pair of investigations was designed to test the hypotheses that (1) team identification is positively related to social well-being and (2) team identification is positively related to social connections. In addition, the interrelationships among the variables were investigated (i.e., tests for mediation and moderation). In Study 1, a sample of 161 college students completed a questionnaire assessing demographics, identification with a local team, connections gained by following the team, and social well-being. Results indicated that, as expected, team identification was positively related to both well-being and social connections. Subsequent analyses failed to find evidence that social connections mediated or moderated the relationship between team identification and social psychological health. Study 2 ( N = 199 students from the same university as Study 1) replicated the results of the initial study using a more general measure of social connections (i.e., the Campus Connectedness Scale). Discussion includes the implications for the Team Identification–Social Psychological Health Model and the directionality between identification and social connections.

AB - Reviews the book, Mental toughness training for golf by Rob Bell (2010). The author puts forth a book aimed at enhancing a golfer’s level of mental toughness. Having a wealth of experience inside the ropes at Tour events, Dr. Bell provides a unique perspective to the mental side of golf that can be useful to both practitioners and athletes. One important message that the reader takes from this book is the notion of starting strong and finishing strong, an analogy that will resonate vividly with most golfers. The text is structured in a way that makes it possible for an individual to easily navigate the content and find tips specific to their needs. The book also incorporates practical applications throughout to provide readers with specific drills that they can do to put newly learned mental skills into practice. This is definitely one of the book’s strengths as the link between theory and practice is not always clear. In conclusion, I would recommend this book to both athletes and practitioners who wish to develop mental toughness in golf as it has the potential to significantly impact how individuals think and participate in the game.

AB - In the quest for peak performance, athletes have traditionally engaged in performance skills training as the primary intervention strategy for enhancing athletic performance. However, mindfulness and acceptance-based strategies have been gaining momentum, particularly becoming the subject of further investigation in sport psychology. The Mindfulness-Acceptance-Commitment (MAC) approach for performance enhancement is a seven-week protocol that works to enhance athletes’ nonjudgmental awareness, cultivates experiential acceptance, and improves task-focused attention so that athletes learn they can reach peak performance despite negative internal states (Gardner & Moore, 2004, 2007). This open trial study examined the efficacy of the MAC program in comparison to a matched seven-week psychological skills training program for enhancing athletic performance among 19 collegiate athletes of various sport domains. Based on analysis of variance, results indicated that the groups did not significantly differ, however athletes in the MAC group demonstrated increased mindfulness skills in their ability to describe and to be non-reactive towards their inner experience from pretest to posttest. Moreover, the MAC group demonstrated increased experiential acceptance, particularly describing an increased ability to take action towards their goals. This study provides limited support for the applicability and utility of the MAC program with collegiate athletes. Further research is necessary to better understand the performance-related attributes that may be the underlying cause to athletic performance enhancement, as well as determining the sport specific impact of the MAC program.

AB - Sport psychology, and specifically athletic performance, has been an area of interest and research since the late 19 th century. The results have led to sport psychology consultants using mental practice techniques with athletes in an attempt to increase their performance. This paper will review the literature that has been conducted on mental practice techniques, while also providing a history of sport psychology. The literature will be used to develop a new model. This model will teach athletes individual mental practice techniques, how to apply them, and finally how to integrate them with each other. The interventions that will be included are goal setting, imagery, behavioral coping strategies and cognitive coping strategies. Additionally, this program will emphasize the use of intramodal strategies, which involve using multiple mental practice techniques within one another.

AB - Research in sport psychology has identified some general reactions of collegiate student-athletes when meeting the academic requirements and sport performance demands of their institutions. Despite such awareness, limited information has been reported regarding: (a) the extent to which the day to day and longer range demands are considered as problematic and stressful for collegiate student-athletes; (b) how student-athletes cope with these situations; and (c) student-athletes’ views on being provided support in managing their role as student and athlete. In an effort to obtain a more in depth understanding of these issues, a survey was created and distributed electronically to 550 student-athletes enrolled at an NCAA Division-1 college in Pennsylvania, with data being collected and used from 231 participants. Data for the entire sample was analyzed to identify areas of sport, school, and life that respondents found stressful, along with the coping mechanisms they used in their self management as student-athletes. Data was then analyzed based on gender, year in college, and sport. Out of the fifteen items included in the survey, twelve were rated as stressful by more than half of the participants. Although many items were rated as stressful, 5 out of the 12 items received moderate to extreme stress ratings. Specifically, not meeting their own expectations and grades received the highest stress ratings followed by pressure to win, balancing sport and academic demands, and being nervous before or during competition. In order to help manage these stressors, a majority of the student-athletes reported that they spend time with friends, take a break, exercise, and ask friends and family for advice, suggesting that they utilize both problem-focused and emotion-focused coping skills. Responses from the survey were used to create a set of guidelines for athletic department personnel and other professionals working with collegiate student-athletes in an effort to increase their understanding of stress and coping and how to further proceed in learning how to balance sport and academic demands.

AB - A pre-shot routine enables athletes to focus on well rehearsed cues (Schmidt & Pepper, 1998). Pre-shot routines are commonly discussed in golf literature as well as in consultation. Research on routines is scattered; a consistent line of inquiry has not studied all three components of a pre-shot routine (e.g, cognitive, behavioral, and relaxation). Studies have begun to suggest that elite players create their own routines (Cohn, Rotella, & Lloyd, 1990); and thus routines may be particularly beneficial for youth sport performers. Lastly, the literature is still missing studies that employ sound methodological designs, comprehensive interventions teaching adequate mental skills that form a pre-shot routine and social validation of the protocol and results with youth participants. The purpose of this study was to examine the potential efficacy of a pre-shot routine on improving competitive youth golf putting and approach shot performance. The research question was will learning the psychological components (e.g. cognitive cues, behavioral focusing strategies, and relaxation) of a pre-shot routine improve approach shot and putting performance of competitive youth golfers? There were two aims that addressed this research question. The first aim was to determine the impact of learning the mental skills components of a pre-shot routine on the total number of approach shots and putts in tournaments during the competitive season. The hypothesis was that learning a pre-shot routine would result in participants becoming more consistent and/or improved sport performance (e.g, decreasing total number of approach shots and putts per round). The second aim was to examine the potential impact of learning the pre-shot routine on competitive performance from the participants' perspectives and involved them in evaluating the intervention and its impact on their competitive performance. Three youth high school golfers participated in a 10 week program to learn 3 mental skills (i.e, cue words, deep breathing, & behavioral focusing strategy) that would form a pre-shot routine. Participants' competition and practice scorecards were collected, and the total number of strokes per round were graphed and examined for performance improvements. Also, participants completed self-report surveys after each tournament round that asked them to indicate their perceived ability to focus on each hole and whether they adhered to their pre-shot routines. Lastly, participants completed interviews after learning each skill and at the end of the program to evaluate the overall intervention protocol. Performance improvements were observed for 2 participants putting and approach shot performance. Participants found the intervention to be helpful and agreed that their performances (i.e, ball striking, overall performance, iron, wood, & sand shots) improved. Practical implications for sport psychology consultants and future directions were forwarded. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Re-injury worry is an important construct in competitive sport that may influence performance and increase the risk of re-injury. However, there are currently no available instruments to measure the causes of re-injury worry. The purpose of this study was to develop the Causes of Re-Injury Worry Questionnaire (CRIWQ). The study was conducted in three independent research phases to investigate the following: (a) the content relevance, (b) the factor structure and the factorial validity, (c) the concurrent validity, (d) the discriminant validity, and (e) the test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients; ICC), and the internal consistency of the instrument. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was chosen to examine the factor structure of the CR-IWQ. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to examine further the factorial validity of the instrument. A number of valid constructs were used to assess the concurrent and discriminant validity of the CR-IWQ. The reliability of the new instrument was examined using Pearson r (ICC) and Cronbach α. Three hundred and seventy athletes with an acute musculoskeletal sport injury in the last year participated in the study. EFA revealed a 12-item model, representing two factors ("Re-injury worry due to rehabilitation" and "Re-injury worry due to opponent's ability"). CFA supported the two-factor model of the CR-IWQ. The concurrent and discriminant validity of the CR-IWQ was confirmed by examining correlations between the CR-IWQ with other constructs. The ICCs and the Cronbach α indices of the CR-IWQ were acceptable. We have demonstrated that the CR-IWQ is a good psychometric instrument that can be used for clinical and research purposes.

AB - An increasing number of service members have sustained injuries during their service in Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation New Dawn resulting in varying disabilities. Many community-based adapted sports programs, including therapeutic recreation programs, provide recreation and sport opportunities for injured service members. However, there is paucity of literature documenting effects of community-based adaptive sport on injured service member participants. Previous literature on adapted recreation, sport, and physical activity programs have focused on civilian populations who have sustained traumatic injury and who are enrolled in rehabilitation programs. Using a phenomenological lens to guide the research, findings indicated themes that align with self-determination theory and social comparison theory. Implications for therapeutic recreation services including suggestions for development of sports camps for injured service members are provided.

AB - This highly readable volume provides new strategies and scripts for hypnotherapists, sports counselors and sports psychologists working with athletes to help them achieve their peak performance. A major premise of the book is that the therapist does not necessarily need to be familiar with an athlete's particular sport or activity in order to serve as his or her 'mental coach'. The athlete is instructed that the goal is not to improve the mechanics of their performance (that is left up to their coaches) but, rather, to help them to relax, concentrate and focus so that they fulfill their maximum potential. They learn not to let the mental side of their game trip up the physical side, but rather to enhance it. There are also chapters on returning from injury and addictions, which are often important factors in athletes' careers. The book contains a number of case studies from a variety of sports where the author has worked successfully with athletes. In the case studies the author notes how surprised he was to learn that many clients have a vivid memory of the techniques he taught them, indicating just how important these techniques were to them.

AB - The focus and goal of public health is to prevent rather than treat a disease, which can be done through surveillance and the promotion of healthy behaviors and distribution of condoms are examples of public health measures. Many diseases can be prevented through simple, non-medical methods with hand washing to prevent disease as an easy example. When infectious disease declined during the last century, public health became more focused on chronic illness, prevention and health promotion issues. Population health has broadened the focus of public health from individual behaviors and risk factors to population issues such as inequality, poverty, education and the social determinants of health. It is our hope that the 2009 Public Health Yearbook will provide interest for the reader and we hope it will induce directions and new research in the field of public health.

AB - This chapter discusses the provision of medicines and medical service for athletes who participate in Olympic and commonwealth games. Providing medical services at Olympic, Paralympic and Commonwealth Games is a truly unique challenge, on a scale unrivalled by any other public event. Not only must the medical services cater to the highly specialised therapeutic needs of up to 14,000 athletes during the Olympics and 4,500 athletes of the Paralympic Games, but they must also supply the needs of accredited support staff, team medical units, officials, and media. For the London 2012 Olympic Games an expected 250,000 accredited people will fall under the care of the Olympic medical services, with around 40,000 people alone living in the Olympic Village. In addition to this, around 9 million tickets will be sold to spectators. London will see a huge population increase during the Games with a possible increased demand on local medical services. Staffing Olympic and Paralympic medical services is also a huge logistical operation. At the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games, a total of 4500 local medical volunteers provided specialist care at 35 Olympic venues; similarly, 4000 medical volunteers were recruited for the Atlanta 1996 Olympics. In Athens 2004, 400 specialist doctors, 400 nurses and 400 physiotherapists made up the core of the local medical team. For the pharmacy services alone in Beijing 2008, more than 50 pharmacists were required for two Olympic villages in Beijing and Hong Kong. In addition to the local medical workforce, over 1000 doctors also resided in the athlete village to treat each of the teams from around 200 countries. As well as looking after the athletes' therapeutic sports-medicine requirements, the doctors and pharmacists are also responsible for ensuring that the athletes do not inadvertently take a prohibited substance. In the international games environment, athletes rely heavily on the knowledge and advice of pharmacists, doctors and other medical staff for information on drugs banned in sport, particularly for drugs that are prescribed for the first time in the polyclinic at the Games. Intensive and specialist training on drugs in sport is provided for healthcare professionals working in the Games environment over the six months before the start of the Games. An additional responsibility of the Olympic and Commonwealth Games medical services is to ensure that healthcare professionals in the host city have the necessary information to hand should an athlete seek advice or treatment outside of the athlete village environment. For the Manchester 2002 Commonwealth Games, an education program containing information about drugs in sport was delivered to pharmacies and emergency departments within the vicinity of the Games. For the Beijing 2008 Games, all medical staff working in the city received training to equip them with knowledge about the drugs restricted in sport. Similarly, for the London 2012 Olympic Games, in addition to specific local training, a nationwide education initiative will be implemented to ensure that pharmacists across the UK are prepared to meet the pharmaceutical needs and advice for supporters and spectators, many of whom will be from overseas.

AB - Maximum performance in aerobic events, at whatever level of competition, is only achievable if respiratory function is optimal. Participants will always be concerned about respiratory problems whether they are from a major disease (e.g. asthma) or a minor ailment (e.g. the common cold). Their recourse to medications either to control or to alleviate symptoms of these conditions has brought many sportspersons into conflict with their national federations and Olympic committees. In the case of asthma, the best classes of drugs to treat this condition are beta-2 agonists (β2-agonists). These drugs produce their therapeutic effect through bronchodilation. Clearly, such an effect has the potential to enhance athletic performance by improving oxygen uptake. β2-agonists are therefore on the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) prohibited list. As first-line drugs for the treatment of asthma and other conditions involving bronchoconstriction, β2-agonists are necessary in the treatment regimes for such patients. A Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) is therefore required for asthmatic athletes in order to allow them to compete on equal terms with fellow competitors. This chapter will review the condition of asthma, the types of drugs used in its treatment, with particular emphasis on β2-agonists, the misuse of these drugs in sport and the systems in place for prohibiting β2-agonists as performance enhancing agents whilst permitting TUE, where appropriate.

AB - Mission statements are widely employed as a tool for strategic organizational planning. In sport, various types of organizations utilize their mission statements to communicate objectives that range from the development of responsible citizens to the importance of establishing professional standards of ethical practice for members. Research has shown that a mission statement's usefulness is related to organizational members' knowledge of it. In sport, it is not known if mission statements and the ethical messages they convey are effectively disseminated from those who develop them to the practitioners who implement them (e.g., coaches, athletes, sport psychologists, mental trainers). Therefore, using a case study approach, the purpose of this study was to trace the process of how one academic institution's mission statement was communicated to and understood by sport stakeholders. Results indicated that administrators were knowledgeable of the school's mission statement and that many coaches were at least familiar with the mission statement whereas parents and athletes reported very little or no knowledge. The findings of this study suggest possible issues in the communication of mission statements and implications for sport psychology organizations are discussed.

AB - As applied sport psychology continues to grow, a variety of professionals may attempt to teach athletes mental skills; however, there is little research to suggest which skills professionals may be qualified to use with their clients. This research examined sport professionals' use of psychological skills training (PST) and their previous training, self-efficacy, and perceptions of each skill. After a national survey, the final sample included 54 athletic trainers, 64 coaches, and 50 licensed psychologists ( n = 168). Psychologists reported using hypnosis and self-talk more frequently than ATCs and coaches, while coaches reported using team building and time management most often. Participants perceived hypnosis, energy management, imagery, and cognitive restructuring to require the most training out of the nine skills. These results are discussed within the context of developing a hierarchy of psychological skill used to guide professionals in their future work.

AB - This article focuses on the provision of sport psychology consultations to three professional soccer clubs by one sport psychology consultant (SPC). Over the past 10 years, the SPC worked with three different professional soccer clubs in Israel, each during a separate season. This article presents the experiences of the SPC based on his work with these three clubs. Typically, the team of experts that works for a professional soccer club in Israel is composed of a head coach, assistant coaches (one or two), a strength and conditioning coach, an athletic trainer, a physiotherapist, and a physician specializing in sports medicine. Few clubs hire a SPC in order to regularly provide their players and coaches with the required psychological preparation for practices and games. The reason for this is that most of the owners of the clubs believe that soccer is a physical game and not a mental game. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)

AB - This chapter discusses, the Japanese sports world has a longstanding tradition of using a mentoring style of coaching where the coaches strain their athletes in the same manner in which they were trained. This coaching style is a reflection of traditional Japanese cultural disciplines such as martial arts, religious practices, music, fine arts and crafts as well as tea and flower ceremonies where the master would teach the apprentice the skills and techniques that were imparted to them from previous masters who lived ages ago. In sports, this coaching legacy cycle repeats over and over again through the years as the athlete becomes the coach and the time-honored training practices are passed down to a new generation of athletes. These training practices are so culturally migraine into the sport that the use of any other method is often considered to be a show of disrespect towards the tradition of the sport. This attitude towards implementing new ideas and methods hold the for both traditional Japanese sports as well as for sports introduced from the West. With such strong traditional and cultural beliefs firmly in place, it is often difficult to introduce innovative sports science methods to Japanese coaches and athletes.

AB - At all levels of sport and across all ages of athlete, proper management of sport-related concussion or mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is crucial to ensure a complete recovery. Regardless of competition level, an athlete should progress through the same basic return-to-play procedures set forth by the three Concussion in Sport (CIS) group consensus statements (Aubry et al., 2002; McCrory et al., 2005, 2009). At the level of collegiate and professional sport, there are often additional pressures to return an athlete quickly to play. In professional and many highly visible collegiate sport teams, there is often widespread public awareness of a player's injured status. Usually, the decision to return a collegiate or professional athlete to sport practice or competition is one made through collaboration of specialists, including (but not limited to) athletic trainers, team physicians, neuropsychologists, and others. The neuropsychologist can offer unique insight and additional data regarding an athlete's cognitive functioning following an mTBI—an important marker of recovery and readiness to return to play. This chapter highlights the history of neuropsychology in concussion management, relevant research to this particular athlete demographic, and basic injury management strategies at this high level of competitive sport.

The discussion emerges from the perspective of those individuals who are actually involved in the administrative process of sport-related concussion management, including the team physician and the athletic trainer, but also athletic administrators, especially, the academic advisor and the athletic director. An account of management methods, protocols, and best practices is provided by professionals within the intercollegiate athletics department of a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I program who are involved in the concussion management process. The authors conclude that the management of concussion-related injuries in university athletics departments is best organized and conceptualized within a team approach, in which every expert brings different but relevant skills to the process and a premium is placed on the communication of relevant information among the team.

AB - In this study NCAA Division I coaches ( n = 815) completed a Web-based survey assessing their willingness to encourage athletes to see a sport psychology consultant (SPC), their support of possible roles for a SPC at their institution and, for coaches with current access to a SPC at their institutions, their willingness to seek mental training services for a variety of purposes. The results indicated that coaches were more willing to encourage their athletes to see a SPC for performance issues than for personal concerns and were more supportive of making mental training services available to athletes and including a SPC among athletic department staff than allowing a SPC to be present at practices and competitions. Coaches with current access to a SPC were primarily interested in mental training for performance enhancement purposes and were more willing to seek the services if they had more frequent contact with the SPC and perceived the SPC to be effective. These findings extend previous research on athletes’ and coaches’ receptivity to mental training and provide several important insights for SPCs working with athletic personnel at the NCAA Division I level.

AB - Objectives: This two-study article examines the functional aspects of the use of imagery and describes the relationship among function, content and characteristics of mental images used by expert golfers in different situations. Method: In Study 1, three methods of interviews (field interviews self-confrontation interviews and focus group) were used with 21 expert golfers to collect data about their use of imagery. In Study 2, 31 expert golfers were exposed to different situations (task-involving vs. ego-involving situations, easy vs. difficult tasks conditions) in order to examine the links between: (a) the function and the content, and the function and the characteristics of their mental images, and (b) the situation and the function of their mental images. Results: Results indicated that one category of content (images of the outcome with an internal perspective) was principally used by all participants. Moreover, the expert golfers adapted the content and the characteristics of their images according to the function that was required by the situation. The influence of the situation on imagery use highlighted in Study 1 was not confirmed in Study 2. Conclusions: Results confirm the links among function, content and characteristics of imagery postulated recently (Fournier, Deremaux, & Bernier, 2008; Murphy, Nordin, & Cumming, 2008; Nordin & Cumming, 2005). Taking into consideration these functional links should enhance the relevance of future research and help the sport psychology practitioner to better understand athletes’ use of imagery. The influence of the situation on imagery use still requires further exploration. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - This consensus statement summarizes key contemporary research themes relevant to understanding the psychology and socioculture of sport injury. Special consideration is given toward high-intensity sport in which elite athlete training and performance efforts are characterized by explosive physical speed and strength, mental fortitude to push physical limits, and maximum effort and commitment to highly challenging goals associated with achieving exceptional performance. Sport injury occurrence in high-intensity sport is an adverse and stressful health event associated with a complex multitude of risks, consequences and outcomes. A biopsychosocial (Engel, 1980) view is advocated which contextualizes an understanding of the psychological aspects of sport injury in light of influential sociocultural, ethical, and biomedical issues. Outcomes related to athlete health and performance excellence are of equal importance in considering how psychological scholarship, expertise and services can be used to improve efforts focused on the prevention and management of sport injury among high-intensity athletes. The consensus view is that psychology and socioculture do affect sport injury risk, response and recovery in high-intensity athletes, and that continued efforts in psychological research and professional practice are needed to protect athlete physical and mental health and contribute toward performance excellence and career longevity.

AB - This issue of the Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports provides the basic assumption that our mental abilities (i.e. the workings of the brain) including mental training can somehow be separated from the real physical world (where the muscles reign). There is no clear-cut separation between what the brain does when we carry out actual physical training as compared with when we are only thinking about it. Not only are many brain centers activated in both situations but also our ability to perform mental rehearsal greatly depends on our previous experience from doing physical exercise. According to the current understanding of how skills are acquired, the brain tests and updates with every movement – throughout our lives – the existing working model (or hypothesis) of how its body interacts with the environment. The body and the external world thus become represented in our brain/mind through our continuous interaction with our environment. The brain may also start to make simulations and test the (theoretical) outcome of a number of given actions in different scenarios. Brain and muscle are thus glued together in more ways than one and there is every reason – also in sport science – to mind the body in the brain.

This CD-ROM was designed and conceptualized with the primary intention of optimizing the "experience with anterior cruciate (ACL) surgery and rehabilitation." This multimedia resource could be used to help prepare individuals for their impending surgery and rehabilitation, but more importantly, it could also be used by allied health professionals such as certified athletic trainers, sport psychology consultants, and athletic training students seeking to enhance their work with these individuals. This CD-ROM is an excellent resource for the above mentioned allied health professionals. Certified athletic trainers could use this CD-ROM to review their knowledge base, especially if they do not frequently work with athletes who have sustained ACL injuries. Overall, the highlights of this CD-ROM include a review of the knee anatomy relevant to ACL injuries, specific details of the surgery, and the rehabilitation protocol. In closing, Conquering ACL Surgery and Rehabilitation is a very good resource for allied health professionals who will be working with individuals who have undergone ACL surgery.

AB - One reason sport psychologists teach psychological skills is to enhance performance in sport; but the value of psychological skills for young athletes is questionable because of the qualitative and quantitative differences between children and adults in their understanding of abstract concepts such as mental skills. To teach these skills effectively to young athletes, sport psychologists need to appreciate what young athletes implicitly understand about such skills because maturational (e.g., cognitive, social) and environmental (e.g., coaches) factors can influence the progressive development of children and youth. In the present qualitative study, we explored young athletes’ (aged 10–15 years) understanding of four basic psychological skills: goal setting, mental imagery, self-talk, and relaxation. Young athletes ( n = 118: 75 males and 43 females) completed an open-ended questionnaire to report their understanding of these four basic psychological skills. Compared with the older youth athletes, the younger youth athletes were less able to explain the meaning of each psychological skill. Goal setting and mental imagery were better understood than self-talk and relaxation. Based on these findings, sport psychologists should consider adapting interventions and psychoeducational programs to match young athletes’ age and developmental level.

AB - Eleven superelite participants (7 performers, 2 coaches and 2 sport psychologists) were interviewed regarding the development and maintenance of mental toughness. Findings revealed that this process occurred over four distinct career phases: three developmental phases, and one maintenance phase. Factors influencing development and maintenance included: skill mastery, competitiveness, successes, international competitive experience, education and advice, the use of psychological skills, access to an understanding social support network, and reflective practice. In addition, positive and negative critical incidents were perceived by participants to act as catalysts in initiating or enhancing specific components of mental toughness. Practical implications highlight the importance of a mental toughness attitude/mindset to development, while future directions are discussed in relation to measurement and intervention strategies.

AB - Reviews the book, The Best Tennis of Your Life: 50 Strategies for Fearless Performance by Jeff Greenwald (2007). The author of this book presents the reader with fifty brief chapters that address fifty mental strategies, respectively. These chapters include strategies about finding pleasure with pressure, engaging in the learning process, facing your fears, developing emotional and physical flexibility, quieting your mind and being patient with the process. In addition to many of the traditional sport psychology concepts and strategies such as visualization, goal setting, emotional regulation, and focus of attention, the author offers many behavior based strategies that will serve to compliment the tennis player's performance enhancement efforts. These behavior based strategies are not typical of many mental performance books, and serve to enrich the value of this book and set it apart from many of its competitors. The author also balances the content of this book through the inclusion of excerpts based on the experiences of well known professionals, his personal experiences, detailed steps about how to implement each strategy, and supportive or inspirational statements. Thus, this book will surely fulfill its purpose of helping tennis players master their game by implementing mental strategies that will empower them to play "fearless tennis".

AB - We explored mental toughness in soccer using a triangulation of data capture involving players ( n = 6), coaches ( n = 4), and parents ( n = 5). Semi-structured interviews, based on a personal construct psychology (Kelly, 1955/1991) framework, were conducted to elicit participants’ perspectives on the key characteristics and their contrasts, situations demanding mental toughness, and the behaviours displayed and cognitions employed by mentally tough soccer players. The results from the research provided further evidence that mental toughness is conceptually distinct from other psychological constructs such as hardiness. The findings also supported Gucciardi, Gordon, and Dimmock’s (2009) process model of mental toughness. A winning mentality and desire was identified as a key attribute of mentally tough soccer players in addition to other previously reported qualities such as self-belief, physical toughness, work ethic/motivation, and resilience. Key cognitions reported by mentally tough soccer players enabled them to remain focused and competitive during training and matches and highlighted the adoption of several forms of self-talk in dealing with challenging situations. Minor revisions to Gucciardi and colleagues’ definition of mental toughness are proposed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - The present study not only explored the influence of golf expertise on mental skills utilization, but also the influences of the use of mental skills and anxiety on performance at a major national golf competition. Participants, who had played golf for an average of 23 years, ranged in age ( M = 52.17, SD = 11.81) and in skill level ( M handicap = 15.58, SD = 6.41), included 1151 male and 173 female amateur golfers competing in the Dupont World Amateur Golf Championship in Myrtle Beach, SC. Measures targeted mental skills utilization, golf-specific skills, and competitive trait anxiety. Multivariate analysis of covariance was used to examine the use of psychological skills across age (≤49, 50 and above) and levels of golf skill (Professional Golf Association certified handicaps, ≤11, 12–19, and ≥20), and based upon prospective longitudinal data, hierarchical regression analyses were used to determine those factors that predicted successful golf performance across all three rounds of the tournament. Not surprisingly, consistent differences in the use of psychological skills across skill level were found, favoring more skilled players. The most salient predictors of better tournament performance (lower gross scores) were automaticity, commitment to golf, and disruptions in concentration, whereas positive self-talk predicted higher scores. These findings reinforce the role of automaticity in fostering the experience of peak performance in a competitive sport context.

AB - The aims of this study were to identify the mental toughness profiles of adolescent Australian footballers and to explore the relations between the mental toughness clusters and achievement goals and sport motivation. A total of 214 non-elite, male Australian footballers aged 16–18 years (mean = 16.8, s = 0.7) provided self-reports of mental toughness, achievement goals, and sport motivation. Cluster analysis supported the presence of two-groups in which players evidenced moderate and high levels of all four mental toughness subscales. Significant multivariate effects were observed for achievement goals and sport motivation with the high mental toughness group favouring both mastery- and performance-approach goals and self-determined as well as extrinsic motivational tendencies. The results suggest that adolescent Australian footballers’ self-perceptions of mental toughness fall within two clusters involving high and moderate forms of all four components, and that these profiles show varying relations with achievement goals (particularly mastery-approach) and sport motivation.

Nineteen elite male sport climbers ( M = 24.6, SD = 4.0 years of age) completed the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2 and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule before an international rock climbing competition. Climbing performances were video-recorded to calculate movement fluency (entropy) and obtain ascent times. Official route scores were also obtained. Successful climbers reported higher pre-performance levels of somatic anxiety and climbed the most difficult part of the route more slowly than their unsuccessful counterparts. The psychological states preceding elite climbing competition appeared to be an important factor in determining success, even when differences in baseline ability were taken into account.

Addressing this, the current study had two aims: (a) to examine the perceptions held by youth athletes regarding the mental qualities they need to facilitate their development and (b) to investigate the mental techniques used by these athletes. Forty-three male youth rugby players participated in a series of focus groups. Inductive content analysis revealed 11 categories of psychological qualities, including enjoyment, responsibility, adaptability, squad spirit, self-aware learner, determination, confidence, optimal performance state, game sense, attentional focus, and mental toughness. Techniques employed included personal performance strategies, reflection on action, taking advantage of a supportive climate, and team-based strategies. Findings are discussed in relation to their implications for mental skills training program development and evaluation in the case of youth elite team sport athletes.

AB - Given the complexity of the talent development process, it seems likely that a range of psychological factors underpin an athlete’s ability to translate potential into top-class performance. Therefore, the purpose of part one of this two-part investigation was to explore the attributes that facilitate the successful development of athletes from initial involvement to achieving and maintaining world-class status. Seven elite athletes and a parent of each of these athletes were interviewed regarding their own (their son’s/ daughter’s) development in sport. Data were content analyzed using a grounded theory approach. Although sporting achievement was conceptualized as being multidimensional, psychological factors were highlighted as the key determinants of those who emerged as talented and maintained excellence. Accordingly, we suggest that talent identification and development programs should place greater emphasis on the advancement and application of psychological behaviors at an early stage to optimize both the development and performance of athletes.

Undeniably, something about this game, and other sports, has the power to draw millions—young and old, male and female—to our screens and to the fields of play. Until recently, the principles of clinical psychology appear to have had little impact in professional sports environments. But recent events demonstrate this could be changing for the better. In some of the more unlikely environments, ideas of mental health and self-awareness are flourishing, and values of training are changing. How can recent understandings inform us as practitioners? And what are the implications for home, school, and clinical settings? This article will raise awareness of the culture and clinical studies that relate to youth in sport and of the implications of recent studies for teachers and children.

AB - Mild traumatic brain injuries are one of the most clinically difficult conditions to manage in sports medicine. Better understanding the biomechanics of head impacts will allow clinicians and researchers to better implement interventions designed specifically to reduce the incidence of injury. To date, few studies have looked at the biomechanics of head impacts in the young athlete. The overall objective of this dissertation was to evaluate the biomechanics of head impact severity during participation in youth ice hockey, with a specific evaluation of descriptive factors, and intrinsic and extrinsic factors related to impact biomechanics while playing hockey. We studied a two-year cohort of Bantam and Midget-aged ice hockey players, all of whom participated in all practices and games while wearing specially instrumented helmets capable of measuring head impact measures including linear acceleration, rotational acceleration, and the Head Impact Technology severity profile (HITsp). We also video-recorded every game in the first year of the study and developed an evaluation tool in order to characterize a number of aspects related to relative body positioning and overall anticipation of impending collisions. We also recorded a wide range of information including the number of shifts played, cervical muscle strength, player head and neck anthropometrics, measures of trait aggression, and general aerobic fitness. Our data support the notion that anticipating collisions may play a role in minimizing head impact severity. We also found impacts occurring in the open ice were greater than those occurring along the playing boards. Further, illegal player infractions occur at a relatively high frequency and typically result in higher measures of head impact severity than legal collisions, especially as it pertains to elbowing, head contact, and high sticking infractions to the head. Based on our data, it does not appear that those with stronger neck muscles are better able to mitigate the forces associated with head impacts. Our data suggest a continued need to educate our players with the necessary technical skills needed to heighten their awareness on the ice. Coaches and athletes should incorporate body collision exercises in practices, and spend time educating young athletes on these proper checking techniques in an attempt to minimize the risk of injury and increase the safety of ice hockey.

AB - Increasingly large numbers of students who experience emotional, social and behavioural difficulties are subject to exclusion from mainstream schools and consequently receive their education in pupil referral units (PRUs). Common perceptions of PRUs are that they are places where high levels of conflict and relatively few constructive relationships occur. In the regular educational psychologist input to an inner city secondary PRU, ideas from a range of psychological models and theories including humanist psychology, personal construct psychology, solution-focused brief therapy and systemic theory were used to highlight some exceptions to these social difficulties. More constructive social interaction and reduced levels of conflict were observed when students engaged in sports activities together and, therefore, the professional coaching input of a local premiership football club's (XFC's) 'Sport in the Community' programme (SiC) was negotiated and an initial eight-week evaluation project constructed. This paper considers the importance of relationships within the rationale, planning, implementation and evaluation of the project which developed. One of the central aims of this project was to utilise and support the development of more positive relationships between the pupils, the PRU staff and the professional sports coaches in order to engage the pupils more constructively in their educational experience and to support their social and emotional development and their learning in general. The consistently positive feedback from the students, PRU staff and coaches, which emphasised the importance of the relational aspects of the project is considered in relation to further possible interventions and research undertaken by applied psychologists working in education.

AB - In this study, we assessed the relationship between mental toughness and athletes’ use of psychological performance strategies. Sixty-seven male (mean age 22.6 years, s = 5.0) and 40 female (mean age 21.1 years, s = 2.8) athletes, who competed at club/university to national standard in a variety of sports, participated in the study. Participants completed the MTQ48 (Clough et al., 2002) to measure mental toughness, and the Test of Performance Strategies (TOPS; Thomas et al., 1999) to measure the use of psychological strategies in practice and competition. Results of Pearson correlations and linear regression analyses revealed that self-talk, emotional control, and relaxation strategies were significantly and positively ( r = 0.26 to 0.37, P < 0.01) related to mental toughness in both practice and competition. Of the MTQ48 subscales, commitment was found to load most frequently against performance strategies and thus it is possible that the results of this study reflect highly committed performers seeking performance enhancement strategies. Consistent with theoretical predictions, athletes of county standard and above reported significantly higher mental toughness than club/university athletes ( t 105 = -2.25, P = 0.03).

AB - The present study examined how elite female gymnasts developed their mental toughness. Following semistructured interviews with 10 elite performers, inductive content analysis revealed four general dimensions that contributed to the development of their mental toughness. These included the sport process, sporting personnel, nonsporting personnel, and environmental influences. Although many of the findings reflect those from previous research but within a specific sport, a unique and unexpected finding related to the cultural differences experienced by the athletes throughout their development. The findings provide further details of how mental toughness could be developed in addition to future research and applied issues being discussed.

AB - The aim of this study was to examine the influence of fatigue on running biomechanics in normal running, in normal running with a cognitive task, and in running while map reading. Nineteen international and less experienced orienteers performed a fatiguing running exercise of duration and intensity similar to a classic distance orienteering race on an instrumented treadmill while performing mental arithmetic, an orienteering simulation, and control running at regular intervals. Two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance did not reveal any significant difference between mental arithmetic and control running for any of the kinematic and kinetic parameters analysed eight times over the fatiguing protocol. However, these parameters were systematically different between the orienteering simulation and the other two conditions (mental arithmetic and control running). The adaptations in orienteering simulation running were significantly more pronounced in the elite group when step frequency, peak vertical ground reaction force, vertical stiffness, and maximal downward displacement of the centre of mass during contact were considered. The effects of fatigue on running biomechanics depended on whether the orienteers read their map or ran normally. It is concluded that adding a cognitive load does not modify running patterns. Therefore, all changes in running pattern observed during the orienteering simulation, particularly in elite orienteers, are the result of adaptations to enable efficient map reading and/or potentially prevent injuries. Finally, running patterns are not affected to the same extent by fatigue when a map reading task is added. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

This case study aimed at understanding the influence of sporting goals in the emotional conflicts of an swimmer, even showing physical skills and techniques in training sessions, could not get improvements in sports scores, going forward, on a recurring basis by a period of two years, apathetic behavior in the competitive environment. For the investigation of experiences, it was used the psychological interview with the narratives submitted to the phenomenological method to the interpretation of data. The change in behavior and performance of sports athlete demonstrated that phenomenology can be used as a methodological foundation in psychological interventions in the sports field, both for a new athletic significance of the results in reset new goals focus on sports, preservation of health mental competitive athletes, as well as in qualitative research of these activities.

AB - Mental rehearsal—defined as repeatedly imagining the performance of a motor skill—is not only an important research topic in sport science but also an important aspect of applied sport psychology. This article proposes that mental rehearsal is a simulation involving different levels: First, the simulation can be described on a neurophysiological level; in this respect motor imagery is seen as actual actions relying on the same brain regions, but these are not actually executed. Second, simulation refers to the motor control concept of internal models,where the forward model assumes the function of an emulator. And third, it is proposed that the effects estimated by the emulator offer a plausible learning mechanism to explain the effects of mental rehearsal. The advantage of the concept of simulation is that it can be expanded to other mental states that represent covert motor actions. Thus, it offers a general framework for motor cognition. Furthermore, the term "simulation" covers the flexible and phenomenological experience of the first-person perspective. The concept of simulation generates several predictions which can be tested in future studies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - Mental toughness is one of the most common terms used in sport—by athletes, coaches, spectators and the media. However, this book provides a definitive and readable overview of the area, and presents the cutting-edge research in the field of mental toughness. The book introduces the historical and conceptual arguments behind this research, and looks at the characteristics and development of mentally tough sport performers. It suggests that mental toughness is a personality style and mindset, presenting a case for its inclusion within the positive psychological paradigm. The book also explores various measures of this concept and their psychometric properties, and considers cultural and national perspectives as well as the possibility of mental toughness heredity. Sheard exposes the development and maintenance of mental toughness as a factor for successful sport and life performance, and discusses the possibilities for future research on the subject. This book is unique in considering the idea of mental toughness as an "achievement mindset" and is an invaluable resource for sport and exercise psychology and science students and lecturers. It also provides an important reference for sport participants, coaches, and enthusiasts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(cover)

In this chapter, we review the development of sport psychology in China over the last 30 years, using Chinese sources primarily from mainland China and to a lesser extent Hong Kong. Developments in the four important areas of talent identification, sport cognition, mental training models, and on-field psychological support are presented in chronological order to reflect this development.

AB - As long as athletes strive to attain optimal performance states and consistently reach high performance goals, psychological interventions will be used to assist in the development of skill and the maintenance of performance. In the pursuit of these goals, newer evidence-driven models based on mindfulness- and acceptance-based approaches have been designed to achieve these ends. Based upon questionable efficacy data for traditional psychological skills training procedures that emphasize reduction or control of internal processes, mindfulness- and acceptance-based approaches develop skills of nonjudging mindful awareness, mindful attention, and experiential acceptance to aid in the pursuit of valued goals. The most formalized and researched mindfulness- and acceptance-based approach within sport psychology is the manualized Mindfulness-Acceptance-Commitment (MAC) protocol. In the 8 years since the MAC was first developed and presented, and the 5 years since the first publication on the protocol, the MAC program has accumulated a continually growing empirical base for both its underlying theory and intervention efficacy as a performance enhancement intervention. This article reviews the empirical and theoretical foundations of the mindfulness- and acceptance-based approaches in general, and MAC in particular; reviews the accumulated empirical findings in support of the MAC approach for performance enhancement; and presents recent MAC developments and suggested future directions.

AB - Besides Burt Giges, the Past President of the Association of Applied Sport Psychology (AASP), I am the only sport psychiatrist to attended the last six AASP annual conferences. Each year, I have heard increasing concerns regarding the divide between sport psychologists and sport scientists. Some sport scientists found out from their athletic directors after the recommendations were printed in a NCAA News. The task force was reportedly made up of mostly sport psychologists and many sport scientists felt blind sided. There were lingering hard feelings on the part of sport scientists. It is my opinion that referring to yourself as a sport psychologist when you are not a licensed psychologist is misleading, unethical, and in most states, illegal. While most sport scientists claim that they refer athletes to sport psychologists when they recognize a mental health concern in teaching mental skills, I think they might not be fully aware that some of their athletes might be confused by thinking that they are working with a sport psychologist. While everyone would agree that teaching mental skills is necessary and sport scientists should be working in every NCAA school, the point person should be a clinician and the differences should be made very clear to all coaches, trainers, and athletes at the beginning of every year.

AB - In the current study NCAA Division I student-athletes ( n = 2,440) completed a Web based survey assessing their willingness to seek mental skills training, perceptions of the potential benefits of mental training for their team, and support of possible roles for a sport psychology consultant at their institution. Multiple chi-square tests revealed significant ( p < .001) dependence of respondents' ratings on gender, sport type (individual vs. team), prior experience with a sport psychology consultant, and perceived effectiveness of prior experience (low, moderate, high). Generally, females were more receptive than males, individual and team sport athletes were interested in different types of mental skills, athletes with prior consulting experience were more open than those with none, and athletes with highly effective prior experience were more receptive than those with less effective experience. These findings extend previous research examining collegiate student-athletes' attitudes toward sport psychology consulting and provide several important insights for consultants conducting mental skills training for NCAA Division I level athletes.

AB - The purpose of this study was to explore elite coaches’ perceptions of how they can both facilitate and impede the development of key mental toughness characteristics in the context of Australian football. Eleven coaches from a previous study (Gucciardi, Gordon, & Dimmock, 2008) were re-interviewed and the transcribed verbatim data were analysed using grounded theory data analytical procedures (Strauss & Corbin, 1998). Five categories that appear to be central to the coach’s role in the development of mental toughness in Australian football emerged. Four of these categories (coach–athlete relationship, coaching philosophy, training environments, and specific strategies) were said to facilitate the developmental process, whereas the final category (negative experiences and influences) was said to impede this process. A grounded theory in which the aforementioned categories enable coaches to nurture a "generalized form" of mental toughness acquired during one’s formative years into a "sport-specific form" pertinent to Australian football is presented. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - The purpose of this research project was to develop a psychometrically sound measure of mental toughness in cricket, using a multi-method research design. Two qualitative studies in which current and former cricketers' ( n = 16) perceptions of the key components of mental toughness in cricket and the suitability of an item pool to target those key components ( n = 9) were assessed. We then conducted two quantitative studies to examine both the within- and between-network properties of the Cricket Mental Toughness Inventory (CMTI) using confirmatory factor analysis and correlations. Support for the existence of a five-factor, 15-item model was revealed with three independent samples of cricketers; two contained cricketers from several different countries ( n = 285 and 285), whereas one contained Australian cricketers only ( n = 433). Each of the five subscales (affective intelligence, attentional control, resilience, self-belief, and desire to achieve) were positively correlated with dispositional flow, hardiness, and resilience and negatively correlated with athlete burnout. Although requiring replication and extension, the results of the present study provide preliminary support for the factor structure, internal reliability, and construct validity of the CMTI.

First, we provide an English translation of Puni's theoretical and practical tutorial on volitional preparation in sport. Then, we discuss how Puni's model was grounded in the socio-political and cultural particularities of his era and suggest some ways it might be used to stimulate future research and theorizing on the development of mental toughness. Finally, we offer some possible applications of the model for practitioners in preparing athletes for the rigors of competition.

AB - Reviews the book, The psychology of achieving sports excellence: A self help guide for athletes by Larry Leith (2008). This trade book clearly aims to help athletes and average people to actually go apply mental skills. Consistent with many kinds of self-help guides, the author makes definitive claims that his book "will improve your performance," and he presents each technique in a manner that suggests that there is no question it will help. Nonetheless, the author writes in a straightforward manner that utilizes his vast real world experience within the sport culture. He describes how athletes can use principles of mental skills without clinging to a cookbook style of how it should be done. Another strength of the authors guide is that acknowledges the identify of the athlete as a whole person. A confident presentation of how to use and develop mental skills, the book introduces everyday readers to concepts that are often addressed in more unwieldy sport psychology textbooks. This book could be a wonderful resource to any kind of performer trying to engage in mental training without a professional to assist. It could also be a great complement to the library of sport psychology consultants and educators working with individuals, teams, or classes.

AB - Over the past three decades, the world of both amateur and professional sports has expanded greatly and become more complex. In part related to these changes—and relatively unknown to sports medicine practitioners—the field of sport psychiatry has steadily evolved and grown. This paper focuses on what these changes have been. A sport psychiatrist is a physician-psychiatrist who diagnoses and treats problems, symptoms and/or disorders associated with an athlete, with their family/significant others, with their team, or with their sport, including spectators/fans. The primary aims of the specialty are to (i) optimize health, (ii) improve athletic performance, and (iii) manage psychiatric symptoms or disorders. The training includes medical training to provide knowledge and skills unique to physicians; psychiatric training to provide knowledge and skills inherent in that field, and training and/or experience in sport psychiatry to provide knowledge and skills about psychiatric aspects of sports. The sport psychiatrist first makes an individual, family-systems and phenomenological diagnosis of the clinical situation. Based on this evaluation, he sets goals for not only the athlete, but also for significant others involved. He delivers treatment based on the psychiatric disorder or problem using a combination of medication, psychotherapy or self-help group interventions plus strategies targeted to specific sport performance issues. Evolution of the International Society of Sport Psychiatry as well as the field, including incorporation into school and professional team sports, is described along with a 'typical day' for a sport psychiatrist.

AB - The relation between nationality and selected indicators of psychological performance in rugby league football was examined. Mental toughness was assessed using the alternative Psychological Performance Inventory (PPI-A) and hardiness using the Personal Views Survey III—R (PVS III—R). Participants ( N = 49, M age = 21.7 yr., SD = 2.3) were male elite-level university rugby league footballers representing Australia and Great Britain. Participants completed the questionnaires in training camp in Sydney, Australia, one week prior to the commencement of an international tournament there in 2006. Multivariate analyses revealed that the Australian Universities players had significantly higher mean scores on Positive Cognition, Visualization, Total Mental Toughness, and Challenge than their opponents from Great Britain. The Australian Universities players were also the tournament winners. The findings concur with previous research indicating superior mental toughness and hardiness are related to successful sport performance. Practical implications focus on the potentiality of ameliorative cultural environments. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - When standards, values and symbols of a sports culture change, the athlete's own economic psyche weakens. The purpose of this article is to define the various levels of psychological realities which a clinical sports psychology is compared with the psychology of the sportman which differs from its environment. The concepts covered in this article stem from observations made during consultations with athletes who had an identity crisis and lacked social recognition. The conclusion focuses on the change the athlete undergoes during his/her psychological conversion and cultural conversion. This change is especially noteworthy when the sports clinic assesses the bonds the athlete has with his/her body and social environment.

The aim of this paper is twofold: first, to make the sportsmen and sportswomen to activate his best competitive resources in that championship, and secondly, to test the subjective value that would have the specific technical implementation of a management submodalities of thought for these athletes, to facilitate the expression of that potential in the fight. The procedure was carried out along four single sessions, once a week, for 45 minutes (three sessions before tournament and one at the end). After intervention, there is a high satisfaction with the athletes respect the technique used, as well as a subjective experience very favourable during the competition. In this way, we opened a new line of psychological intervention based in the context of PNL for the sport of taekwondo. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of two different psychological skills training (PST) packages in enhancing mental toughness among three youth-aged (under 15 years old) Australian football teams. We compared a program targeting the keys to mental toughness identified previously (Gucciardi, Gordon, & Dimmock, 2008) with a more traditional PST program targeting self-regulation, arousal regulation, mental rehearsal, attentional control, self-efficacy, and ideal performance state as well as a control group. Overall, both intervention groups reported more positive changes in subjective ratings of mental toughness, resilience, and flow than the control group. Similar ratings for mental toughness were reported by the parents and coaches. Both PST packages appeared to be equally effective in enhancing mental toughness.

AB - The sport psychology has been emphasized more and more as fundamental for athlete’s performance. In Tennis this importance is increased due to the inherent difficulties to this sport, mainly those related to the emotional issues. Although this work had as objective to verify the importance of the coach in mental preparation of young tennis players’ category. It is because of the topic relevance of psychological support and the difficulties intrinsic to youth in transition to the professional stage and the coach. The guide has much to contribute in this direction. It was carry out interviews structured with 10 young players and were analyzed through Collective Subject Speech. According to reports players, verify that coach is highly important in training young tennis player and that mental aspect is decisive, however little has been done to improve tennis players’ psychological preparation.

AB - Problem: There has been a recent upsurge of research interest in cognitive sport psychology or the scientific study of mental processes (e.g., mental imagery) in athletes. Despite this interest, an important question has been neglected. Specifically, is research on cognitive processes in athletes influential outside sport psychology, in the "parent" field of cognitive psychology or in the newer discipline of cognitive neuroscience? Objectives: The purpose of this paper is to explore the theoretical significance of research on expertise, attention and mental imagery in athletes from the perspective of cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience. Method: Following analysis of recent paradigm shifts in cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience, a narrative review is provided of key studies on expertise, attention and mental imagery in athletes. Results and conclusions: This paper shows that cognitive sport psychology has contributed significantly to theoretical understanding of certain mental processes studied in cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience. It also shows that neuroscientific research on motor imagery can benefit from increased collaboration with cognitive sport psychology. Overall, I conclude that the domain of sport offers cognitive researchers a rich and dynamic natural laboratory in which to study how the mind works.

AB - This review is designed to advance current conceptualizations of mental toughness in sport as well as identify avenues for future research by offering a fresh perspective using Kelly's (1955/1991) personal construct psychology (PCP). After reviewing sport-general and sport-specific research contributing to current perspectives on mental toughness, we highlight the need for theoretically driven research in the area. Following this, we provide an overview PCP and offer a conceptual model grounded in PCP which attempts to organize the knowledge base as well as provide a platform for future research. In integrating previous research with PCP, we propose a construct definition in which the multidimensional nature of mental toughness, its usefulness for dealing with and thriving through both positively and negatively construed situations, and the processes by which this occurs are highlighted. Specifically, mental toughness is defined as a collection of values, attitudes, emotions, and cognitions that influence the way in which an individual approaches, responds to, and appraises demanding events to consistently achieve his or her goals. To conclude, methodological and conceptual limitations associated with previous research are examined and the PCP model of mental toughness presented here is employed to identify avenues for future research.

AB - Since the response to injury is both physical and psychological (e.g., Brewer & Cornelius, 2003; Wiese-Bjornstal, Smith, Shaffer, & Morrey, 1998), numerous researchers have advocated using psychological interventions in conjunction with physical therapy to optimize an athlete's recovery from injury. No empirical study has examined how to craft a mental skills intervention for injured athletes from initial post-injury assessment. The purpose of the present study was to explore injured athletes’ experiences with a multimodal mental skills intervention to gain insight into how to create a mental skills plan for rehabilitation from initial post-injury assessment. Single subject and qualitative methodology were utilized. Six participants completed the approximately eight week study in which participants learned four mental skills: (1) goal setting; (2) relaxation; (3) imagery; and (4) managing self-talk. Using an ABCA or ACBA design, the impact of the interventions on the following eight variables was examined: (1) self-reported use of mental skills; (2) perceived effectiveness of mental skills; (3) satisfaction with mental skills interventions; (4) self-efficacy for rehabilitation; (5) self-efficacy for return to sport; (6) adherence; (7) attitude; and (8) speed of recovery. Participants showed varied responses to the mental skills interventions and reported several positive physical and psychological outcomes of using the mental skills. Participants demonstrated little change in self-efficacy for rehabilitation and return to sport, adherence, attitude, and speed of recovery over the course of the study, as most participants scored high throughout the study on these measures. Sport psychology consultants and future researchers may want to explore other post-injury assessment methods and choose less than four mental skills to focus on for a mental rehabilitation program with injured athletes. Athletic trainers can also incorporate simple mental techniques in rehabilitation to help athletes achieve positive outcomes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - This study used a mixed-method to look at NCAA division I head softball coaches confidence, openness, and stigma tolerance about sport psychology principles and consultants, as well as what sport psychology principles, time of year used, and what a Sport Psychology Consultant (SPC) can do to help division I head softball coaches have more success with their teams. These variables were measured through the use of the Sport Psychology Attitudes—Revised Coaches instrument developed by Zakrajsek and Zizzi (2007). For the qualitative component, the researcher developed five inquiries that allowed for a more in-depth response from the coaches concerning principles used, confidence in using, and when they are implementing the principles. Descriptives of the data show that coaches feel mental skills are important, while descriptives of the independent variables of age gender and years coaching revealed that none of these variables are significantly related to a coach's use of an SPC. A two-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to analyze differences in the dependent variables of openness, stigma tolerance, and confidence as a function of gender and the use of sport psychology consultants. The results show that a significant difference based on respondent's use of consultants; however, no significant differences were found for gender. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted as a follow-up. For the factor, use of sport psychology consultants, the ANOVA for stigma tolerance was significant. The ANOVA for confidence and openness was non-significant. The five inquiries revealed five to eight themes per inquiry. Overall, NCAA division I head softball coaches use of sport psychology principles and SPCs falls in line with previous research done by Weinberg & Gould (2007) as to the principles used and when the best time to implement them is.

AB - The purpose of this study was to investigate expectations of collegiate head coaches about sport psychology consulting. There were two null hypotheses in this study: first, there will be no difference in expectations of sport psychology consulting between male and female collegiate head coaches of NCAA Division I, II, and III athletic programs; second, there will be no difference in expectations of sport psychology consulting between head coaches of male and female athletic programs at Division I, II, and III level. Items from the Expectations About Sport Psychology Consulting (EASPC) questionnaire (Martin et al., 2001) were revised to reflect a head coaches' perspective. The revised instrument, Coaches' Expectations About Sport Psychology Consulting (CESPC) questionnaire, was administered to 404 collegiate head coaches (244 male coaches and 160 female coaches) of both male and female team sports (248 female teams and 156 male teams) from NCAA Division I, II, and III athletic teams. Results of a 2 (Gender of the Sport) X 3 (NCAA Level of Competition) MANOVA indicated a significant main effect for gender of the sport. Univariate ANOVAs indicated a significant effect for personal commitment. In addition, results of the 2 (Gender of the Coach) X 3 (NCAA Level of Competition) MANOVA indicated a significant main effect for gender of the head coach. Univariate ANOVAs indicated a significant effect for personal commitment. Subsequent univariate ANOVAs also revealed a significant interaction between the level of sport (e.g., NCAA Division I, Division II, and Division III) and gender with respect to SPC expertise. Results indicated that the CESPC instrument might be a valuable tool for determining head coaches' expectations about sport psychology consulting. Interpretations of the results for each hypothesis are included and implications for sport psychology consultants are discussed based on these findings. Finally, study limitations are identified and suggestions for future research are made. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Sport scientists have been studying the importance of psychological factors in optimal performance since the early 1980s. This study examined a new psychological construct, grit, which has proven to be an effective predictor of academic performance. The researcher questioned whether grit could also predict athletic performance. This study also investigated the construct mental toughness to distinguish if it is similar to grit or, if grit is truly a unique psychological characteristic. Participants ( N = 57) for this study were chosen from a convenience sample of volleyball athletes at a small Midwestern university. Participants completed both the Grit-R (Duckworth, Peterson, Matthews & Kelly, 2007) and Mental Toughness Inventories (MTI; Middleton, Marsh, Martin, Richards & Perry, 2004). Performance was measured by recording the passing and attacking efficiency scores for athletes. In order to test Hypothesis 1, a multiple regression analysis was conducted. The results revealed that neither mental toughness (β = .068; p = .661) nor grit (β = -.128; p = .408) were significant predictors of performance. Null Hypothesis 1 was accepted. To test Hypothesis 2, a correlation was conducted to analyze the relationship between grit and mental toughness. Results indicated that mental toughness has a strong positive association with grit ( r = .424, p < .01). A regression analysis explored how the two measurements are related. Findings revealed that mental toughness is significantly, positively associated with grit ( t [53, 1] = .340, p = .001), indicating they may be similar constructs. Null Hypothesis 2 was rejected. The results of this study conclude that neither grit nor mental toughness are reliable predictors of athletic performance. Other factors must be considered when identifying elite athletes. A limitation of the study is that it relies on self-report questionnaires, which are known to be influenced by social desirability. The results of this study cannot be generalized because of its small sample size ( N = 57) from a single university. Future research may focus on grit as applied to other disciplines. A larger, representative sample with participants who possess a wider range of skill—intramural athletes to Olympians should be used. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - This study examines the construct validity of an original self-report instrument for the assessment of mental toughness: the Sports Mental Toughness Questionnaire (SMTQ). Two independent studies supported a three-factor (Confidence, Constancy, and Control) 14-item model for the SMTQ. With a sample of 633 athletes (427 males, 206 females; M age = 21.5 years; SD = 5.48), drawn from 25 sport classifications, and competing at international, national, county and provincial, or club and regional standards, the first study utilized item development and exploratory factor analytic techniques to establish the psychometric properties of the SMTQ. Study 2 employed confirmatory factor analytic techniques with an independent sample of 509 sports performers (351 males, 158 females; M age = 20.2 years; SD = 3.35), competing at the aforementioned standards, and representative of 26 sports. Confirmatory analysis using structural equation modeling confirmed the overall structure. A single factor underlying mental toughness (Gmt) was identified with higher-order exploratory factor analysis using the Schmid-Leiman procedure. Collectively, satisfying absolute and incremental fit-index benchmarks, the inventory was shown to possess satisfactory psychometric properties, with adequate reliability, divergent validity, and discriminative power. The results revealed promising features of the SMTQ, lending preliminary support to the instrument’s factorial validity and reliability. Further construct validation of the SMTQ is recommended, including its use as an index for evaluating the effect of intervention programs.

AB - Much of applied sport psychology focuses on mental training or mental skills. There is clearly great benefit in looking at the mental aspects of performance and experience. In this article, we explore how mental aspects (language/mind) can be considered in a broader perspective of the human being, which includes emotion/mood and the body. We illustrate how a somatic view (e.g., Strozzi-Heckler, 2003, 2007) creates potentially powerful methods of working through the body, enabling a more holistic approach to understanding and helping clients. Examples of using these methods in sport psychology consultations with collegiate and other elite athletes and performers are presented. A case study shows how these perspectives are incorporated into initial consultations, intakes, and interventions. The intention here is that the ideas, experiences, and tools presented will help expand the service repertoires of sport psychology practitioners.

AB - Exercise imagery is an emerging topic in health and exercise psychology research. Previous studies have found that exercise imagery may have cognitive and motivational effects on exercise behaviors. However, the research in exercise imagery has focused primarily on college students and the use of qualitative methods. Therefore, this study expanded previous research by using qualitative methods with middle-aged adults. Specifically, 30 middle-aged adults from 35 to 65 (M=48.13, SD=8.33) that included 11 males and 19 females were interviewed to examine when, where, what (content), and why (function) they used imagery focused on their exercise behaviors. By using grounded theory procedures, results revealed seven higher order themes: exercise technique images, appearance images, health outcome images, plan/strategy images, stress level/emotion images, confidence enhancing images, and energy/drive images. These results were consistent with previous research and theoretical frameworks in imagery. Certain quotes were chosen from the interviews to highlight each higher order theme. Some additional findings were the importance of health imagery, the thoughts of past images of self and comparing to present, making plans/strategies to motivate oneself to exercise, and the relationship between the content and functions of exercise imagery. Overall, this study represented a descriptive basis for research in exercise imagery by using grounded theory analysis and the development of a conceptual framework.

AB - The quest for greatness has driven many athletes and coaches to push for unfair advantages by the use of performance-enhancing (ergogenic) drugs, commonly referred to as "doping". The use of pharmacologically active substances to improve performance in work or sports goes back centuries, but has increased dramatically after the second world war, leading to a development of a "black market" of steroids and anabolics. In sports, doping refers to the use of performance-enhancing drugs, particularly those forbidden by organizations that regulate competitions. The medical community plays a crucial role in the fight against doping. The doctors owe to inform athletes about the painful and dangerous effects of doping substances in physical and mental health, as well as about their psychotropic action. Medical professionals owe to support education and awareness-raising programmes, since sufficient knowledge and training could be the first step in the fight against doping. Before its too late for many athlete lives, the medical community in collaboration with sports organizations and state institutions is compelled to take action against doping with increased awareness, to contribute in prevention and repression of this new medical and social problem. At first stage measures to prohibit the availability of performance enhancing drugs, including measures against trafficking are considered essential.

AB - Objectives: This paper describes the development and preliminary evaluation of the Australian football Mental Toughness Inventory (AfMTI). Methods: Confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses were employed to explore the factor structure of a pool of items designed to capture the key components of mental toughness in Australian football [Gucciardi, D.F., Gordon, S., & Dimmock, J.A. (2008). Towards an understanding of mental toughness in Australian football. Journal of Applied Sport Psychology, 20 , 261–281.] Correlations between the four-factor inventory and flow, resilience, and social desirability were examined. The discriminant validity of the inventory was also assessed. Multisource ratings (self, parent, and coach) of the AfMTI were examined in experiment two. Results: The AfMTI is a 24-item scale that measures four components of mental toughness in Australian football – thrive through challenge, sport awareness, tough attitude, and desire success. It was shown to have adequate internal reliability estimates across different raters (α .70–.89). Moderate correlations with flow and resilience were evidenced, while minimal correlations existed with social desirability. Multisource data were somewhat equivocal; correlational data suggested a disagreement between raters, whereas an ANOVA suggested agreement between raters. Conclusions: Preliminary data on the factor structure, internal reliability, and construct validity of the AfMTI were encouraging. However, the factor structure, reliability, and validity of the AfMTI must be verified through further psychometric examinations before it can be considered a useful tool for measuring mental toughness in Australian football.

AB - This volume in the Handbook of Sports Medicine and Science series presents a concise summary of the science and practice of psychology in the context of sport. Psychological aspects central to sport performance such as motivation, cognition, stress, confidence, and mental preparation are examined and interventions designed to enhance individual and team performance are reviewed. Reflecting the breadth of the field, issues such as sport injury prevention and rehabilitation, athlete psychopathology, child and adolescent development, sport career termination, and the practice of sport psychology are also addressed. Published under the auspices of the Medical Commission of the International Olympic Committee, Sport Psychology shows how the performance and the overall well-being of athletes can be improved by highlighting research findings and their practical application. With contributions from internationally renowned experts and useful case studies in each chapter, this handbook is an essential resource for medical doctors who serve athletes and sports teams and an invaluable reference for all students of sport psychology.

AB - What makes expert performance different from novice skill execution? In the current chapter, we focus our attention on the mental simulation of action in an attempt to shed light on expertise differences in action perception, representation, and production. Such knowledge not only informs the question of what makes an expert different from his or her novice counterpart but also makes salient the robust and widespread influence that mental simulation has on our understanding and representation of information we encounter—even in situations in which individuals have no intention to act. We begin by drawing on the literature in sport psychology, motor learning and control, and cognitive neuroscience to explore how the explicit ability to mentally simulate one's own action might differ as a function of one's motor skill level. This type of mental simulation is often termed motor imagery and has been defined as reenacting movements without overt execution. We next turn to recent work in cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience investigating how the perception of stimuli in one's environment can prompt automatic and covert mental simulation of action in the perceiver—even though the perceiver has no intention to act. This type of simulation, often termed motor resonance, is the process by which action observation activates the same neural substrates as those recruited when a perceiver performs an action by themselves. The idea that both observing and planning actions share a common neural substrate suggests that merely thinking about action may call on motor-based neural processes. That is, higher-level cognitive processes not directly involved in motor production such as language comprehension may be rooted in the mental simulation of action. We ask how this may differ as a function of one's expertise performing the action in question. Together, the work presented in this chapter suggests that a complete understanding of high-level performance not only requires consideration of on-line performance differences across the learning continuum, but also consideration of skill-level differences in the off-line mental simulation of action.

AB - One of the most studied and frequently cited areas within the field of applied sport psychology is that of competition stress and anxiety. This prominence is undoubtedly linked to the stressful nature of elite sport, and the demands associated with the competitive environments that surround the modem day performer. As a direct consequence, a core component within many athletes' competitive preparation programs includes some form of stress management focused on the achievement of an optimal pre-performance mental state. This chapter, which contains six sections, attempts to explore these programs and provides an insight into treatment frameworks that underpin practical work with elite athletes. The opening section clarifies and places into context the key terms used within this area and outlines their importance for applied work. The second section provides an overview of the stressors (i.e., demands) that performers commonly encounter, and illustrates the types of anxiety responses athletes may experience following exposure to these demands. The third section summarizes contemporary thinking on how sport psychologists believe anxiety can affect sport performance, and also illustrates how practitioners may attempt to evaluate the athlete before recommending an intervention strategy. The fourth section provides an overview of stress management interventions in elite sport that have been designed to reduce the intensity of anxiety symptoms that performers commonly encounter in stressful situations. Section five then details an approach to combating stress that focuses on programs that are designed to restructure the performers' interpretations of anxiety symptoms from negative to positive. The concluding section highlights these treatment approaches with two case study scenarios. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)

AB - Confidence consistently appears as a key skill possessed by successful elite athletes, and international-level elite athletes have identified confidence as the most critical mental skill defining mental toughness. Knowing this, elite athletes have stated that the development and maintenance of confidence is one of their biggest needs in mental training. This is because along with its importance as a mental skill critical to sport performance, another defining characteristic of confidence is its fragility. The fact that confidence in sport is so important, and yet so fragile, makes it an intriguing topic in sport psychology. Along with self-confidence, role, team, and coach confidence are examined in this chapter. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(create)

AB - Athletes and coaches constantly talk about mental preparation, psyching up, getting their game face on, and getting emotionally prepared to perform. Discussed less often, but of equal importance, is mental preparation for practices. In fact, recent research has shown that top athletes and coaches not only focus on the best ways to mentally ready themselves for competitions, but also for routine training sessions. Given the emphasis athletes and coaches place on mental preparation, it is not surprising that sport psychology researchers have been highly interested in the topic. Their research has shown that mental preparation is critical for sport success for both individual athletes and teams. Although mental preparation is often discussed by athletes and coaches as being critically important, optimal strategies for mental preparation are typically left to trial and error learning. However, with the growth and acceptance of applied sport psychology, more emphasis is being placed on purposefully instructing athletes and teams on optimal ways to mentally prepare. This chapter is designed to summarize what is known about effective mental preparation for athletes and teams. Guidelines for effective mental preparation are also forwarded. The chapter concludes with a series of case studies demonstrating how individual athletes and teams mentally prepare for peak performance in both training and competition.

AB - Despite the pioneering endeavors of Norman Triplett, Coleman Griffith, and others in applying psychology to sport performance, for many years the traditional conceptualization of psychologists in the context of sport was as mental health providers. Over the past few decades, the role of psychologists in sport has expanded considerably, particularly with respect to the delivery of performance enhancement services to teams and individual athletes. Nevertheless, addressing clinical concerns with athletes has remained an important, albeit less visible, aspect of sport psychology service delivery. The need for athletes to receive attention from a clinical practitioner frequently, but not always, coincides with the presence of diagnosable psychopathology. In general, clinical issues emerge when athletes encounter substantial psychological distress, behave in a manner that deviates from the prevailing norms of the social and cultural context in which they live, experience impairment in their ability to carry out tasks of daily living, or constitute a danger to themselves or other people. Although the common conception of athletes is one of the high-functioning individuals, athletes are nonetheless susceptible to the same sorts of psychological problems encountered by the general population. Indeed, even though involvement in vigorous physical activity characteristic of sport participation is often associated with favorable mental health outcomes, athletes are exposed to situational and environmental pressures that can heighten their vulnerability to certain forms of psychopathology. The purpose of this chapter is to review some of the mental disorders commonly experienced by athletes and discuss matters specific to the diagnosis, referral, and treatment of athletes with issues warranting the attention of a clinical practitioner.

AB - Introduction: Most research on doping behaviors in sportsmen is relative to professionals. However, high-risk behaviors can also be observed in amateur sportsmen. Exercise dependence corresponds to an unsuitable practice of physical exercise which leads to complications characterized by a need to increase the amount of exercise significantly, the presence of tiredness or anxiety when discontinuing the exercise, the loss of control, the increase in the time spent in exercises, the restriction of other fields of activity and the maintenance of the exercise even with a recurring physical or mental problem (Veale, 1995). It appears that exercise dependent subjects have specific representations of physical activity (Davis et al. 1993, 1995). Our objective is to study the relationship between doping practices and behavioral dependence to physical exercise in amateur sportsmen. We hypothesize that high-risk doping amateur sportsmen have the following specific profile: A threshold of consumption of physical exercises, a particular representation of the sport, a restriction of the fields of activities apart from the sport. Method: Mental representations and physical exercise habits of 317 semi-marathon runners were studied through semi-structured interviews. The sample consisted of 257 men and 60 women 20 to 60 years old. (i.e. 62 individuals from 20 to 30 years old, 116 from 30 to 40, 93 from 40 to 50, and 46 over 50 years old). All the participants were amateurs practicing foot racing in competition as principal sport. The participants were asked to answer to a self-questionnaire assessing: Their relation to physical activities, the number of hours of weekly physical exercises, the type of practice, the environment extra-sportsman, the representations of the sport, the importance given to the practice of the sport, the consumption of other products, the possibility of a consumption of doping products, their capacity to be abstinent to their physical activity. We determined an indicator of risk of doping, from different questions related to a possibility of consuming doping products. The indicator which appears most sensitive is the question: "Would you be ready to take doping products under medical control". Results: The majority (75%) of the semi-marathonians practice their physical activity between 1 and 5 hours weekly whatever their age. The median observed is equal to 4. A discriminating analysis does not make it possible to show a good capacity of classification of the individuals saying it self ready to take doping products under medical control according to the only criterion of the number of hours of physical practice. 11.7% of the subjects reported that they would agree to take doping substances if they had the opportunity to do so under medical control. The mental representations and behavioral characteristics of this subgroup are the following: 1) A pervasive search of a surpassing of themselves through physical exercise; 2) An every day life predominantly focused on physical exercise; 3) The onset of negative feelings and irritability related to exercise discontinuation; 4) Paradoxically, a moderate amount of time spent exercising (59.5% reported exercising less than 5 hours weekly). Discussion: In amateur sportsmen, the reported propensity to use doping substances is not correlated to the intensity of physical exercise measured by the amount of time weekly spent exercising. This propensity seems to occur in a specific sub-population of vulnerable subjects characterized by a behavioral dependence to physical exercise with a specific representation of their physical activity. These specific characteristics of high-risk individuals are independent from the age of the subjects. In a perspective of prevention, it is important to identify high-risk subjects to modify their manner of perceiving the sport, and to preserve other social investments.

AB - Regular exercise is associated with better mental health. This association is widely assumed to reflect causal effects of exercise. In this paper we propose that two additional mechanisms contribute to the association between exercise and mental health in the population-at-large: genetic pleiotropy and gene-by-exercise interaction. Both mechanisms assume heritability of exercise behavior and a partial overlap between the genes influencing exercise behavior and mental health. We review a number of large-scale studies in monozygotic and dizygotic twins that support these assumptions. Based on the importance of genetic factors in exercise behavior we develop a model for gene-by-exercise interaction that explains differences in voluntary exercise behavior by differential genetic sensitivity to the mental health benefits of exercise. We focus on the genetic modulation of acute mood effects of exercise and longer-term effects on self-esteem through genetic effects on exercise ability. If correct, our model calls for a change from ‘population-based’ to ‘personalized’ intervention strategies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - Social support is important for people experiencing serious mental illness and is also important during the initiation and maintenance of exercise. In this article we draw on interpretive research into the experiences of 11 men with serious mental illness to explore four dimensions of social support, both for and through exercise. Our findings suggest that informational, tangible, esteem, and emotional support were both provided for and given by participants through exercise. We conclude that experiences of both receiving and giving diverse forms of support in this way are significant for some people living with and recovering from serious mental illness.

AB - Objectives: The goal of this article is to better understand the use of mental imagery by athletes. Design: Exploratory qualitative study followed by interviews with multimedia assessment tool. Method: A first qualitative study was completed with two expert skydivers. The model obtained by the first study was tested in a second quantitative study with 32 skydivers. A multimedia tool was programmed to test the model so that films representing various content (internal or external views), characteristics (e.g., speed) and functions (e.g., to learn, to manage stress) was displayed during interviews in the second study. Results: Results of the first study suggested that the use of imagery can be functionally explained by three related elements: content (what is visualized), characteristics (how it is visualized) and functions (why it is visualized) of mental images. Results of the second study showed that the content and the characteristics of imagery are linked to the function sought. Moreover, we found that the mental images used (content, characteristics and functions) varied according to the level of expertise (novice, confirmed or experts) and with the situation (when preparing for the jump, before jumping out of the plane or after the jump). Conclusions: These results supplement the current stream of study, which has emphasized structural description of mental imagery since 1985. Our findings suggest that future research should build on structural dimensions of mental imagery and examine functional issues, because functional aspects have proved useful for understanding imagery use and for counseling athletes.

AB - During the Athens Olympic Games in 2004, a sports psychologist was brought in by the Brazilian Olympic Committee (COB) to provide psychological counseling. The main purposes of this counseling were to develop mental and emotional control skills and to offer psychological support to both athletes and coaches. The Brazilian sport psychologists in the Olympic Village offered interventions to individuals and teams. The following issues were uncovered by psychological tests and structured interviews: competitive anxiety, symptoms of psychosomatic stress, psychological pressure for winning, concentration difficulties, emotional instability, and difficulties in controlling pain. In order to prepare themselves for competition, some athletes developed their own psychological routines, aiming to maintain emotional control and a certain concentration level during the execution of technical-tactical gestures. A total of 50 sessions of psychological support and supervision took place throughout the entire event, among which relaxation, concentration techniques, anxiety and stress management, and psychological routines for competition were practiced. Future steps for the Olympic games in 2008 are a long-term preparation program, an interdisciplinary cooperation involving mental preparation (mainly for young athletes), and the development of a coach's education program.

AB - Recent studies using neuroimaging technologies offer evidence that ancient beliefs about the benefits (e.g., enhanced attention, increased distress tolerance) associated with mindfulness practice and other forms of meditation may be supported by identifiable neuroanatomical changes in the brain. Although it is too early to make probative statements regarding exactly how and why contemplative practices affect the structure and activity of the brain, sport psychologists may want to consider the potential implications of the findings that have begun to emerge from this neural correlates research. The goal of this article is to (a) review the findings from the principal studies of contemplative practice that have employed measures of neuronal activity (e.g., fMRI, EEG) and (b) examine the potential relevance of these studies to the treatment of psychological disorders among athletes and the enhancement of athletic performance.

AB - Objectives: It has been suggested that mental illness threatens identity and sense of self when one's personal story is displaced by dominant illness narratives focussing on deficit and dysfunction. One role of therapy, therefore, is to allow individuals to re-story their life in a more positive way which facilitates the reconstruction of a meaningful identity and sense of self. This research explores the ways in which involvement in sport and exercise may play a part in this process. Design: Qualitative analysis of narrative. Method: We used an interpretive approach which included semi-structured interviews and participant observation with 11 men with serious mental illness to gather stories of participants' sport and exercise experiences. We conducted an analysis of narrative to explore the more general narrative types which were evident in participants' accounts. Findings: We identified three narrative types underlying participants' talk about sport and exercise: (a) an action narrative about "going places and doing stuff"; (b) an achievement narrative about accomplishment through effort, skill or courage; (c) a relationship narrative of shared experiences to talk about combined with opportunities to talk about those experiences. We note that these narrative types differ significantly from--and may be considered alternatives to--dominant illness narratives. Conclusion: This study provides an alternative perspective on how sport and exercise can help men with serious mental illness by providing the narrative resources which enabled participants to re-story aspects of their lives through creating and sharing personal stories through which they rebuilt or maintained a positive sense of self and identity.

AB - Objectives: Muscle dysmorphia (MD) is a preoccupation with the idea that one's body is insufficiently lean and muscular and considered as a body image disorder in men. This study aimed to investigate the relationship of MD with childhood bullying victimization experiences and mental health problems in a nonclinical sample of male bodybuilders. Design: A cross-sectional study was conducted with a sample of 100 male bodybuilders. Methods: Participants completed a questionnaire battery consisting of the muscle dysmorphic inventory (MDI), and scales on childhood bullying victimization, self-esteem, and psychological problems including depression, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms. Results: High scores on the MDI and bullying victimization in childhood predicted global psychopathology and low self-esteem. Psychological functioning and self-esteem were most strongly adversely affected if the men were victims of bullying and scored high on the MDI (significant moderation effect). Structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses furthermore found an indirect linkage of victimization with global psychopathology and self-esteem via MDI (mediation effect). Conclusions: Childhood bullying victimization and MD are strongly associated with concurrent anxiety, depressive and obsessive-compulsive symptoms and low self-esteem.

AB - This study compared physical education (PE) and recess in two markedly different special schools for children with mild intellectual disabilities; one school had a reputation for focusing on sports (High Sport Focus-HSF) and the other did not (Low Sport Focus-LSF). Data were collected in 24 PE classes and 48 recess periods using a validated observation system. During both PE and recess, HSF students engaged in physical activity (PA) at greater intensity levels, but LSF students accrued more total activity min. Differences in PA during PE between the schools were associated with both lesson context and teacher behavior. The results suggest written (e.g., scheduling) and unwritten policies within schools affect children’s activity levels. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - Despite continuing interest in the physical activity-mental health relationship, few studies have recently been published concerning the effects of exercise for men with serious mental illness. This study helps fill this gap through an interpretive approach that explores how sport and exercise can contribute to recovery from mental illness. Case studies of two men's experiences are presented that illustrate two distinct roles sport and exercise can play. In the first case, sport and exercise are central to the participant's identity and fundamental to his sense of self. For this individual, returning to sport and exercise following remission of psychotic symptoms represents a return to intrinsically meaningful activities. In the second case, sport and exercise are used as a tool or vehicle for desired outcomes that facilitate personally meaningful vocational activities. For this individual, sport and exercise represent a fresh start and a worthwhile use of time. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - A personal construct psychology (PCP; Kelly, 1955/1991) framework was employed in an attempt to reveal a holistic understanding of mental toughness in the context of Australian Football. Eleven male coaches (M age = 42, SD = 9.62) with considerable playing and coaching experience at the elite level were interviewed using a PCP-based interview protocol. Transcribed verbatim data were analyzed using grounded theory procedures. Three independent categories (characteristics, situations, behaviors) were inductively derived and integrated into a model in which the importance of understanding each component individually was emphasized. The relationship between these three central categories was also highlighted. Results identified the key mental characteristics and their contrasts together with those situations that demand mental toughness, and the behaviors commonly displayed by mentally tough footballers. Conceptualized in the context of these three categories, mental toughness in Australian Football can be considered as a buffer against adversity but also as a collection of enabling factors that promote and maintain adaptation to other challenging situations. Practical implications of the findings are discussed and focus on issues pertaining to enhancing and/or developing mental toughness.

AB - Background: Physical activity among adolescents and its implications for health status is of increasing concern. We examined trends in physical activity and participation in sports clubs among Icelandic adolescents. Methods: Cross-sectional survey data were used to determine levels of vigorous physical activity and participation in sports clubs (defined as engaging in moderately intensive activity four times or more a week) for cohorts of Icelandic adolescents in 1992, 1997, 2000 and 2006. Results: There was a 6% increase in the rate of vigorous physical activity and a 15% increase in active sports club participation among 14- and 15-year old Icelandic adolescents from 1992 to 2006. The trends were consistent across genders; however, only 53% of boys actually achieved the recommended criterion for vigorous physical activity, with the percentage of girls averaging 16% lower than that for boys. Additionally, there was an overall increase in the proportion of inactive adolescents, with girls consistently reporting higher levels of inactivity than boys even though the net increase in inactivity was higher for boys. Conclusion: Although our results show an overall increase in vigorous physical activity and participation in sports clubs over the past decade among both genders, our data also indicate that over half of all Icelandic adolescents are not achieving the recommended level of participation in physical activity. Furthermore, less than one third of the population studied is achieving the recommended level of activity through organized clubs. Initiatives to increase physical activity among the least active of adolescents should receive high priority in public health.

AB - Like the sports medicine physician, the sport psychiatrist plays an important role in the sports medicine team (SMT). A specialist in diagnosing emotional disorders can increase the diagnostic and treatment capabilities of the SMT. The goal of this article is to increase awareness of the psychiatric disorders commonly occurring among athletes and highlight the value of accurate psychiatric diagnosis. Using vignettes involving established athletes, the article examines anxiety and mood disorders, eating disorders, substance use disorders, and attention deficit disorder as they occur in athletic settings, as well as other syndromes with particular relevance to athletes, such as over training and post concussion syndrome. Other clinical issues encountered while working with athletes, including learning disabilities and career termination concerns, are also discussed. Finally, the basic concepts of transference and counter-transference are reviewed to highlight important relational dynamics between the athlete and the SMT.

AB - Retrospective perceptions and causal beliefs regarding the temporal patterning of precompetitive psychological responses were examined in 12 elite rugby union players. Composite sequence analysis resulted in a series of temporal networks to describe participants’ cognitive, affective, and behavioural responses in a time-to-event paradigm. Match-related cognitions remained stable in the lead up to competition, while perceptions of physical symptoms peaked at the onset of performance. Affective responses were associated with feelings of anxiety and tension in the early temporal phases but excitement, confidence, and efficacy in team-mates directly before competition. Behavioural themes described activities associated with technical and physical preparation, familiarization with environmental conditions, and strategies to control activation states early on or directly before competition. The findings highlight the idiosyncratic and dynamic nature of the temporal patterning of precompetitive responses and the influence that perceptions of the team have upon individual preparation for performance. Implications are discussed in the context of the type and timing of intervention for developing individual and team preparatory routines.

AB - Reviews the book, In Pursuit of Excellence: How to Win in Sport and Life Through Mental Training (4th Ed) by Terry Orlick (see record 2007-18055-000). Terry Orlick's experience over the last 35 years as a leader in applied sport psychology and performance excellence provides the backdrop for this latest edition. The book provides new insights, stories, and an updated step-by-step plan for readers to develop their own personal path to excellence in whatever domain they may choose. It will assist readers in learning to focus for excellence and high-quality living, develop a more positive outlook on life, help develop a more focused commitment, assist in dealing with distractions, help create strategies for overcoming obstacles, allow one to experience greater personal and professional satisfaction, facilitate working better with teammates, and responding more effectively to coaching, and enable one to become more self-directed. The beauty of this book (like its earlier predecessors) lies in its simplicity of application to the individual - use those elements that you perceive you need, and leave the rest for another time or situation. It is a valuable addition to any sport psychology library. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Context: Psychological skills are alleged to augment sport-injury rehabilitation; however, implementation of mental imagery within rehabilitation programs is limited. Objective: To examine attitudes of athletic trainers (ATs) and physical therapists (PTs) on the effectiveness of mental imagery, goal setting, and positive self-talk to improve rehabilitation adherence and recovery speed of injured athletes. Design: The ATs and PTs were contacted via electronic or physical mailings to complete a single administration survey that measured their beliefs about the effectiveness of psychological skills for increasing adherence and recovery speed of injured athletes undergoing rehabilitation. Setting: Professional member databases of the National Athletic Trainers' Association and the American Physical Therapy Association. Patients or Other Participants: Of the 1000 ATs and 1000 PTs who were selected randomly, 309 ATs (age = 34.18 ± 8.32 years, years in profession = 10.67 ± 7.34) and 356 PTs (age = 38.58 ± 7.51 years, years in profession = 13.18 ± 6.17) responded. Main Outcome Measure(s): The Attitudes About Imagery (AAI) survey measures attitudes about psychological skills for enhancing adherence and recovery speed of injured athletes. The AAI includes demographic questions and 15 items on a 7-point Likert scale measuring attitudes about the effectiveness of mental imagery, self-talk, goal setting, and pain control on rehabilitation adherence and recovery speed of injured athletes. Test-retest reliability ranged from .60 to .84 and Cronbach αs ranged from .65 to .90. We calculated 1-way analyses of variance to determine whether differences existed in attitudes as a result of the professionals' education, training experience, and interest. Results: Mean differences were found on attitudes about effectiveness of psychological skills for those who reported formal training and those who reported interest in receiving formal training (P < .05). In addition, ATs held more positive attitudes than PTs on 9 of 15 AAI items (P < .05). Conclusions: Overall, ATs and PTs held positive attitudes on the effectiveness of psychological skills to augment the rehabilitation process. Clinical implications regarding the use of mental skills are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - Over the past two decades, mental skills training (MST) has experienced a tremendous surge in popularity, yet MST is not without its critics, including some athletes and coaches. Additionally, a number of concerns have arisen about mental training effectiveness, and its ability to maximize athlete development, performance, and peaking. Periodization is a systematic program development and implementation strategy that holds promise for enhancing mental training effectiveness and combating some of the problems currently limiting MST interventions. Thus, the purpose of this conceptual paper was threefold. First, periodization concepts are introduced by demonstrating how they are utilized to systematically guide physical training. Second, strategies to adapt periodization concepts to enhance mental training programs are examined, along with techniques to integrate physical and mental training, including: mental training tool and skill periodization plans and mental training drill menus. Finally, a case study is presented to illustrate how an integrated approach to periodized training that targets both physical and mental skill development can enhance the effectiveness of MST while minimizing implementation problems.

AB - Context: The assessment of an individual's mental toughness would assist clinicians in enhancing an individual's performance, improving compliance with the rehabilitation program, and improving the individual treatment program. However, no sound measure of mental toughness exists. Objective: To develop a new measure of mental toughness, the Mental, Emotional, and Bodily Toughness Inventory (MeBTough). Design: Participants were invited to complete a 45-item questionnaire. Setting: University research laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 261 undergraduate students were recruited to complete the questionnaire. Main Outcome Measure(s): The Rasch-calibrated item difficulties, fit statistics, and persons' mental toughness ability estimates were examined for model-data fit of the MeBTough. Results: Forty-three of the 45 items had good model-data fit with acceptable fit statistics. Results indicated that the distribution of items was fittingly targeted to the people and the collapsed rating scale functioned well. The item separation index (6.31) and separation reliability statistic (.98) provided evidence that the items had good variability with a high degree of confidence in replicating placement of the items from another sample. Conclusions: Results provided support for using the new measure of mental, emotional, and bodily toughness. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

The instruments included Averill Emotional Creativity Inventory, the Endler and Parker Coping Inventory for Stressful Situation and the Goldberg General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). Results showed that the mean scores of mental health, emotional creativity, task oriented coping, and avoidances-oriented coping of the female athlete students were significantly different from the female non-athlete students. However there was no significant difference between the athlete and non-athlete students in their emotional oriented coping. The only predictor variable concerning the mental health in the non-athlete students was the avoidance oriented coping. In the athlete students, although, avoidance-oriented coping was a predictor variable on mental health in the first step but in the second step, the avoidance-oriented coping and emotional oriented coping were significant predictors of mental health. The emotional creativity of the non-athlete and athlete students was not a significant predictor of their mental health.

AB - Ballroom dance has resurfaced worldwide as a highly popular competitive sport and might be added to Olympic medal competition for the 2012 London Games. This resurgence presents opportunities for sport psychologists to provide psychological-skills and performance-enhancement training for ballroom dancers at all competitive levels. Few sport psychologists have the personal experience, expertise, or an adequate knowledge base about the competitive-ballroom-dance environment to provide meaningful intervention strategies for participants. This article was developed to provide initial guidance for sport psychology professionals interested in working in this environment. An overview of the competitive-dance and ballroom-dance environment, strategies used by dance couples for enhanced mental preparation before and during dance competitions, and excerpts from an interview with an Australian championship-level couple provide readers insight into performance-enhancement strategies for DanceSport.

The subject sample was drawn from the population of 13-24 year-old female patients presenting for initial assessment at Park Nicollet's Eating Disorders Institute and Mayo Clinic's outpatient eating disorders program. Patients who provided informed consent were grouped according to the type of formal athletic program in which they participate or placed into the non-athlete group. The non-athlete group was comprised of those subjects who do not participate in formal sport program. The data were collected and analyzed for between group differences as assessed by: the Eating Disorders Inventory-II (EDI-II; subscales measuring drive for thinness, body dissatisfaction, ineffectiveness, perfectionism, interoceptive awareness); the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II; raw scores): the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI; state and trait anxiety raw scores); current body mass index (BMI), menstrual status, self reported age of onset, duration of disordered eating, and hours of exercise per day/week. Of the scales and measures studied for between group differences six variables were shown to be at significant levels. Non-athletes age was older than the athletic counterparts, non-athletes had longer durations of eating disorders, aesthetic athletes reported more exercise per day while endurance athletes reported more exercise per week, and endurance athletes also reported higher incidence interrupted and lower normal menses.

AB - This qualitative phenomenological study was conducted to try to discover the motivations that cause stress as experienced by older athletes returning to sport after a knee injury. In addition, intrinsic or extrinsic motivation may aid or abrogate the return to sport. Does fear of re-injury impede the older athletes' return to sport? These are only some of the questions evolving which this research addressed. The method of data collection consisted of one-on-one interviews. A triangulation of data was also incorporated into the interview. This triangulation of data gathered and transcribed using written notes, video and audio tapes. A phenomenological model was the format for the interviews. However, to keep from influencing the answers questions were modified and refined for this particular study. Qualitative analysis began with the first data analysis step referred to as the Epoche. The Epoche is a self analysis of the researcher to assure the avoidance of personal bias. The completion of the data was analyzed using a revised five step model for this research. Six male participants over the age of 50 were finally selected from a population supplied by an orthopedic surgeon. The participants were golfers, who had knee joint replacement, ample time for intervention and recovery, and had been released physiologically for return to sport. The time of recovery was also recorded along with the rest of the demographics. The participants depended on their athletic ability for social interaction with their peers. However, there were those who returned to play and those who did not. For the purpose of this study only those who did not return to sport were interviewed. The purpose of this research was to determine reasons for this behavioral difference in older men who golf for the intrinsic value. Based on past data, and this research's analyzed data, the theme that emerged reflected the participants' experiences during the phase of stress that includes preparation, transition, and adaptation. Stressors and obstacles were documented in relation to the themes. The themes served to answer the research questions of this study for the purpose of contributing to the psychology of sport.

AB - Research independently examining athletic identity and aggressive sport behavior is quite extensive; however, the relationship between these variables has yet to be explored. Findings from the sport fandom literature regarding team identification and aggressive fan behavior provides a foundation on which to hypothesize about the potential role athletic identity may have in the expression of athlete aggression. Therefore, the purposes of the study were to: (a) further explore the utility and psychometric properties of the Athletic Identity Measurement Scale (AIMS) and the Competitive Aggressiveness and Anger Scale (CAAS), (b) examine the relationships between athletic identity, anger, and aggression in competitive athletes, (c) assess cross-cultural differences, and (d) test hypothesized pathways between variables predicted to contribute to sport aggression. A total of 569 male athletes participating in contact and collision sports in the United States (n = 362) and Hong Kong (n = 207) completed the AIMS, CAAS, and a modified version of the Context Modified Webb Scale. Results of the study showed support for future use of the AIMS and CAAS as sound measures of athletic identity, anger, and aggressiveness in both American and English-speaking Hong Kong Chinese athlete populations. Results also indicated small to moderate positive relationships between athletic identity, anger, and aggressiveness with differences in those variables found with respect to sport type (contact versus collision) and culture. Interestingly, group comparisons yielded significant differences between highly identified and lowly identified athletes in both anger and aggressiveness. Path analyses examined the influence of years of sport participation, perceived athletic ability, athletic identity, professionalization, and anger in aggressive sport behavior. Lastly, results indicated a good fit between the data and the proposed theoretical model accounting for 43.1% of the total variance in aggressiveness in American athletes and 56.5% of the variance in Hong Kong athletes.

AB - The current study examines the existence of the double dose message of slimness among adolescent body-leanness and non body-leanness female athletes in which internalization of a slim sport-specific ideal combined with a willingness to work to achieve the ultra-slim societal ideal impact the development of disordered eating. Potential origins of pressure within the microsystem of the sport are examined. The relationship between disordered eating and general familial boundary violations along with parental involvement in subculture of the sport is also examined. Using a body figures rating scale, 92 committed adolescent female athletes were asked to identify their ideal body figure, along with the ideal they perceive to be promoted by society, their sport, and their parents. Participants also completed self-report measures examining disordered eating, self-esteem, perfectionism, body dissatisfaction, and sociocultural attitudes towards appearance. Athletes were surveyed on the degree of pressure to achieve the sport-specific ideal they felt from coaches, teammates, parents, and themselves. Athletes also completed self-report questionnaires examining parental enmeshment and intrusion, as well as parental involvement in their athletic subculture. Eighty-nine mothers and 38 fathers also completed a modified body figures rating scale and self-report questionnaire regarding their own boundary issues with their athlete daughter and their involvement in their daughter's athletics. Results indicate that a double dose message of slimness does exist in which microsystemic and mesosystemic influences are associated with higher levels of disordered eating. While body-leanness athletes endorsed a significantly slimmer ideal for themselves, their sport, and their parents, no group differences on eating measures emerged. This suggests that the double dose message is based partially on an athlete's perceived sport-specific ideal, regardless of group membership. While the combined pressure from coaches and teammates accounted for variance in internalization of the sport-specific ideal, athletes' internallydriven pressure based on body comparisons accounted for the most variance. While perceived pressure from parents was not a significant factor in achieving the sportspecific ideal, maternal enmeshment as well as negative and positive involvement in the subculture of the sport was related to disordered eating.

AB - The study sought to examine the differential effects of a Stress Management Training on the anxiety, self-esteem, self-efficacy, motivation, academic performance, and coping skills for collegiate football athletes. It was hypothesized the Stress Management Training would have a positive effect on outcomes. The study was conducted using collegiate football athletes at a large urban university. Eighty-five collegiate football athletes participated, and data was analyzed on 81 of the student athletes. Participants' anxiety was measured by the Sport Anxiety Scale-2 (SAS-2, Smith et al., 2005); self-esteem was measured using the Culture-Free Self-Esteem Inventories (CFSEI-2, Battle, 1992); self-efficacy using the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE, Schwarzer & Jersualem, 1995); motivation was measured using the Student Athletes' Motivation toward Sports and Academics Questionnaire (SAMSAQ, Gaston, 2002); and coping skills was assessed with the Athletic Coping Skills Inventory (ACI-28 Smith et al., 1998). Participant's pre-and-post honor point average (HPA) was obtained from their individual transcripts. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups (Experimental Group Stress Management Training or Control Group who did not receive any treatment). The experimental group participated in the three-hour Stress Management Training conducted by the researcher. The training was an experiential teaching program consisting of three modules of stress management strategies for collegiate football athletes. It included didactic information about stress and effects of stress on collegiate football athletes. Handouts, demonstrations, reading materials, and exercises were used and practiced during the semester. At the conclusion of the study (15 weeks), all participants completed the post-test criterion instruments to provide outcome data. Results indicated, although the mean differences moved in the expected direction, there were no statistically significant results found in anxiety, self-esteem, self-efficacy, motivation, academic performance and coping skills between groups.

AB - The present study explored biological and experiential factors contributing to individual differences in spatial ability by investigating performance differences relating to sex, athleticism, and 2D:AD ratios, a marker of fetal testosterone and estrogen levels, on allocentric and egocentric measures of spatial ability. Men were more accurate than women on a Shepard & Metzler-type mental rotation task and significantly faster when making right-left identifications of asymmetrical everyday objects (e.g., hands, shoes). There were no sex differences on the egocentric Semmes Body task, the body mental rotation task, or the Phonological and Semantic Verbal Fluency tasks. Men had significantly lower 2D:AD ratios than women, indicative of high fetal testosterone relative to low fetal estrogen. Among men, low 2D:AD ratios correlated with greater accuracy on the Right-Left Differentiation task, whereas high 2D:AD ratios (i.e., indicating low fetal testosterone relative to fetal estrogen) correlated with faster mental rotation speed, supporting assertions that fetal testosterone in the low male range is optimal for allocentric spatial ability. Among women, high 2D:AD ratios correlated with better performance on both verbal fluency tasks. While athletes were significantly more accurate when dealing with parts of their own bodies (Semmes Body task) and making right-left determinations, they were not better on either mental rotation task. Correlations between 2D:AD ratios and athletic achievement revealed that lower 2D:AD ratios correlated with a higher level of athletic achievement in both men and women. Our findings suggest that higher prenatal testosterone may be predictive of better athletic ability in both sexes and might be related to greater skill in activities requiring egocentric spatial transformations among men. Whether the improved spatial abilities are the result of increased athletic experiences or are aptitudes that lead individuals to pursue and excel in sports, remains for future investigation.

AB - The purpose of this study was to investigate the psychological profile of a race-car driver and the mental skills necessary to become competitive. In the past, research involving race car drivers employed personality-tests such as the Edwards Personal Preference Scale (EPPS) and the Minnesota Multiphasic Inventory (MPI), but neither measurement provided sufficient data on the mental traits and coping skills needed to be an accomplished driver. In addition, the MMPI is typically used as a tool for assessing psychopathology. Using a mental measurement from personality theory would allow the researcher the ability to focus on specific personality traits without the inclusion of psychopathological factors. Employing a sport specific measure from sport psychology would provide higher predictive validity than global specific counterparts. The Big Five Inventory (BFI) was used to determine the distribution of the big five personality factors among drivers. A mental measurement used in sport psychology, the Athletic Coping Skills Inventory-28 (ASCI-28) was used to assess the coping skills of drivers from novice to professional. Drivers from a national car club in Northern California as well as individuals from an online car website were selected and compared to a control group. The BFI revealed that race-car drivers were similar in personality types of resilients, although they scored lower in the agreeableness scale than the controls. In assessing scores of the ACSI-28, drivers scored significantly higher than the controls in all scales with the exception of the variable "freedom from worry," which indicated their high need for achievement in the sport. The results of these mental measurements concur with previous research on the personality of race-car drivers and furnished new insight on their coping skills.

AB - Sport psychology is a new yet growing subdiscipline in psychology that combines psychology, sport science, and medicine. The thoughts and beliefs of five sport psychologists that currently serve or have served on committees from American Psychological Association's (APA) Division 47 (Exercise and Sport) or Association for Applied Sport Psychology (AASP) were examined. Hill et al.'s (2005; 1997) Consensual Qualitative Research (CQR) methodology was utilized to analyze the data. Ethical challenges included maintaining confidentiality, managing boundaries, dual-roles, and maintaining competency. The APA Ethics Code was seen as flexible enough to be interpreted in sport psychology. Participants suggested sport psychology training programs should offer integrated training that includes clinical or counseling psychology, sport science, and sport psychology.

AB - The purpose of this study was to investigate high school girls' basketball coaches' attitudes toward sport psychology consultation. The Sport Psychology Attitudes Revised Coaches-2 (SPARC-2; Zakrajsek & Zizzi, 2007) was given to 110 high school girls' basketball coaches. A MANOVA and four ANOVAs were used to analyze gender against attitude (stigma tolerance, personal openness, confidence in sport psychology, and cultural preferences) toward sport psychology consultation. Pearson and Spearman correlations were used to analyze attitudes toward sport psychology against previous exposure to sport psychology. Results showed that there were no differences in male and female coaches' attitudes toward sport psychology consultation. Results also showed for previous exposure the number of times a sport psychology consultant worked with a team increased, a coach's cultural preference decreased. It also showed that as the level of formal training for coaches increased, stigma toward sport psychology consultation decreased. Sport psychology consultants must be aware that differences may be present when working with coaches and teams of different sports and levels of that sport.

AB - Sport performance is widely believed to depend on internal processes that occur during performance. Studies examining these processes have relied on retrospective self-reports obtained long after performance, a method limited by athletes' abilities to compete and recall. Our study circumvented these problems by obtaining contemporaneous non-retrospective reports of inner experience using Descriptive Experience Sampling (DES). DES uses a device that emits a random beep via an earpiece. Participants record ongoing inner experience immediately after the beep in a notebook. Within 24 hours participants are interviewed about these momentary experiences. Five highly-skilled (handicaps of between 2 and 7) and five moderately-skilled (handicaps between 13 and 26) golfers competed in an experimental tournament. DES was used to examine inner experience during golf. Golf inner experiences consisted of golf-related content, mental preparation strategies, perceptual awareness, and inner speech most prominently. Unsymbolized thinking, sensory awareness, feeling, and speaking aloud were also present. Inner experience during golf was also found to be individually different. Golf-related content and mental preparation strategies may be positively related to performance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of life events stress between injured and non-injured African American female collegiate athletes and its effects on anxiety. Specifically, this study examined the influence of the variables age, playing status, campus organization affiliation, and community organization affiliation. The Life Events Survey for Collegiate Athletes and the State Trait Anxiety Inventory were used to collect data for this investigation. The sample consisted of 50 participants from four National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division 1 Women's Basketball programs, in Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), located in the southern region of the United States. The Pearson Chi-Square Test was used to test the hypotheses formulated in the study. All hypotheses were tested at the .05 level. Fifteen hypotheses were tested in this investigation. Twelve significant differences were found between injured and non-injured African American female collegiate athletes experiencing life events stress and anxiety. The following recommendations are offered to assist counselors and other helping professionals with the emotional responses experienced by injured and non-injured African American female collegiate athletes. Sport psychologists and counselors should partner with the NCAA to track health through its Injury Surveillance System from a psychological perspective. The tracking would provide awareness of mental wellness and offer intervention strategies for injury reduction. Athletic personnel should receive professional development on coping strategies to utilize during injury rehabilitation programs. Finally, coaches should work closely with athletic trainers, conditioning coaches, sport psychologists, and counselors on implementing effective workouts that promote muscle recovery and stress management.

AB - Recent research has suggested that the effects of sport on well-being are mediated by psychological characteristics such as physical self-concept, instrumentality and positive body images; in addition, sport was found to be related to these psychological benefits for high school girls. However, physical self-concept played a central role by mediating the sport body image and sport instrumentality relationships. Positive body image and instrumentality, in turn, predicted greater psychological well-being. The purpose of this investigation was to replicate earlier studies, and to examine these relationships with non-sport physical activity. Sport and physical activity were expected to contribute to higher physical self-concept, which in turn, would contribute positively to instrumentality and body image. Further, instrumentality and body image would be positively related to psychological well-being. Participants were 355 9th (n = 170) and 10th (n = 193) graders and they completed measures of involvement in sport/physical activities, physical self-concept, instrumentality, body satisfaction, self-esteem, satisfaction with life, depression, and demographics. Structural equation modeling was utilized to analyze the data. Overall, for both sport and physical activity, the models fit the data well (sport model: NNFI=.95, CFI=.96, SRMR=.08, RMSEA=.09, physical activity model: NNFI=.96, CFI=.97, SRMR=.08, RMSEA=.09). Specifically, sport participation was positively related to physical self-concept (R2 = .47); physical self-concept related to body image (R2 = .30) and instrumentality (R2 = .23); Physical activity was positively related to physical self-concept (R 2 = .61); physical self-concept related to body image (R 2 = .30) and instrumentality (R2 = .26). For both models, positive body image and higher levels of instrumentality contributed to greater psychological well-being (R 2 = 66). These results highlight the importance of developing physical competence for high school girls through sport participation and physical activity.

AB - This dissertation has two purposes: (a) to identify the psychosocial competencies that are needed by certified athletic trainers; and (b) to evaluate whether these competencies can be taught to athletic training students (ATS). It includes an introduction (Chapter 1), a review of literature, (Chapter 2), two background studies (Chapter 3), the dissertation study (Chapter 4), and one comprehensive discussion (Chapter 5). The purpose of the two background studies contained in Chapter 3 was to identify the psychosocial competencies that are needed by certified athletic trainers (ATCs). This was accomplished through individual interviews with currently or previously injured college student-athletes and through focus group interviews with recently certified athletic trainers. Results of these two background studies were triangulated with information obtained from the review of literature (Chapter 2) to produce content to be included in athletic training education programs. The purpose of the main dissertation study (Chapter 4) was to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational module in teaching these competencies to athletic training students. Chapter 4 also contains a discussion of the development of two psychometrically sound questionnaires designed to measure the application and transfer of sport psychology knowledge and applied sport psychology techniques. Chapter 5 is dedicated to a discussion of the implications of the results of the studies contained within Chapter 3 and Chapter 4. In the primary dissertation study (Chapter 4), 31 athletic training students were assigned to an intervention versus a control condition and took part in six-week Applied Sport Psychology for Athletic Trainers (ASP-AT) educational module designed to increase proficiency in psychology of injury competencies. Assessments of psychology of injury knowledge and usage occurred at multiple occasions, extending 14 weeks post-intervention. Results indicated that the ASP-AT educational module is effective at increasing psychology of injury knowledge (increase of 31 points from baseline) and skill usage (increase of 44 points from baseline) in undergraduate and Masters degree candidate athletic training students. These increases were maintained at seven- and 14-week retention testing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - This study investigated the implementation of mental training applications with college athletes. The purpose of the experimental study was to examine the effects of an eight-week mental training program on athletes' anxiety adjustment, stress resistance, cardiovascular regulation, and visualization learning ability in soccer related contests. A total of 56 college soccer players, were randomly assigned to either the experimental or the control group. The athletes completed measurements of cardiovascular activity prior to juggling and shooting contests as well as in the recovery phase after the contests. Posttest measurements included cold pressor tests and questionnaires such as the Sport Competition Anxiety Test (SCAT), the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2 (CSAI-2), the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI-2) and the Recovery-Stress Questionnaire for Athletes (RESTQ-Sport). The findings suggest that the mental training program generated positive effects on athletes in terms of optimizing cardiovascular activity prior to and after contests (lowering heart rate and activating baroreceptor reflex mechanism) and improving juggling skills (59% improvement in touches and 45% enhancement in time) in comparison to the pretest measurements. One of the recommendations stresses the importance of deep breathing in sport performance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Purpose. The purpose of this study was to determine if podcasting can significantly increase FT shooting performance among high school basketball players. Methods. The sample for the study included 36 (12 male, 24 female) Oklahoma high school basketball players. Subjects were assigned into four groups (script, computer, iPod, control group) and were tested in three phases (pretest, treatment, posttest). The treatment phase consisted of imagery training (via podcasting) and FT shooting for six weeks. Results. A total of 200 FT shots for the experimental groups was analyzed and compared to a total of 50 FT shots for the control group. Surprisingly, there were no significant group differences found among the experimental groups at any of the six testing sessions. However, a comparison of group means and the grand mean for the six testing sessions did indicate that the iPod group (18.1) performed higher than the computer group (16.7) and the script group (16.2). Also, a one-way ANOVA of the posttest indicated that there were significant group mean differences [F (3, 32) = 3.221, p < .05, w = .40]. A Tukey post hoc test indicated that the true source of the significant group difference was between the iPod group and the control group. A comparison of posttest group means indicated that the iPod group (21.0) was the top performer, followed by the computer group (18.6), the script group (17.1), and the control group (15.8). Overall, the script group had the highest improvement (+ 3.8) and the control group had the lowest improvement (+ 0.7). Conclusion. Podcasting is a valid technological application of sport imagery that can improve FT shooting performance among high school basketball players. Podcasting is recommended as an adjunct to mental and physical training that can benefit sport psychologists, the coaching staff, and most importantly the athletes.

AB - The goal of the present study was to determine whether mental practice is an effective preparation for performing a forehand task in table tennis and whether mental practice is more effective with an external focus on the movement technique. Attentional focus studies suggest that when acquiring a goal-directed task involving the wielding of an implement, mental practice should be focused on an external effect of the movement directly related to the movement technique (e.g., the trajectory of the racket) rather than on a more distant effect, such as the anticipated trajectory of the ball. Results showed that the mental practice group that focused on the trajectory of the racket was more effective than the control group receiving the same scripts but not benefiting from a previous phase of mental practice. Also, mental practice on the trajectory of the racket was more effective than mental practice on the trajectory of the ball.

AB - This paper provides a review of the literature on the relationship between imagery and sport performance as well as between imagery and the development of mental skills. First, the many anecdotal reports of imagery effectiveness are noted and a definition is provided focusing on the multidimensional nature of imagery. The evidence of the enhancing influence of imagery on sport performance is then examined by looking at the early studies (mental practice), case studies, preparatory imagery, imagery used as part of a mental training package, and the use of imagery by successful athletes. After discussing the limitations in research imagery relating to performance, the focus turned to the relationship of imagery and the development of mental skills (e.g., confidence, dealing with pressure, motivation). Factors affecting imagery effectiveness were highlighted including imagery perspective, type of task, positive versus negative imagery, and timing of imagery. The paper concluded with future directions for research including such areas as amount of time to image, imagery and children, imagery ability, and imagery and performance expertise.

AB - Seven participants from a previous study (Jones, Hanton, & Connaughton, 2002) agreed to be interviewed about the development of mental toughness. We also aimed to determine whether mental toughness requires maintenance . Semistructured interviews were conducted to elicit the participants' perceptions of how mental toughness is cultivated and retained. Findings indicated that the development of mental toughness is a long-term process that encompasses a multitude of underlying mechanisms that operate in a combined, rather than independent, fashion. In general, these perceived underlying mechanisms related to many features associated with a motivational climate (e.g. enjoyment, mastery), various individuals (i.e. coaches, peers, parents, grandparents, siblings, senior athletes, sport psychologists, team-mates), experiences in and outside sport, psychological skills and strategies, and an insatiable desire and internalized motives to succeed. It was also reported that once mental toughness had been developed, three perceived underlying mechanisms were required to maintain this construct: a desire and motivation to succeed that was insatiable and internalized, a support network that included sporting and non-sporting personnel, and effective use of basic and advanced psychological skills. Practical implications and future avenues of research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - Comment on an article A life cut short: Anthony Vontoure's 22 years were filled with turmoil by T. Miller (2002, July 23). The mission of the social work profession is to enhance human well-being and to help meet the basic human needs of all people, with particular attention to empowering people who are vulnerable, oppressed, and living in poverty. When thinking of vulnerable populations, social work theorists, researchers, and practitioners are not likely to think about college athletics. College sports is one avenue used by adolescents who come from hazardous environments where crime, gang involvement, and poor secondary educational conditions have left them vulnerable. Student-athletes, earning an academic degree entails more than coursework as evidenced over the past several years by the increase in mental health issues on college campuses. The treatment of mental health disorders is not the only service social workers can provide to student-athletes, they are also qualified to provide and coordinate student-athlete services for athletic departments and individual teams. Social workers in athletic departments can provide guidance about academic support services, career development internships, financial aid, mental health, athletic performance enhancement, injury, community service, and other issues.

AB - We marvel at the steely nerves, acute concentration, and flawless execution exhibited on the 18th green, at the free throw line, in the starting blocks, and on the balance beam. While state-of-the-art training regimens have extended athletes' physical boundaries, more and more coaches are realizing the importance of sport psychology in taking athletic performance to new levels. Tomorrow's record-breaking accomplishments will not be the result of athletes' training harder physically, but of athletes' training smarter mentally. This book provides information that coaches need to help athletes build mental toughness and achieve excellence--in sport and in life. As a coach, you'll gain a big-picture perspective on the mental side of sport by examining how athletes act, think, and feel when they practice and compete. You'll learn to use such mental tools as goal setting, imagery, relaxation, energization, and self-talk to help your athletes build mental training programs. You'll also see how assisting your athletes in developing mental skills such as motivation, energy management, focus, stress management, and self-confidence leads to increased enjoyment, improved life skills, and enhanced performance. And you'll discover how to put it all together into mental plans and mental skills training programs that allow your athletes to attain and maintain a mind-set that fosters peak performance. Written primarily for high school coaches, this book is a practical, easy-to-use resource reflecting the two authors' combined 45 years of teaching, coaching, researching, and consulting experience. It reflects principles that are not only consistent with the latest theory and research, but have also stood the test of time and worked for coaches and athletes in all sports at all levels. You'll come away from this book with a greater understanding and appreciation for sport psychology and the practical knowledge you need to put it to work for you and your athletes.

AB - In the United States, parents frequently encourage their children to participate in sports. Research studies indicate that participation in athletics results in reduced delinquent behavior, improved academic performance, and better social adjustment (Kremer-Sadlik &c Kim, 2007). Parents often view extracurricular sports as ways to teach social skills and to impart a sense of community to their children. By involving children in athletic activities, whether by playing in Little League baseball, joining in neighborhood pick-up games, or just by watching televised sports together, parents can promote important values. Because athletics are central to the families of many children, stories and metaphors drawn from popular sports have potential therapeutic value. This chapter does not focus on enhancing athletic performance. Instead, we hope to elucidate how the use of sports stories and metaphors in counseling promotes engagement, builds therapeutic alliances, overcomes resistance, highlights strengths, clarifies conflict and struggles, facilitates hope, and assists in the termination process.

AB - The Olympic Games are an unusual sporting experience for most athletes and an alien competition context for some. The four-year cycle offers few opportunities for most athletes to gain experience and ‘acclimatize’ to the unique mental challenges of the Olympic environment. We do not propose to detail the specific mental skills training we provide for Olympic athletes in New Zealand (NZ); as we know from discussions with colleagues from other nations that there is little real variation in the ‘basic’ mental skills training offered around the world for Olympic athletes. In our experience, beyond the mental skills needs that most elite athlete typically work on, there are a number of mental challenges more common (or even unique) in the Olympic environment. The main obvious effect for NZ Olympic teams from the focus outlined has been in terms of a clear and solid sense of team unity and togetherness.

AB - Eating disorders are serious clinical issues that can have severe physical and psychological ramifications. Although prevalence rates of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are low in the general population, it has been reported that prevalence rates are higher among individuals involved in the athletic milieu. Unfortunately, based on the demands of the sport environment, these individuals may be significantly less likely to seek treatment for these disorders, thus may experience dangerous short- and long-term consequences. Yet, even when such athletes do seek help, they often receive psychological treatments that have not been demonstrated to be efficacious among methodologically sound research studies. This article clarifies the current state of eating disorder treatment efficacy so that practitioners working with eating disordered athletic clientele can adopt more ethical and effective treatment practices.

This review considers some of the emerging definitions and conceptualizations, and examines how mental toughness might be developed in performers. Qualitative and quantitative approaches to the study of mental toughness are evaluated, and developments in measuring this important concept are discussed. Research that has examined the relationship between mental toughness, performance, and perception are also reviewed. Future directions for research are offered.

AB - The primary intent of this special issue, which is the first special issue for JCSP (Journal of Clinical Sport Psychology), is to provide the reader with a clear sense of the way that psychologists from different universities, with different types of university affiliations, and working within the contexts of different institutional needs, have developed clinical sport psychology programs at their respective institutions. Our intent in putting together this special issue is in no way intended to suggest that professionals providing performance enhancement services exclusively, or those institutions providing those services exclusively, are in any way flawed. Nor are we suggesting that one service delivery model is necessarily better or worse than any other. Rather, consistent with the mission of JCSP , our intent is to provide a forum for a discussion of the comprehensive psychological care model offered by many sport psychology professionals and academic institutions. It is our hope that the eight papers in this special issue provide useful information to those currently involved and those interested in becoming involved in providing clinical sport psychology services in the intercollegiate athletics domain. It is our hope that this issue sparks further discussion and research into the integration of mental health services and collegiate athletics.

AB - Sport psychologists work in a variety of settings, often with athletes who have qualities that most people find attractive. For athletes, their worlds are usually filled with people who have agendas other than their happiness (e.g., medals, fame, future financial gains). The sport psychologist may be the only person with whom the athlete can talk about deeper issues than training and performance. Romantic or erotic attraction between sport psychologists and those in their care probably occurs more often than many would believe, or want to believe. The topic is so taboo that it is often kept in the closet in the training and education of sport psychologists. Erotic feelings in service are often disturbing, shocking, and sources of professional and personal shame. Helping students and practitioners of sport psychology understand the roots of these phenomena may go a long way towards a better understanding of our all-too-human responses to those we serve. In Part I we review the literature on erotic transference and countertransference in psychotherapy and sport psychology service delivery and make suggestions for opening the closet doors on these phenomena for educators, students, supervisees, and supervisors.

AB - This study examined the effects of attentional intervention strategies upon perceived exertion in female exercisers (N = 13). Interventions were based upon Stevinson and Biddle's (1999) coping strategy model, from which 4 variations of attentional style are derived: internal and external association, and internal and external dissociation. The first of 5 sessions consisted of a sub-maximal VO2 test aimed at assessing aerobic capacity of the participants. In the following 4 sessions, participants pedaled on stationary cycling ergometer at 75% VO2 max for 10 minutes, and rated their perceived exertion (RPE) in 1-minute intervals. Significant (p < .01) differences in RPE between the associative and dissociative treatments emerged. The 2 associative treatments resulted in higher RPE levels than the 2 dissociative treatments for the same physical load. However, non-significant differences in RPE emerged between the internal and external dimensions, suggesting that the associative-dissociative dimension is the main determinant of RPE. Pragmatic applications of these findings and future research directions are offered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - Research has demonstrated the anxiolytic and affective changes following resistance exercise. However, several studies have allowed the participants to leave the testing facility and return at a later time to complete psychological assessments. This weakens internal validity, making it impossible to interpret findings as due to exercise per se. To address this issue, 23 male participants were randomly assigned to either a "stay" or "go" group. Within each group, all participants completed a non-exercise control session and a weight-training session based on 50% of their one repetition maximum for each of five exercises. All participants remained in the laboratory for 60 minutes following each session, at which time only those in the "go" group left the laboratory and returned at 90 and 120 minutes for their remaining affective assessments. The results indicate that despite transient disruptions in mood, an acute bout of resistance exercise results in positive psychological changes that occur within 60 minutes after completion of the exercise session and which persist up to 120 minutes post-exercise. Allowing participants to leave the laboratory or requiring them to remain in the testing environment was found to lead to different patterns of affective responses during the post-exercise assessment period. Future researchers must take into account such methodological issues when designing acute exercise studies requiring extended periods of post-exercise assessment.

AB - The present case study illustrates the treatment of a 19-year-old female lacrosse player, classified as experiencing Performance Dysfunction (Pdy) by the Multilevel Classification System for Sport Psychology (MCS-SP). The self-referred collegiate athlete was treated using the manualized Mindfulness-Acceptance-Commitment (MAC) protocol (Gardner & Moore, 2004a, 2007). The intervention consisted of eight individual sessions and several follow-up contacts via e-mail. The majority of the sessions addressed clinically related and sport-related concerns, including difficulties in emotion regulation and problematic interpersonal relationships. Based on self-report, coach report, and one outcome assessment measure, the psychological intervention resulted in enhanced overall behavioral functioning and enhanced athletic performance. This case study suggests that following careful case formulation based on appropriate assessment and interview data, the MAC intervention successfully targeted the clearly defined psychological processes underlying the athlete's performance concerns and personal obstacles, thus resulting in enhanced well-being and athletic performance improvements.

AB - Comments on an article by Jessica M. Lutkenhouse (see record 2008-18365-005). This response to a case study focuses on how I would approach the development of an intervention program for Jenny. Such a program begins with extensive psychological and physical assessments. The psychological assessment would be garnered primarily through observation of Jenny at practice and in games, extensive interviewing of the athlete, and, with her permission, interviewing her coaches and parents. The physical assessment would involve testing of Jenny's injured knee as well as a complete conditioning evaluation. The key issues that emerged as part of the conceptualization of Jenny's Performance Dysfunction include: (a) family issues, including the internalizations of a perfectionistic father and a needy mother; (b) unresolved feelings related to her parents' divorce; and (c) emotional immaturity that expresses itself in fear of failure, inappropriate emotions, and avoidance from conflict. The intervention would take a multimodal approach that involves: (a) insight; (b) emotional exploration; (c) behavioral change; and (d) mental skills. The program would conclude with a post-intervention assessment that would be comprised of objective evaluation of Jenny's physical condition, coach feedback about Jenny's behavior, and, finally, Jenny's own assessment of changes that have occurred due to the intervention.

AB - Comments on an article by Jessica M. Lutkenhouse (see record 2008-18365-005). This article reflects a response to the case of a freshman student-athlete lacrosse player who was in the process of transitioning into a Division I environment. Within the context of the case response, guidelines were provided for assessment of the student-athlete at four separate, yet interrelated levels of psychological development. These levels were: as a person; as a student-athlete who exists in a high-risk environment; as a teammate; and as a performer in the sport of lacrosse. Relatedly, it was suggested how the strengths and needs of this individual could be assessed and how resulting needs assessment information could be used in the design of an individual plan for the student-athlete. As such, it was suggested that the individual plan would most likely center on helping the individual to become increasingly aware of herself as a person and performer, to offer guidance in adhering to her physical rehabilitation, and to develop a routine for her daily preparation and for monitoring her practice and game performances. The case response concludes with a description of a framework for determining the student-athlete's readiness for engaging in the plan and its activities.

AB - The authors conducted an investigation of mental toughness in a sample population of athletes who have achieved ultimate sporting success. Eight Olympic or world champions, 3 coaches, and 4 sport psychologists agreed to participate. Qualitative methods addressed 3 fundamental issues: the definition of mental toughness, the identification of its essential attributes, and the development of a framework of mental toughness. Results verified the authors' earlier definition of mental toughness and identified 30 attributes that were essential to being mentally tough. These attributes clustered under 4 separate dimensions (attitude/mindset, training, competition, postcompetition) within an overall framework of mental toughness. Practical implications and future avenues of research involving the development of mental toughness and measurement issues are discussed.

AB - Reviews the book, Sports neuropsychology: A new frontier after all these years by Ruben J. Echemendía (Ed.) (see record 2006-04112-000). This book provides clinical neuropsychologists and psychologists with an introduction to the rapidly emerging area of sports neuropsychology. The book serves as a resource on the diagnosis and management of concussion, the development of concussion management programmes, consultation with sports teams and interpretation of clinical data. The book's 17 chapters are grouped into five sections. Part I places sports neuropsychology into both historical and contemporary contexts. Part II provides an overview of concussion assessment and management. In Part III, concussion assessment and management programmes are described, including potential pitfalls in the establishment and maintenance of such programmes. Part IV is devoted to computerized neuropsychological test batteries, with chapters written by the developers of the batteries. Part V provides particularly informative insights into the thoughts and experiences of other members of the sports medicine team. The book will likely be of interest not only to psychologists and neuropsychologists but also to students and professionals from other sports medicine disciplines.

AB - Welcome to the inaugural issue of the Journal of Clinical Sport Psychology (JCSP)! This is an exciting time for both Human Kinetics and myself, as we embark on this wonderful yet challenging new mission. So what is this mission? Well, that's a topic worthy of much elaboration. The goal of JCSP is to publish research and practice articles that make a strong effort to integrate these various domains so that readers not only learn about specific aspects of sport participation, but also learn how these distinct components come together to advance their understanding of the whole athlete. JCSP welcomes theoretical, empirical, and review papers that address topics relating to psychological health and well-being of athletes and coaches, psychological aspects of athletic performance, and issues and concerns that connect physical and psychological processes. Putting together this editorial board was a remarkable achievement, and I have full confidence that this special group of people will be influential in shaping JCSP for many years to come.

AB - I have, over the years, written many forewords, prefaces, reviews, and dedications. None has ever been as challenging as this one. This piece is written to help launch a new and exciting journal, The Journal of Clinical Sport Psychology . As a member of the editorial board, Frank Gardner asked that I write a dedication in memoriam to Michael J. Mahoney. This is a journal that Michael would have loved. It combined two of his great interests, the interaction between clinical phenomena and sports. Michael died last May. I learned of his passing through an e-mail and have been trying to piece together various sources of information. Michael studied and collaborated with the foremost figures of our time, both in the U.S. and throughout the world. I met Michael many times over the years, in social situations, listening to him present a workshop or deliver a keynote address, or on more informal occasions. As an athlete, Michael was active and competitive. He won many weightlifting medals and the picture on the previous page speaks volumes. Our hope is that the inception of this journal can serve as a tiny light to celebrate Michael's life and work. Michael's will requested that his ashes be taken and scattered in County Cork. He will have finally come home and be at rest. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - The primary purpose of this article is to expand the discussion about the role of science, clinical thinking, the state of the discipline, and the manner in which evidence-based practice may aid in the development of the field of sport psychology. Rejecting pseudoscientific principles and embracing sound scientific standards of research and practice will result in an increasingly fresh and vibrant field from which greater innovation and evolution can occur. This innovation will inevitably lead to a renewed commitment to theory building, as the evolving scientific database will drive new ways of thinking about the myriad of issues presented by athletic clientele. By embracing the evidence-based practice philosophy, not only will sound scientific advancements emerge, but most importantly, the overall well-being of our athletic clientele will be enhanced.

AB - Reviews the book Sports neuropsychology: Assessment and management of traumatic brain injury by R. J. Echemendia (Ed.) (see record 2006-04112-000). The book focuses on the assessment and subsequent management of sports-related concussive injuries, the most common form of traumatic brain injury in athletes. Seventeen chapters are divided into five sections: Sports Neuropsychology in Context; Concussion Assessment and Management; Testing Programs; Computerized Neuropsychological Test Batteries; and Views from within the Sports Medicine Team. The book begins by considering contextual factors contributing to the evolution of sports neuropsychology, including a compelling historical account of the often violent heritage of sports and athletics. Aspects of management receiving coverage include useful background chapters on the neurophysiology and epidemiology of concussion, as well as consideration of "real time" (i.e., sideline) assessment of athletes, which takes the clinician out of the consulting room and onto the playing field, along with coaches, trainers, and medical staff.

AB - A review of the sport psychology literature demonstrated that a multitude of factors are involved in elite athletic performance. However, the literature appeared to lack an organizing lens. This study set out to provide this lens through the creation of a new athletic hierarchy based on the work of Abraham Maslow, but that is specific to athletes. In order to test this athletic hierarchy, a new assessment tool, the Hierarchy of Athletic Need Development Survey (HANDS) was constructed. The HANDS is an 80-item self-report assessment tool. Subjects respond to the items using a seven point Likert scale (i.e. 1 = completely disagree to 7 = completely agree). Scores are totaled providing four subscale scores (20 items per subscale) and an overall score. These four subscales are based on Maslow's theory of "Hierarchy of Needs". Ten male Division I intercollegiate varsity basketball players and their head coach participated in the study. Subjects completed the HANDS on two separate occasions and their scores were analyzed to investigate the applicability of Maslow's theory and utility of the HANDS. Five independent hypotheses were proposed and results of statistical analyses to support these hypotheses were mixed. Despite this fact, results appeared to be promising that Maslow's theory is applicable and that the HANDS can be used as an effective screening tool for elite athletes. More research is needed to confirm these results and aid in future development of the HANDS. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - A mixed methods design (concurrent triangulation strategy) was used to investigate the impact of the high-level athlete on the sibling relationship as measured by the Adult Sibling Relationship Questionnaire (ASRQ) constructs (warmth, conflict, and rivalry). A sample of 94 (mostly Caucasian) sibling dyads (n = 188) consisting of highlevel athletes and their non-high-level athlete siblings (ages 18-25, males and females, same gender, first and second borns, biological siblings, from two parent families, 0-4 years in age disparity, and from a family size of two to four children) participated in this study. Participants completed the ASRQ and qualitative, open-ended questions at the end of this measure via a secure web-page link. Twenty-two sports across 75 colleges (NCAA Division I-III) participated in this study. Quantitative correlation analysis was conducted through confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses and a series of paired samples and independent sample t-tests. A qualitative, confirmatory, content top down analysis was implemented to identify units, themes, and categories. Qualitative data was transformed or quantitized via binarizing themes, producing inter and intea-respondent matrices. Factor loadings for the Intra-Respondent Matrix, ASRQ data sets from this study, and ASRQ normative data demonstrated similarities. Findings indicated the presence of a high-level athlete has an impact on the sibling relationship. Quantitative results suggested differences in high-level athletes and their sibling's perceptions of conflict. Qualitative findings indicated that these sibling dyads experienced a decrease in conflict and an increase in warmth upon entering young adulthood. However, qualitative results illustrated a significant amount of rivalry suggesting that high-level athletes were perceived to experience more paternal favoritism. Interestingly, most qualitative endorsements of parental favoritism/rivalry included a neutralizing/equalizing statement. Notwithstanding, most participants experienced an abundance of warmth regardless of current or past conflict and/or rivalry. Statistical comparisons between this study's sample and the ASRQ normative sample yielded differences in conflict and rivalry. This study's findings add to the understanding of family dynamics, family systems theory, and considerations for family therapy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - A societal bifurcation of the sexes has created two different experiences of sport in the Western world. Societal ascriptions of instrumental/agentic traits predominately to males, and expressive/communal traits to females, have been challenged. Researchers have theorized that sport has facilitated androgyny, a psychological bisociation of masculine and feminine energy, in women. Androgyny has been primary in Jungian concept; however, analytical principles have rarely been utilized in sport. This study explored three areas of Jungian theory to augment this limited utilization: (1) archetypology, (2) typology, and (3) androgyny. Phase I involved a quantitative study of 50 female athlete members of collegiate teams, sport clubs, or who self-identified as an athlete. This sample completed the Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), the Rank Order of Archetypes (ROA), and the Goddess Within Questionnaire (GWQ). From this pool, eight athletes were selected for Phase II, a retest of the ROA and GWQ, and two one-hour qualitative interviews that probed: (1) feminine archetypology as a lived experience, (2) typology as a phenomenological experience, (3) gender beliefs and personality, and (4) gender beliefs and archetypology. Consistent with previous research, findings revealed: (1) archetypologically, selected female athletes identified with Artemis, distinct from other archetypes of the feminine, to a statistically significant degree, (2) typologically, female athletes reported a statistically significantly higher score in intuition as a perceiving function in the MBTI as compared with the general population of females, and (3) a strong reported identification with Artemis was congruent with a reported affirmation of the construct of androgyny. The qualitative interview yielded rich, psychologically in-depth narratives of selected female athletes' inner constructions of self relating to archetypology, typology, and gender. Implications for sport practitioners included: (1) female athletes were still in search of aspects of their essential gendered self, (2) female athletes evidenced emotional wounding that varied in intensity, and (3) sport was efficacious in their healing and inner growth. Analytical psychology provided a multidimensional and heuristic view of gender superimposed on Jung's individuation theory. Such constructs as personality, self theory, sport-self confidence, and sport motivation as each relates to constructs of gender emerged from the interviews.

AB - Sport is very significant in the physical, psychological, and social development of children. For various reasons, including role schemas, society has considered sport to be a male dominated domain. This has resulted in the presence of inequities for female athletes at various levels, especially for young girls. Many young female athletes develop gender role conflicts, between their feminine and athletic roles. They also have much lower perceived sport competence than male athletes. These two issues have caused young female athletes to quit sport, rather than cope with societal difficulties they face in their attempts to participate in sport. The presence of role models can cause significant positive influences on young athletes who look up to them for guidance. Athletes learn to model the characteristics and behaviors of their role model, learning to work through any difficulties that they may face in hopes of becoming successful and similar to their role model. This study investigated the presence of a significant, older female athlete for young female softball players which resulted in lower prevalence of gender role conflict and higher perceived sport competence, which inevitably both lead to higher motivation to continue in sport in the future.

AB - Health psychologists, in addition to preventing people from developing health problems, are expected to play a role in helping ill people and those with physical disorders maintain their mental health. This study investigated the mental health of physically challenged people to clarify the relationship between psychological wellbeing (Ryff, DATE) and the sense of coherence (SOC: Antonovsky, DATE). Participants were physically challenged female athletes in the Japan Wheelchair Basketball Federation and a comparison group of non-challenged female members of a sports gym in Tokyo. The results showed that physically challenged female athletes had an equivalent level of mental health to that of female athletes who were not physically challenged, suggestive of a strong relationship between playing wheelchair basketball and SOC. The strongest link was observed between the self-acceptance aspect of psychological wellbeing scale and SOC. These results indicate that continuous commitment to sports leads to improvements in SOC. It is concluded that improving psychological wellbeing and SOC can support physically challenged people to maintain their mental health.

AB - This chapter is reprinted from Journal of Sports Psychology , 1995. Understanding factors which may influence the occurrence of flow in elite athletes was the goal of the present investigation. 28 elite athletes from 7 sports were interviewed about the factors they perceived influenced their experience of flow state. Inductive content analyses of athletes' responses to questions about what facilitates, prevents, and disrupts flow, resulted in 10 dimensions that synthesized 361 themes suggested by the athletes. These themes and dimensions provided insight into factors that may influence whether or not flow occurs in elite athletes. For example, some of the more salient factors influencing whether or not flow occurred included preparation, both physical and mental; confidence; focus; how the performance felt and progressed; and optimal motivation and arousal level. This study also involved asking elite athletes about the perceived controllability of these factors, and of the state of flow itself. The majority of the athletes interviewed perceived the flow state to be controllable, or potentially within their control. A large percentage of the factors seen to facilitate or prevent flow were perceived as controllable; however, factors seen as disrupting flow were largely seen as uncontrollable.

Key elements that have been associated with the authors' most successful interventions include the use of simple, concrete strategies, an element of fun, positive individualized approaches, the use of role models, and involving parents. It is the authors' belief that every child will experience growth, and some degree of success, if someone who cares devotes time to nurturing important mental skills related to personal development.

Fourth, the uses and effectiveness of mental skills training in sport are reviewed, and finally, suggestions for the future of mental training in sport are provided. The theme of the chapter is that mental skills training has evolved from the decontextualized application of specific techniques to enhance performance (e.g., imagery, self-talk) into a comprehensive intervention process whereby various philosophies, models, strategies, techniques, and consultant styles are utilized in specific social-cultural contexts to help athletes and coaches achieve significant personal development as well as performance success.

AB - This chapter describes three published studies that studied mood in the sport of wakeboarding. The first study (see Fazackerley, Lane, and Mahoney, 2003) focused on the factorial validity of the Brunel Mood Scale (Terry, Lane, Lane, and Keohane, 1999; Terry, Lane, and Fogarty, 2003). The second study focused on mood-performance relationships (Fazackerley, Lane, and Mahoney, 2004). The third paper focused on the effectiveness of intervention strategies designed to improve mood states and subsequently improve performance (Fazackerley, Lane, and Mahoney, 2002). The present chapter represents an attempt to integrate these studies. Data from the validity study is re-analysed to produce a 15-item six factor version of the BRUMS. Data from the third study are re-analyzed by investigating ideographic mood-performance relationships. By integrating these three studies, it is hoped that the relationship between construct measurement and using theory to interpret applied interventions will be highlighted.

The book is a guide to understanding the mental demands of the sport of bowling. The book contains extensive dialogue about the psychological skills necessary to compete at an elite level and is divided into five sections. Part I is dedicated to mental preparation for competition and includes deliberate practice suggestions to accelerate skill development. Part II focuses on the significance of pre-competition routines for game day preparation and suggestions for pre-performance routines throughout competition. Part III examines key peak performance issues in bowling, including critical sport psychology areas such as confidence, positive thinking, coping with distractions, and performing underpressure. Part IV is an engaging section because it provides a number of frequently asked questions by bowlers of all skill levels. Finally, Part V assesses other aspects of the sport including team bowling and bowling as a family sport. Throughout this book, research and theory are translated into easy-to-understand information and written mainly for bowlers with minimal sport psychology knowledge. Overall, this is a very useful book for athletes, coaches, and sport psychology professional who intend to compete or work with competitive bowlers.

AB - Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate depression, anxiety and self-esteem levels of swimmer children and to compare the results with the non-athlete children. Methods: As swimmers, 31 children who regularly go to a swimming club at ages 9-13 were enrolled. And as the control group, 30 children at ages 9-13 chosen from an elementary school have been randomly selected and evaluated. Both groups have been assessed with childhood depression inventory, state-trait anxiety inventory for children and child form of Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory. Results: Average scores of the self-esteem of the swimmers were statistically higher (p<0.01) and depression scores were lower compared to those of the control group (p<0.01). The state anxiety inventory levels were found to be higher in the swimmers. The difference between groups was found to be statistically significant (p<0.01). Discussion: In opposition to the positive effects of sports on self-esteem and depressive symptoms, the high level of anxiety determined in the swimmers may be related with their performance. Also on the area of child psychiatry, extensive studies should be carried out on physical activity and sports and, how the sports affect mental health.

AB - Participation in sporting events is related to bodily balance and psychological stability. Although it is widely appreciated that mental states can make the difference between winning and losing, the role of psychology in sport has largely been restricted to pre-match advice and instruction. Most studies in sport psychology are focused on the primary goal of the discipline - performance enhancement. Very few studies are concerned with another major aspect- the mental health of the athletes. As it is widely believed that sport is a masculine affair, it is interesting and important to make a note on mental health of female sport persons. The present study is an attempt to append impetus in that direction. The sample consisted of 304 sport persons (161 male and 143 Female) from South India. The tool employed was Mental Health Status Scale (Gireesan and Samsanandaraj, 1988). The results show that the male sport persons scored significantly high on overall mental health compared to that of female sport persons. Out of six components, attitude toward self and autonomy being the components of mental health do not show such difference. This paper discusses the results critically and stirs up the conventional notions of mental heath in the context of sport in general and gender in particular.

AB - Objective: To investigate the relationship between mental toughness, sport injury beliefs, pain, and adherence toward a sport injury rehabilitation program. Design: A prospective design was employed that evaluated adherence over the entire rehabilitation period. Participants: 70 patients undertaking a sport injury rehabilitation program for a tendonitis related injury. Main Outcome Measures: Adherence was measured using self report measures of clinic and home based rehabilitation alongside attendance. Results: No association was found between mental toughness and coping appraisals, although high mentally tough individuals displayed more positive threat appraisals and were better able to cope with pain than their less mentally tough counterparts. Greater attendance at rehabilitation sessions was displayed by more mentally tough individuals; however, more positive behavior during clinic rehabilitation was characterized by low mental toughness. Conclusions: Despite the benefits of being mentally tough, sports medicine providers need to be aware that a high degree of mental toughness may have negative consequences upon rehabilitation behavior and subsequently recovery outcomes.

AB - The present study presents a case of psychological intervention on an athlete with an interoceptive avoidance disorder. This disorder manifested itself through a fear response conditioned to somatic stimuli, occurring during the 1,500 metres run. Techniques of arousal control, exposure and other cognitive approach strategies such as thought adaptation and self-instructions were all used in the psychological intervention. Although in cases like this psychological intervention is necessary, little scientific literature is to be found on psychological disorders of sportspeople. As a result, the present study offers a twofold angle of approach: to describe the intervention procedure used and to consider the possibility of generalising the same to similar cases, in which the properties of the training or the competition act as triggers of the problem on account of conditioning to either external or internal stimuli.

AB - Thirty-five years after former American Psychological Association (APA) President George A. Miller (1969) exhorted psychologists to "give psychology away," then-current APA President Ronald F. Levant (2005) encouraged us to "make psychology a household word"--but how do we go about accomplishing this goal? To highlight the value, issues, and challenges of providing such services, 2 case examples of public outreach are described: The Mental Health Tune Up, a 2-day community outreach event, involves multiple mental health organizations in seminars, a resource fair, mental health self-screenings, and workshops; the Toronto Marathon Psyching Team offers mental skills, support, and mental and emotional triage to runners before, during, and after a major international marathon. Event organization, volunteer training and support, interdisciplinary collaboration, corporate community support, systems integration, publicity, and program evaluation are discussed.

AB - The purpose of the study was to examine the referral practices of sport psychology consultants in Canada. Eighteen (male = 10, female = 8) sport consultants registered with the Canadian Mental Training Registry (CMTR) returned a completed Referral Questionnaire for Sport Consultants and consent form (response rate = 51.4%). Means and standard deviations were calculated for the questions asked on a 5-point Likert scale. On the average, respondents indicated that they rarely encounter athletes with clinical problems and clients are rarely referred to them. This finding, however, was not consistent across the sport psychology consultants surveyed with some always referring and others never referring to registered psychologists or mental health professionals. When referrals are made, they are directed primarily toward specialists and those with an interest in sport. The National Sport Centre is one body that sport psychologists can tap into for referral lists. In the initial consultation, approximately half of the sport psychology consultants broach the topic of referral with their clients. The referral process is explained more thoroughly during subsequent sessions. Strategies sport psychology consultants employ to facilitate the referral process include networking, updating referral lists and maintaining contact with the client once the referral process has been initiated.

AB - The purpose of the present study was to provide a detailed description of German Olympians' experience of competing at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. In-depth, open-ended phenomenological interviews were conducted with twelve German athletes who competed in Athens. The athletes represented various sports but in order to keep their identity confidential their names were not disclosed. The interviews, originally in German, were transcribed and served as the primary source for data analysis. In a cross-cultural setting where some of the interviews were translated into English, a method informed by hermeneutic analysis was used to derive a thematic structure of the research participants' experiences. Four grounds emerged from the analysis of the athletes' experience: (1) Time, (2) The Preparation, (3) The Olympics, and (4) The Overall Result. Time provided a context for all other aspects of the athletes' experience of competing in Athens. The athletes first had to prepare for the competition (The Preparation, which included the sub themes of Training and Making the Team), and then subsequently competed in The Olympics. The ground of The Olympics reflected the athletes' experiences of dealing with Distractions, The Olympic Village, and the fact that The Whole World is Watching. Finally, the athletes obtained a certain result (The Overall Result), which in many ways influenced how they perceived their overall Olympic experience. Three figural themes stood out in the context of the four grounds: (1) The Competitor/Self, (2) Others, and (3) The Competition/Event. Athletes talked about the sub themes of Body, Emotions/Feelings, Staying Focused, and Identity/Personality when discussing the theme The Competitor/Self. Support and The Team were the two sub themes that emerged for the figural theme of Others. When discussing the theme of The Competition/Event, participants talked about The Sport, The Setting/Site, and Opponents. Overall, the findings suggested that while there were considerable individual differences in participants' experiences most of these athletes lacked systematic mental preparation for the 2004 Athens Olympics and also experienced various forms of organizational stress.

AB - The study examined the relationship between adolescent girls' body image and sport involvement. Specifically, this study explored certain aspects of the athletic environment, including family, peers, coaches, and sport context. Adolescent female participants (N = 262) from two high school in the Central Valley of California completed demographic, body image, and sociocultural influences questionnaires. Participants who reported being athletes (N = 154) also completed a sport context questionnaire. Results from this study indicated a relationship between higher body image and sport involvement. More specifically, individuals who participate in sports scored higher on feelings of physical attractiveness and investment in being physically fit or athletically competent than did individuals who do not participate in sports. In addition, among the sociocultural influences investigated in this study, mothers and best female friends had the strongest relationship to female adolescents' body image. In particular, female peers played a significant role in the body image development of adolescent female athletes. This study also found a relationship between a positive relationship with a coach and higher body image in adolescent female athletes. A relationship between adolescent female athletes' body image and pressure to perform was significant in this study as well. Body image concerns and eating disorders are rampant in the adolescent female population in the United States. This study found sport participation to be a positive, protective factor in the development of adolescent girls' body image. Implications for future research and clinical applications with adolescent females are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Sport psychology is a booming field. Specialists in all areas of sports are now aware that mental preparation of athletes is as important as physical preparation because what makes the difference between two equally skilled athletes in a competition is his or her mental readiness to perform. The principles of sport psychology translate very well to the field of music performance because the highly competitive field of music performance involves a similar pressure to perform well at a given time when the pressure is on. Playing a musical instrument or singing also demands a high degree of muscular control and coordination that can either be facilitated or inhibited by the musician's mental disposition. This study takes advantage of the extensive research and rapid advancement of sport psychology by applying its concepts to music performance. After surveying the major sport psychology literature, the author formulated a set of interview questions. Six performing musicians from different areas of music performance, different cultural backgrounds, and different career stages were interviewed. The sample of musicians included an orchestra musician, a singer, a collaborative pianist and a conductor. They also represented the United States, France, Puerto Rico and Quebec. In this paper the author describes the main principles of sport psychology: goal setting, pre-event routines, visualization, focus, arousal regulation (energy levels), and optimal performance. Then, based on the interviews, the author applies these principles to music performance. The interviews allow the author to explore the extent to which selected professional musicians apply sport psychology principles. It also helps to determine how the concepts can be adapted to best serve musicians and can be use as a basis for further studies. The document is organized into seven chapters: (I) Introduction; (II) Structure of the Preparation---for a competition or a performance---(topics covered: Goal Setting, Organization of the Practice Sessions and Pre-Event Routine); (III) Tools for Enhancement (this includes all the different types of imagery or visualization); (IV) Interference; (V) Psychological Skills leading to Optimal Performance (topics covered: Energy Level Regulation and Focus); (VI) Optimal Performance (includes the concept: "being in the zone"); and (VII) Conclusion.

AB - Exercise psychology encompasses the disciplines of psychiatry, clinical and counseling psychology, health promotion, and the movement sciences. This emerging field involves diverse mental health issues, theories, and general information related to physical activity and exercise. Numerous research investigations across the past 20 years have shown both physical and psychological benefits from physical activity and exercise. Exercise psychology offers many opportunities for growth while positively influencing the mental and physical health of individuals, communities, and society. However, the exercise psychology literature has not addressed ethical issues or dilemmas faced by mental health professionals providing exercise psychology services. This initial discussion of ethical issues in exercise psychology is an important step in continuing to move the field forward. Specifically, this article will address the emergence of exercise psychology and current health behaviors and offer an overview of ethics and ethical issues, education/training and professional competency, cultural and ethnic diversity, multiple-role relationships and conflicts of interest, dependency issues, confidentiality and recording keeping, and advertisement and self-promotion.

AB - Objectives: Although 'injury-related information processing' has been identified as an important element of athletes' psychological reactions to injury, knowledge of the mental representation of athletic injuries and their fluctuations over time is still rather limited. The purpose of this study was to enhance this knowledge by exploring an athlete's injury-related thoughts, sensations and images throughout the recovery process. Design: A prospective, longitudinal case-study design was used. Method: The participant was a 28-year old male rugby player who had sustained a severely dislocated shoulder. Eight unstructured interviews were conducted over a period of 20 weeks, while a follow-up interview took place 3 years post-injury. The interviews were audio-taped, transcribed, and analysed using qualitative analyses procedures. Results: Four interdependent themes emerged from the interviews: (a) awareness, (b) mental imagery, (c) mental model of the injury, and (d) mental 'itinerary' of the recovery process. The temporal dynamics of the recovery process were evident in the flux of attention-demanding properties of the injury; (dis)appearance of images over time; increasing complexity of the mental model; and construction and 'concretisation' of the mental itinerary. Furthermore, the role of the athlete's desired self-concept in shaping his inferences, actions and emotions, emerged as a fifth theme. Conclusions: The findings were synthesised into a 'multi-track' conceptualisation of the athlete's covert and overt injury-related activities over time.

The programme consisted of 8 group sessions, complemented by other individual initiatives, where the following skills were developed: motivation, emotional control, self-confidence, concentration, and communication. The aims were as follows: to familiarize the referees with basic psychological skills, to help them learn how to use them, apply them in their work, and improve on them. In their evaluation of the programme, the referees that took part showed a high degree of overall satisfaction, perceiving the course content to be useful in the long run and acknowledging the need to continue with this type of training in the future. In the paper, a discussion is made of the most relevant contributions and the difficulties that were encountered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - This is the first applied handbook for practitioners who want to help patients begin and maintain an exercise program as a lifestyle change. Mental health practitioners (MHPs) often earn a trust that not many other professionals do with their patients. It is with this trust that MHPs are able to encourage and help their clients begin a healthy and active lifestyle through exercise programs. This book, with easy to understand language, provides a simple introduction for mental health practitioners and clinicians to help their clients achieve better mental and physical health through exercise and learn how effective the psychological aspects of exercise can be. The book helps MHPs obtain the background of ways to achieve proper fitness, and to go through the process of obtaining information about the client's individual needs, and finally to prescribe an exercise program that is compatible with those needs. A fundamental knowledge of applied principles of exercise physiology provides additional credibility to the prescribed exercise regimen. Coverage includes: applied exercise psychology, motivation technique, theories and models in health psychology, fundamental applied exercise physiology, specific cognitive and behavioral strategies, and program interventions. Recommended books and journals, list of exercise and health organizations, and exercise checklist are included. This book will be of use to all mental health providers, including psychiatrists, psychologists, therapists, counselors, and consultants, whose relationship with clients provides a particularly unique opportunity to gain entry for proposing lifestyle changes.

AB - Scientific knowledge about sports-related concussion has grown significantly over the past two decades, with a corresponding upsurge of awareness among coaches, team physicians, and the general public. Yet until now, no single resource existed for neuropsychologists involved in assessment, intervention, and prevention in this area. Bringing together leading experts, this volume delineates practical guidelines for evaluating mild head injury and making crucial return-to-play decisions for athletes at all levels, from schoolchildren to high school, college, and professional players. Initial chapters provide a context for understanding the role of the sports neuropsychologist, examining how this challenging yet rewarding field continues to evolve. Essential information is then presented on the nature and prevalence of mild traumatic brain injury; pre- and postconcussion assessment; the impact of age and gender variables and the type of athletic activity; and the complex process of return-to-play decision making. With special attention to ethical and professional issues, the volume reviews exemplary concussion management programs for individuals and teams in a range of settings. Coverage encompasses the most sophisticated, evidence-based neurocognitive techniques, including computerized test batteries. Also considered are ways that neuropsychologists can deliver counseling and support to those struggling with psychological aspects of injury. Two special chapters elucidate the roles of other members of the sports medicine team--the athletic trainer and the team physician--and describe keys to successful interdisciplinary collaboration. Grounded in research, yet highly accessible, this book is filled with the latest insights and tools for managing the risks involved in competitive sports and safeguarding the health of child, adolescent, and adult participants. It is an indispensable guide for neuropsychologists and rehabilitation specialists, as well as sports medicine practitioners and sports psychologists.

AB - The second edition of The Psychology of Exercise: Integrating Theory and Practice provides you with a solid foundation in exercise psychology. As in the first edition, the book is divided into two primary sections. Part I is composed of six chapters that will help students to understand and modify exercise behavior (either their own or the behavior of others). Thus, the book opens with a general introduction designed to acquaint readers with the field of exercise psychology, followed by a chapter that addresses patterns of physical activity participation. The next two chapters discuss the most popular theories of exercise behavior currently accepted and used by exercise psychology scholars and practitioners. Chapter 5 introduces the more compelling social influences (e.g., leadership, social support) that have been documented to impact psychological responses and exercise behavior. The section concludes with an extensively revised chapter that addresses intervention approaches aimed at modifying exercise behavior. Part II is devoted to the more commonly promoted and investigated psychosocial influences and consequences of exercise, including the bi-directional relationship between exercise and concepts such as personality and body image. Additionally, this section highlights the impact of exercise on various mental health states such as depression, anxiety, stress, emotional well-being, self-concept/self-esteem, and health-related quality of life.

AB - The management of sports-related mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI), or concussion, has received recognition as a major public health issue (Kelly, 1999). Some sources indicate there are at least 300,000 sports-related MTBIs per year. Although concussion without loss of consciousness is the most common type of sports-related head injury, it is more difficult to detect and may often be misdiagnosed by sports medicine practitioners (Collins et al., 1999). Great concern and appreciation for the importance of accurate diagnosis, management, and return-to-play decisions extend from the elite ranks of professional athletes (Lovell & Collins, 2001) to the fledgling child or adolescent athlete. Although professional and collegiate athletes have been the focus of much empirically based research and clinical services, there is growing interest in the younger athlete as a unique subpopulation of concussed athletes. Empirical evidence (Field et al., 2003; Lang, Teasdale, Macpherson, & Lawrence, 1994; Levin et al., 1992) and physiological theory suggest potential differential recovery patterns for high school athletes as compared to older athletes. Therefore, the creation and implementation of a successful concussion management program requires an understanding of current research and theory regarding the injury, as well as an appreciation for the unique factors that are introduced when providing concussion management services to the high school or adolescent athlete.

AB - It is the hope that every collegiate institution will establish a program for assessment and management of sports-related concussions in order to ensure consistency of care when returning an athlete to participate in athletic competition (Aubry et al., 2002; McKeever & Schatz, 2003). This chapter will provide some guidelines that may be helpful for neuropsychologists who wish to establish a college-based concussion management program or provide consultative services to such programs. We will focus on the requirements, key personnel, and factors to consider when establishing a concussion assessment and management program, as well as identify some potential obstacles and solutions.

AB - The evaluation of concussion in professional athletes has become an area of intense interest over the past decade. The most recent outgrowth of this interest has been motivated by a desire to protect the health of hockey athletes, which has resulted in the development of comprehensive concussion evaluation programs within the National Football League (NFL) (Lovell, 1999; Lovell & Barr, 2003) and the National Hockey League (NHL) (Anderson & Lovell, 1999; Lovell, Echemendía, & Burke, 2004). More recently, comprehensive assessment programs have been implemented throughout motor sports and in professional rugby. These programs have been structured to identify concussed athletes immediately after injury, to monitor the recovery process, and ultimately to avoid exposure to further injury by premature return to the field, rink, or track. This chapter will provide an overview of the concussion programs that have been developed for professional sports, and these programs will be reviewed with regard to return-to-play issues.

AB - The first section of the study sought to define mental toughness within a soccer population, and identify what the essential attributes required for the mentally tough soccer player are. A total of six male professional soccer players agreed to participate in the study. Semi-structured interview was conducted by the lead researcher. Having analyzed and interpreted the interview transcripts, and confirmed the findings with the participants, the following definition was generated: Mental toughness is having the natural or developed psychological edge that enables you to always cope better than your opponents with the many demands (competition, training,lifestyle) that soccer places on the performer. The purpose of the second phase of the investigation was to confirm further the definition of mental toughness and identify the importance of the attributes developed in Study 1 but to a wider soccer population. A total of 43 male professional soccer players who had all played for their club first team agreed to participate in the study. The definition of mental toughness as reported in Phase One received strong support from the wider soccer population. While the present study has attempted to study the concept of mental toughness within a single-sport perspective, there remain many avenues of research that require further attention.

AB - Reviews the book Sport Psychology Library: Triathlon by Joe Baker and Whitney Sedgwick (2005). This book is a brief (less than 100 pages) how-to guide for athletes, though any sport psychology professional who works with triathletes will want to read this one. The book contains several useful psychological techniques in a reader-friendly format and is divided into three sections. Section I focuses on precompetition and training factors including motivation, goal setting, and imagery. Section II examines psychological skills for competition, including information on arousal/anxiety management and focus/concentration skills. Section III, entitled Other Issues includes chapters on dealing with pain and injuries, using reflection as a performance strategy and integrating mental skills strategies into overall triathlon training and competition. Throughout the book author clearly outline basic mental skills as applied to triathlon training and competition. The book concludes with strategies for developing pre- and post-performance plans. Overall, this is a very useful book for athletes and sport psychology professionals alike. Any triathlete can gain a mental edge from reading this book and incorporating mental skills training into their regimen. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Mental toughness is a critical element in contemporary international cricket. However, little is known beyond the obvious basics of what constitutes mental toughness in an English cricketer. This study addressed two main objectives: 1) develop a greater understanding of what mental toughness is within cricket, and 2) identify how existing mentally tough English cricketers developed their mental toughness. Twelve English cricketers identified as being among the mentally toughest during the previous 20 years were interviewed. Analysis of the focused interview transcripts identified the critical role of the player's environment in influencing 'Tough Character,' 'Tough Attitudes,' and 'Tough Thinking.' The global themes are presented in a mental toughness framework that has been used to disseminate the findings to the cricket coaching and playing population in England. The contrasting and complementary nature of the global themes are used to help provide a structural appreciation of the need for consistent interaction between environment, character, attitudes, and thinking in order that a performer can consistently be considered as mentally tough in cricket. Implications of the findings in relation to the delivery of sport psychology support within English cricket are also highlighted.

AB - Two interrelated studies examined the role psychological factors play in the prediction and prevention of sport related injury. Study 1 involved 470 rugby players who completed measures corresponding to variables in the revised Williams and Andersen (1998) stress and injury model at the beginning of the 2001 playing season. Prospective and objective data were obtained for both the number of injuries and the time missed. Results showed that social support, the type of coping, and previous injury interacted in a conjunctive fashion to maximize the relationship between life stress and injury. Study 2 examined the effectiveness of a cognitive behavioral stress management (CBSM) intervention in reducing injury among athletes from Study 1 who were identified as having an at-risk psychological profile for injury. Forty-eight players were randomly assigned to either a CBSM intervention or a no-contact control condition. Participants completed psychological measures of coping and competitive anxiety at the beginning and end of the 2002 rugby season. The assessment of injury was identical to that used in Study 1. Results showed that those in the intervention condition reported missing less time due to injury compared to their nonintervention counterparts. The intervention group also had an increase in coping resources and a decrease in worry following the program. Taken together, both studies underscore the importance of (a) psychosocial factors in identifying those athletes most vulnerable to injury and (b) cognitive behavioral stress management programs in reducing the vulnerability to injury.

Joest (2004). The reviewed title discusses the effects of anger on health and human performance in sport and at work. The book connects the personal traits disposing toward anger with the cognitive tendencies and triggering situations. Anger management programs are described that include relaxation training, social skills training, and training in cognitive reframing and problem solving. Anger disorders do not form a single diagnostic entity. Properly managed anger, according to the authors, serves both social and self-regulatory functions. Anger also has been connected with coronary disease, asthma, headache, and cancer. Anger can also stimulate or inhibit performance at work and in sport. The fairly thorough presentations are embedded in the psychology of emotions and provide the necessary background information and guidance for diagnosis and intervention to practitioners working in clinical, work, and sport psychology.

AB - Reviews the book, "The Sport Psych Handbook," edited by Shane Murphy (2005). The field of sport psychology has repeatedly produced books that drill the common mental skills of goal-setting, imagery, relaxation, and self talk into coaches' and students' heads. While these are essential interventions, coaches and athletes may wonder if these four mental skills are all that sport psychology has to offer. Editor Shane Murphy has responded to this dilemma with a coach and player guide, "The Sport Psych Handbook," which balances research and background information with hands on applied exercises on a much broader set of topics. This handbook covers the field of sport psychology like a textbook in 17 chapters and nearly 350 pages. The book is broken down into five conceptually reasonable parts. Part 1, titled "Inner Drive," contains chapters on motivation, goal setting, competitiveness, and overtraining. Part 2, "Emotional and Mental Control," has chapters devoted to typical mental skills topics of anxiety, controlling anger, concentration, and imagery. In Part 3, "Interactive Skills," the topic of team cohesion is covered in chapters regarding leadership, teamwork, and communication. Part 4 addresses "Potential Pitfalls" such as injuries, eating disorders, and substance abuse. Finally, Part 5 is dedicated to "The Educated Consumer." The three chapters on roles, qualifications, and effective sport psychologists are a resource for coaches and athletes seeking the assistance of an outside practitioner.

AB - During the past three decades, behavioral practitioners have been applying techniques to improve the performance of athletes. To what extent are interventions, designed to improve the directly and reliably measured performance of athletes in competitions, based on experimental demonstrations of efficacy? That is the question addressed by this review. All issues of three behavioral journals and seven sport psychology journals, from 1972 through 2002, were examined for articles that addressed the above question. Fifteen articles were found that met the inclusion criteria, yielding an average of only one published study every 2 years. This article reviews those articles, discusses reasons for the dearth of research in this area, and makes recommendations for much needed future research.

AB - Review of book The Sport Psych Handbook: A Complete Guide to Today's Best Mental Training Techniques edited by S. Murphy. Murphy's collection of papers in this handbook goes beyond mental training to cover much of the field of sport psychology consulting. In addressing this breadth of topics, Murphy has employed the skills of a large number of outstanding practitioner-scholars and academic-practitioners. The Sport Psych Handbook is presented in five sections. Part I is titled Inner Drive, which focuses on motivation. Part II is titled Emotional and Mental Control. In Part III, Interactive Skills is the title, and Potential Pitfalls covers the contributions in Part IV. The final section, Part V, refers to the Educated Consumer. The Sport Psych Handbook is a strong addition to the library of sport psychology texts published by Human Kinetics. It brings together the experiences of pioneers in the application of sport psychology in elite professional and Olympic sport, such as Botterill, Loehr, and May; key practitioners of sport psychology at the elite level during the past 10 to 15 years, like Perry, McCann, Balague, and Murphy; leading academics, including Hardy, Anshel, and Andersen; and an array of individuals with particular experiences of the practice of sport psychology. The handbook is a great value for it's cost and would be a valuable book for all those who practice, are studying practice, or who are learning to practice.

AB - The aim of this study was to examine female gymnasts' fear of injury, their sources of self-efficacy and the psychological strategies used to overcome their fears. The participants were 10 female gymnasts aged 12-17 years. They had all taken part in competitive gymnastics and had experienced some type of injury during their careers. Individual interviews were conducted using a structured interview guide. Data were analysed using an inductive content analysis. The results indicated that gymnasts were most fearful of injuries because of the difficulty in returning from an injury and being unable to participate in practices and competitions while injured. Gymnasts described aspects of their past performance experience, such as success, consistency and communication with significant others, as important sources of self-efficacy. Some examples of psychological strategies used to overcome their fear of injury were mental preparation (e.g. imagery, relaxation), just "going for a skill" and the coaches' influence.

AB - It has been suggested that the psychological stress associated with competitive sports events may help to explain the increased susceptibility to respiratory infections due to reductions in secretory immunity. In the current study, we investigated the influence of competitive exercise and psychological stress on secretory immunoglobulin A (s-IgA). Salivary s-IgA and heart rate were measured in 62 healthy young recreationally active men at rest and, in a between-subjects design, following one of four 8-min tasks: mental arithmetic, cycling at workloads of 60 to 180 W (mean =146 W), mental arithmetic while cycling, or competitive cycling. Mental arithmetic was associated with significant increases in s-IgA concentration (mean = 49 μg × min -1 ) and s-IgA secretion rate (mean = 25 μg × min -1 ) compared with rest, while mental arithmetic combined with exercise was associated with a significant increase in s-IgA concentration only (mean = 124 μg × min -1 ). In contrast, competitive exercise and exercise alone did not influence s-IgA concentration or secretion rate. Heart rate increased modestly to mental arithmetic (mean = 7 beats × min -1 ) and substantially, and similarly, to the three exercise tasks (mean = 56(62 beats × min -1 ). The hypothesis that the psychological stress of competitive exercise contributes to increased susceptibility to infection via reductions in s-IgA requires further investigation.

AB - The purpose of this study was to investigate whether psychosocial factors, such as stress, anxiety, social support, and coping skills, could predict injuries (frequency and duration) among 105 ballet dancers (101 females; 4 males). The dancers were professional ballet dancers (n = 27), university ballet students (n = 19), and ballet institute students (n = 59), with a mean age of 20.46 years (SD = 5.50). They completed a modified version of the Adolescent Perceived Event Scale (APES) and Sport Experiences Survey (SES), which address life and dance stress respectively, the Sport Anxiety Scale (SAS), the Athletic Coping Skills Inventory-28 (ACSI-28), and a social support for dance measure. Injuries were recorded (frequency and duration of injuries) for the 10-month period following completion of the surveys. From the correlation matrix of psychosocial scales and injury, we selected for regression analysis, variables that showed at least moderate correlations with the frequency and duration of injury (i.e., peaking under pressure, goal setting/mental preparation, freedom from worry, confidence, negative dance stress, negative life stress). One regression analysis identified freedom from worry and confidence as significant predictors for frequency of injury. A second regression analysis identified freedom from worry and negative dance stress as significant predictors for duration of injury.

AB - The present study was conducted to explore the effects of sports participation on competency, skill development, and school connectedness in adolescent girls and to identify possible mediating variables between sports participation and decreased risk of various negative outcomes. One objective was to identify specific competencies related to sports participation that support the premise that sports participation serves as a protective factor against negative outcomes and is a means of promoting healthy adolescent development. Six hundred and seventy-seven adolescent girls who were participating in high school volleyball completed four questionnaires: a competency questionnaire measuring scholastic competence, social acceptance, athletic competence, close friendship, and self-worth; a school connectedness questionnaire; a sports participation questionnaire; and a demographic questionnaire. The present study looked at amount of sports participation as well as the participants' team level, age, grade, and percentage playing time, to determine which factors were most associated with competency and school connectedness. Girls' feelings of social acceptance were significantly associated with scholastic sports participation in 7th grade. Further, girls' self perceived athletic competence increased with age, team level, playing time on their current teams, and as a function of both scholastic and non-scholastic sports participation. As compared to a national sample (Bonny et al., 2000), our participants demonstrated significantly greater feelings of school connectedness. Thus, these results suggest that merely being a member of a sports team is associated with significant feelings of connection to one's school. Furthermore, scholastic sports participation in the 10th and 11th grades and playing time on one's current team demonstrated an additional and statistically significant association with school connectedness.

AB - Domestic violence, often referred to as intimate partner violence (IPV), is a pervasive problem and often includes physical, psychological, verbal and sexual abuse. These types of violent acts are generally seen with men as the perpetrators and women as victims. In recent years, studies have revealed that minority women, African-American women in particular, fall victim to all types of IPV at rates higher than Caucasian females. While research shows a large percentage of minority women as victims of IPV, there is not a great deal of information on how IPV begins and impacts the lives of African-American women. Studies have primarily focused on the many factors that put a woman at risk for becoming victimized. As no protective factors for IPV have been identified, it has been found that sports participation can be very beneficial to women (Berry & Howe, 2000; Brown & Blanton, 2002; Carlson, McNutt, Choi, & Rose, 2002; Fields, 2000; Kuga & Douctre, 1994; Lamb, 1999; Powers, 2000; Taub and Blinde, 1992). As the literature lists many qualities about sports participation, none have looked for a link between IPV and sports participation. The current study originally proposed that there would be a difference between occurrences of IPV-related instances in African-American women's lives depending upon sports participation, based on the data that shows that the act of playing a sport can increase the self-efficacy and/or self-esteem of young girls and women. These pieces of literature led this researcher to search to see if the beneficial factors of sports participation would also protect against IPV in the romantic relationships of African-American women. The current study surveyed 30 African-American female participants over the age of 18. The results of this study, in fact, failed to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between IPV-related instances experienced by the women in this sample, regardless of sports participation.

AB - Athlete burnout has been defined as the psychological, emotional, and sometimes physical withdrawal from a sporting activity formerly perceived as enjoyable as a consequence of chronic stress. The syndrome is thought to involve components of emotional/physical exhaustion, a reduced sense of sport-related accomplishment, and sport devaluation. Some variables believed to give rise to athlete burnout include boredom, pressure from coaches and parents, and unfulfilled personal performance expectations; however, more research has been necessary to uncover possible origins of such antecedents. The purpose of the current investigation was to determine whether achievement goal theory could offer an explanation of the burnout phenomenon. One-hundred-and-three NCAA Division III athletes from the same university participated in the current study. Eleven coaches from their respective teams were also included in the sample. Support for a traditional achievement goal theory perspective was obtained with regard to predicting athlete burnout. Generally, those with goal profiles characterized by a high task/low ego orientation had the lowest levels of burnout. High task/high ego oriented athletes fared somewhat worse, followed by those with profiles marked by a low task and a high ego orientation. Low task/low ego oriented athletes had the highest severity of burnout. Such findings ran contrary to notions that the optimal goal profile would be high task/high ego. Burnout severity was further predicted by the degree of congruence between perceived motivational climate of the team and athlete goal orientation. Specifically, congruence was found to exert a protective effect on burnout, suggesting the importance of the athlete-environment fit. For women in particular, this held true. It was only when the degree of congruence was considered that it was possible to predict women's vulnerability to burnout. Generally, for cases in which congruence did not buffer symptoms, those who fared the best were athletes whose levels of ego orientation exceeded their perceptions of a performance climate along with those whose perceptions of a mastery climate exceeded their levels of task orientation. Results are discussed in terms of implications for theory, future research, and practice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - In the sports psychology literature, goal setting intervention studies have been a popular area of research the last ten years (Burton, 2001). Previous research demonstrates that goal setting is the most consistent and effective performance enhancement strategy in the behavioral sciences and seems to have a positive impact on performance (Burton et al., 2003; Locke & Latham, 1990). A "roadmap" detailing how to implement a periodized goal-setting program was developed, and its effectiveness was assessed using a quasi-experimental, multiple baseline case study design. Participants were six female members of a collegiate tennis team in the Northwest who ranged in age between 18-22 years. Several instruments were used to assess the effectiveness of the goal setting intervention, including: the Sports Motivation Scale (SMS), Task and Ego Orientation Sports Questionnaire (TEOSQ), Theories of Talent Scale (TOTS), Athletic Coping Skills Inventory (ACSI-28), Trait Sport Confidence Inventory (TSCI), and the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (MPS). All of these instruments have been documented to possess solid psychometric properties. Goal term length was periodized into three duration increments, including: long-term (macro), short-term (micro), and intermediate-term (meso) goals. Intervention effectiveness was assessed using both quantitative and qualitative analysis to assess self-confidence and performance. Questionnaires were administered (a) pre-intervention to establish a baseline prior to implementing the goal setting program; and (b) post-intervention after the Fall competitive season ended. Qualitative assessment consisted of daily goal setting logs, competition match plan and evaluation logs, coaching staff evaluation of goals logs, and ethnographic data collected from weekly individual meetings. Data analysis consists of constructing case studies based on a combination of quantitative and qualitative data and assessing program effectiveness for each athlete using a multiple baseline design. Due in part to the large amount of information and new skills thrown at the players about mental training, it was expected that the intervention process would prompt temporary declines in trait self-confidence, which if given sufficient time, eventually would rebound to new higher levels. Moreover, state self-confidence was expected to demonstrate similar patterns but display rebound effects more strongly and quickly. While this prediction was accurate for three of the athletes, two players demonstrated a slight decrease in their confidence levels across this eight-week intervention and one player's confidence decreased significantly. For the three players who demonstrated overall trait confidence increases, their confidence mirrored surprising goals in their technical and tactical abilities and performance. State self-confidence scores reflected a similar pattern, with three of the players showing improvement on the self-confidence/achievement motivation and goal setting/mental preparation subscales of the ACSI-28 whereas three did not. The three players whose confidence did not rebound to pre-intervention levels seemed to focus more on social comparison. While minimal change was expected on the secondary nontargeted variables because they were not specifically addressed by the intervention, the expected impact of the self-confidence rebound did seem to indirectly impact secondary variables, including: freedom from worry, (i.e., 5 athletes showed improvement), concentration (i.e., 4 athletes showed improvement); peaking under pressure (i.e., 3 athletes improved), and coachability (i.e., 3 athletes improved). Most players also demonstrated a moderately high learning belief about talent and high task and moderate ego orientations, suggesting they were becoming more process oriented...

AB - The experience of being famous is investigated through interviews with 15 well-known American celebrities. The interviews detail the existential parameters of being famous in contemporary culture. Research participants are celebrities in various societal categories: government, law, business, publishing, sports, music, film, television news and entertainment (including morning, daytime, primetime, and late night television personalities). Transcendental Phenomenology is the qualitative method used, examining textural and structural relationship-to-world themes. The study finds that in relation to self; being famous leads to: entitization (depersonalization); loss of privacy; expectations; ego gratification; and symbolic immortality. In relation to other, being famous leads to: wealth; access; temptation; mistrust; and familial concerns. Celebrity is experienced as a process through four phases: love/hate; addiction; acceptance, and adaptation. Implications and applications for the fields of psychology, sociology, and communication are outlined. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - The extant literature in sport psychology has viewed attentional style, pain coping, and locus of control as independent constructs. The purpose of this study was to conduct a multiple correlation analysis of the attentional style, pain perception, and response to injury relationship in a Division 1 collegiate football population, and thereby study the relationship of these variables to one another within a high collision sport. It was hypothesized that attentional style, pain coping, and locus of control would demonstrate a significant relationship to each other, total number of injuries sustained, and competitive time missed due to injury. Undergraduate football players (N = 73) completed the Test of Attentional and Interpersonal Style (TAIS), the Sports Inventory for Pain (SIP), and the Beliefs about Pain Control Questionnaire (BPCQ) prior to a 12 game season, and injury data was obtained. Results indicate that attentional style and pain coping were found to correlate with each other but not with locus of control. Injuries sustained and competitive time missed did not correlate with predicted variables. The theorized relationship between attention and pain coping in athletes is discussed and future research opportunities are highlighted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - In recent years, much has been learned about the beneficial role of psychological skills (e.g., goal setting, stress management) in rehabilitation from injury. Several authors (e.g., Cramer Roh & Perna, 2000; Misasi, Richmond, & Kemler, 1998) suggest that athletic trainers are ideal to teach athletes psychological skills. The most effective way to integrate psychological skills in rehabilitation may be to have athletic trainers work with athletes on both the physical and psychological recovery from injury. Previous research by Roepke (1993) suggested that when athletic trainers are educated about sport psychology rehabilitation interventions, they tend to become proficient in the use of such interventions, and they consider the interventions effective. The primary goal of this study was to determine whether athletic trainers incorporate psychological skills in their work with injured athletes after receiving training in using such skills. Another goal was to assess changes in athletic trainers' attitudes (e.g., importance) with regard to incorporating psychological skills in rehabilitation. A third goal was to determine whether a brief intervention program training athletic trainers in the delivery of sport psychology rehabilitation interventions increases trainers' confidence in using such skills. Other goals related to athletes' perceptions were unable to be tested due to insufficient data. Due to low enrollment and completion rates for the study (N = 8), an additional purpose became soliciting athletic trainers to find out why they did not participate. Responses to this survey by athletic trainers and athletic training students ( N = 25) indicated that time constraints were a primary reason for non-participation. Those who did complete the study reported an increase in perceived skill level relative to using psychological techniques with injured athletes, and also reported that they thought, overall, that they used the techniques more. This latter statement was not corroborated with the data from daily reports, but does demonstrate a perceived shift in behavior. There was no change in athletic trainers' perception of the importance of psychological skills following the educational program. Low enrollment and limited compliance with the research protocol weakened the findings of this study. Implications for further work, including several alternate designs, are discussed.

AB - This investigation reports on the development and validation of the Athlete-Counseling Self-Efficacy Scale (ACSES). The ACSES is a new 29-item multidimensional measure which assesses individuals' confidence in their ability to perform specific skills related to competent athlete-counseling. Factor analysis of data from 306 psychologists and psychology graduate students yielded three factors: (a) Sport Culture Specific Knowledge/Skills, (b) Basic Athlete-Counseling Skills, and (c) Special Athlete Issues. The first factor, Sport Culture-Specific Knowledge/Skills, assesses how confident one is in his or her ability to communicate specific information related to athletes, sport culture, and the sport environment, and to integrate this knowledge into his or her work and counseling process with athletes. The second factor, Basic Athlete-Counseling Therapy Skills, assesses one's confidence in performing basic therapy skills with athlete clients. The third factor, Special Athlete Issues, assesses one's confidence to successfully manage and negotiate multicultural issues and typical diagnoses commonly found within sport environments. The ACSES factors were found to explain a significant proportion of the total variance (61.5%), and to have excellent internal consistency (alpha;s = .97, .90, and .84, respectively). The ACSES scales were moderately related to a measure of general counseling self-efficacy, minimally related to a measure of social desirability, and able to differentiate among participants with differing levels of counseling experience. The scale scores were also related to interest in athlete-counseling, number of athlete clients counseled, and extent of training in sport psychology. The two primary uses for the ACSES are thought to be for the purposes of general athlete-counseling research and athlete-counselor training. Avenues of research for which the ACSES would be valuable include the investigation of the process of athlete-counseling, and the investigation of the athlete-counseling skills and behaviors related to positive athlete-counseling outcomes. The ACSES could also potentially be used to examine how confident professionals in close working relationships with athletes (e.g., coaches, athletic trainers, performance enhancement consultants) are in providing competent athlete-counseling services. Related to athlete-counseling training, the ACSES could prove to be helpful in the identification and development of course materials, practical experiences, and supervision interventions that best contribute to increasing athlete-counseling self-efficacy. Ultimately, as the only instrument presently capable of measuring athlete-counseling self-efficacy, it is thought that the ACSES could be an important impetus for growth within the field of sport psychology by providing the means to better understand, evaluate, and improve athlete-counseling competency.

The population consisted of 26 players administered two comprehensive psychometric tests, the 16 Personality Factor Questionnaire (16PF) and the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-2. The Tough Mindedness scale (scale B) of the 16 PF was used along with all the scales of the STAXI-2 in the analyses. Single group (one-tail) z-tests were performed comparing the mean data of the hockey players with that of the adult male normative samples of each test. Results generally supported the hypotheses that while not pathologically angry or aggressive, hockey players do accept, use, and even respect the use of some degrees of aggression beyond the adult male normative levels. Discussion of social learning approaches to understanding sports aggression resulted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Sensitive measurement of the sequelae of sports-related concussion is vital in order for trainers and team physicians to make informed decisions about when an athlete may safely return to play. To this end, the most valuable studies of sports-related concussion should seek to understand the physiological changes that follow concussion, as well as the neuropsychological manifestations of these changes. In the realm of cognition, previous studies have characterized verbal memory deficits following concussion, but the literature on visuospatial memory functions following concussion is sparse. Moreover, the two memory domains have not been simultaneously investigated in any published studies. This study evaluated the physiological changes following concussion that underlie both verbal and visuospatial memory abilities through fMRI imaging of hippocampal integrity in high school athletes. Recent developments in fMRI analysis techniques provide an interesting method to examine how the functional connectivity of the brain is affected by concussion. In this method, low frequency signal fluctuation, traditionally thought to represent functional coherence, is used as an index of brain dysfunction. Because concussion involves a decrease in functional neural connectivity, this index was expected to provide a useful measure of such injury. Moreover, it was expected that the index would correlate with performances on neuropsychological measures of verbal and visuospatial memory. However, in the present study, the low frequency fluctuation in the fMRI signal did not differentiate between concussed high school football players and controls. Moreover, there were no group differences found in either verbal or visuospatial memory measures. There are several confounding factors that may explain the lack of significant findings in the present study, but ultimately, these findings call into question the ability of traditional neuropsychological memory measures and new methods of fMRI-derived indices of functional coherence to detect the subtle deficits that follow sports-related concussion.

AB - The purposes of this study were to determine the personal and situational factors that predict participants' coping styles in response to sport-related stressful events, to determine the relationships between the acute stressors, appraisal, and coping styles, and to determine the extent to which the coping process differs among athletes as a function of gender and skill level. A total of 400 college athletes as participants were selected from China. Five stress factors were abstracted from 20 stressors by exploratory factor analysis. MANOVA and Chi-square results indicated that skill level significantly influenced the athletes' perceived intensity of the stress sources, appraisals, and coping style, while gender significantly affected participants' appraisals and coping styles. Three stress sources (Threats-from-Others, Coach-Dissatisfaction, and Environmental-Sources) and two appraisals (Control-by-Self and Control-by-Others) significantly predicted the athlete's coping style. Results of the study supported the transactional coping theory in which coping with stress is a function of both personal and situational factors. It was also concluded that athletes' coping styles is a function of gender and skill level. Implications of these findings for stress management training are discussed.

AB - Within professional psychology data has recently accumulated suggesting that traditional efforts to change or control thoughts and emotions have limits in their effectiveness (Roemer & Orsillo, 2002; Segal, Williams, & Teasdale, 2002). Similarly, within applied sport psychology, empirical support for the efficacy of traditional approaches for performance enhancement has been equivocal (Moore, 2003). Alternative intervention options have recently been proposed useful for the enhancement of athletic performance (Gardner and Moore, in press). The purpose of this study was to preliminarily investigate the potential efficacy of a Mindfulness-Acceptance-Commitment based performance enhancement strategy with collegiate athletes (MAC: Gardner and Moore, in press). Eleven field hockey and volleyball athletes participated in a 7 week MAC protocol, and were compared to a control group of 7 same sport athletes. Non-parametric analysis of data offers preliminary support for MAC as a strategy for enhancing the athletic performance of collegiate athletes, and is a promising new model requiring further research. In addition, results indicate that the presence or absence of subsyndromal clinical issues may be an important contributing factor in performance enhancement efforts, a novel finding of potentially great significance for the future development of applied sport psychology.

The study was carried out on 32 national level table-tennis players in the age group of 12-17 years. The Psychological performance inventory (Loehr, 1982) was administered to assess their mental toughness on seven variables viz. self confidence, negative-energy, Attentional control, visual and Imagery control, motivational level, positive energy and attitude control. The data obtained was analyzed using ANOVA, t test and percentage distribution. The results indicate that all the 3 psychological interventions enhanced mental toughness dimensions of sports persons. However combined intervention consisting of both relaxation and imagery therapies showed the maximum effect on mental toughness dimensions.

AB - For much of the past century, community sport enthusiasts and educators, as well as parents and average citizens, have lauded the psychological benefits of sport involvement for youth participants (Coakley, 1998; Sage, 1990). Characteristics such as positive self-perceptions, self-confidence, social consciousness, self-motivation, and the ability to cope with stress are some examples of the benefits. What is clear today is that these benefits, as well as many others, do not automatically result from involvement in sport (European Federation of Sport Psychology, 1996). Both positive and negative attitudes and behaviors are learned in the sport environment. Many professionals advocate holistic, developmental, or educational mental skills instruction with youth populations (Danish et al, 1995; Vealey, 1988; Weiss, 1995). There have, however, been few examples of the actual work between sport psychology consultants and youths in sport environments. This chapter addresses this limitation. First, we describe support for integrated approaches suitable for teaching youth physical and mental skills. We offer integrated instruction as the central theoretical construct that drives our practice. Second, we discuss some of the developmental concerns of working with young athletes. Third, we present examples of integrated instruction in action as the relationship develops between a sport psychologist and participants of various age-group teams. Finally, we draw some implications related to structuring mental skill development in the youth sport environment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)

AB - In sport psychology, mental skills help athletes enhance their performance as well as their enjoyment of participation. The same concepts and principles can be applied to many areas of performance. Although the majority of my applied work has been with athletes, I also work with dancers, singers, actors, and business people (I am currently working with a group of accountants). Anyone who is interested in performing can benefit from developing skills of self-reflection, anxiety control, concentration and attention, and self-confidence. When I first began working with dancers, a few factors caught my attention as being somewhat different from working with athletes. Generally speaking, their concept of personal space is less obvious. Greeting each other with hugs and kisses, although commonplace among dancers, would be fairly rare for most sports teams. Touching seems to be part of the communication system for some dancers. At first it was rather disconcerting to have the hand of someone I did not really know on my arm when speaking. Whether due to my increased involvement as a psychologist with performing artists or my own personal participation in Latin dance, I no longer find the touching to be strange or uncomfortable. My expectations regarding personal space, however, do vary depending on the performance area of my clients. Rather than take the readers through a single session or a series of sessions from start to finish, I instead provide a series of snapshots from sessions with a dancer. The dancer in this chapter (let's call her Tracy) is an amalgamation of about 12 dancers. I have selected topics that a large percentage of dancers with whom I have worked found to be important. My aim is to familiarize readers with some of the issues in the performance area of dance while at the same time providing some insight into the way I practice.

The consultant, Dr. Lynn Seiser, offers a detailed discussion on how imagery can be taught to coaches and athletes and used to facilitate training and competitive efforts. The coach, E.J. McGuire, provides his perspective on the use of mental imagery in professional hockey. Finally, the athlete, professional hockey player Eric Weinrich, describes how he uses imagery to enhance his play on ice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)

AB - Hardly a day goes by without mention in the media of an athlete experiencing alcohol- or drug-related problems. In addition, it is often the case that violent behaviors, ranging from barroom altercations to homicide, are associated with alcohol use and abuse. If athletes are experiencing alcohol-related difficulties, it is a fair assumption that their health and well-being and certainly their athletic performances have deteriorated, or will deteriorate, as a result. Therefore, coaches and other professionals interested in the welfare of athletes (e.g., sport psychologists, athletic trainers, sport physicians, counselors) would be well advised to familiarize themselves with the incidence and prevalence of alcohol use and abuse and violence among the athletes they serve. This knowledge is the first step toward developing a strategy for preventing these problems from occurring and reacting constructively when they do occur. Our primary goal in writing this chapter is to familiarize the reader with a clinical approach to intervening with and facilitating change in an athlete (in this case a college football player) who presents with problems related to his alcohol use and violence. In keeping with this goal, the case study in this chapter is the focal point from which we hope to pass along our primary message to the reader, which is an effective method for helping an athlete with alcohol problems. Our principal lessons are incorporated into the commentary in the dialogue between the sport psychologist and the athlete. Additional matters of clinical importance are covered in the section Professional Issues following the case study. Before embarking on the case study, however, we present background information on alcohol use among college students generally (and college athletes specifically) and on issues concerning risk taking and alcohol-related violence in these populations. We also provide information on how and why individuals change problem drinking, on how helping professionals can facilitate this process, and on components frequently found in specialized alcohol treatment programs.

AB - Professional psychological associations (e.g., the Association of Multicultural Counseling and Development, a division of the American Counseling Association, American Psychological Association, Joint Task Force of Divisions 45 and 17) have responded to the calls for multicultural training and sensitivity in applied psychology service and in research. After a 20-plus-year effort among many psychologists of color, the American Psychological Association (APA) adopted the Guidelines on Multicultural Education, Training, Research, Practice and Organizational Change for Psychologists (2003) as an "official" document, thus raising the bar of professional practice expectations for all association members. In 2001, then Surgeon General of the United States, David Satcher, released a report titled Mental Health: Culture, Race and Ethnicity , wherein the adverse effect of racism on the mental health of cultural, ethnic, and racial communities is clearly articulated. This document represents the first time the U.S. government has come on board with an "official" recognition of racism as a significant mental health problem. The question now is, how will sport psychology organizations such as the Association for the Advancement of Applied Sport Psychology and the International Society of Sport Psychology respond to the challenges of multicultural service provision, and in what form will those responses appear? A comment on the chapter, by Heather Gridley, follows. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)

AB - Review of book Inner Strength: The Mental Dynamics of Athletic Performance by Ralph A. Vernacchia. This is a terrific new book for sport psychologists, coaches, and athletes around the world. Ralph Vernacchia has drawn on his many years of experience in sport psychology and coaching education to provide readers with an easy to read and thought provoking mental training book. Also included in the book are several exercises and techniques which have been developed by other well known practicing sport psychologists. Vernacchia captures the attention of his audience by using intriguing methods to help them understand the process necessary to achieving peak performance. Readers are taught to look within to discover the tools necessary for athletic superiority. This 270-page book is separated into three distinct sections, each serving as a building block to the next. The first section lays the foundation by reviewing peak performance components. The primary focus of the second section is on mastering the inner basics of peak performance. The final section of the book focuses on mastering the "Four C's of Peak Performance," which are concentration, confidence, composure, and commitment in order to improve athletic performance. Coaches and athletes can use this book as a medium to discuss and develop improved athletic performance. Anyone interested in achieving or helping others achieve athletic success should consider owning a copy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - Recently, a whole range of degree courses in sports science have sprung up, and here is a bright new textbook to support them. This appears to be a good basic undergraduate text, with chapters on imagery, motivation, concentration, anxiety, teamwork etc. The chapter on the athlete's career interested me for its curious parallel with the career of the scientific research worker--a standard trajectory seems to be up to 10 years of intense preparation, leading to mastery [or PhDery] at about 24, followed by up to 10 years of peak performance, declining thenceforward into administration, coaching or teaching. The main difference as far as I can judge from this book is that the sportsmen get paid better, and get more counselling and guidance through the later stages. Most of this book is not directly relevant to the readers of this journal, except for the final chapter on exercise and mental health. There is clear evidence of a relationship between exercise and the alleviation of some of the symptoms of some mental disorders, particularly depression. There is also clear evidence of a link between excessive exercising and some disorders such as anorexia nervosa. It is, unfortunately, not entirely clear which way causality lies. It seems to me to be likely that exercise therapy will remain down there with psychoanalysis in terms of scientific credibility, owing, in both cases, to the impossibility of conducting double-blind studies. These matters are clearly and intelligently discussed here, making this chapter, at least, worthy of attention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - The increasingly business-like environment of professional sport has resulted in greater scrutiny and analysis of players' performance. The roles of physiological parameters in predicting success in the world of professional and amateur sport are well established. However, to date, evidence is sparse concerning the role of personality traits in predicting such success. The present study examined the potency of measures of personality style and mental skills in predicting success in the criterion sport of professional rugby league. Mental toughness was assessed by questionnaire using the Psychological Performance Inventory. Hardiness was assessed by questionnaire using the Personal Views Survey III-R. Subjects in this study were 115 professional rugby league footballers representing the top three playing levels in the game in Great Britain (International, Super League, and Division One). Findings demonstrated that performers playing at the highest standard (International players) scored significantly higher in all three hardiness subscales (commitment, control and challenge) and in two of the seven mental toughness subscales (negative energy control and attention control). Results are discussed relative to previous findings, in particular, of the efficacy of high levels of hardiness. Practical implications focus on the advocacy of mental toughness and hardiness training to improve sports performance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - The current status of commonly used mental imagery measures in the field of sport psychology is reviewed in this paper. Standards for determining psychometric adequacy are summarized and then referred to in the scale review process. It is concluded that the reviewed mental imagery scales, while useful in contributing to a greater understanding of mental imagery, are inadequate as they have not been fully tested or are conceptually and psychometrically limited. Generally scale developers have employed small or inappropriate samples during the scale development and evaluation phases and have rarely tested for response biases. Meanings assigned to scale response options by respondents are inconsistent due to undefined anchor points. Instructions to respondents are often ambiguous, and users' manuals and norms are usually non-existent. Hence, further work is needed on improving current mental imagery measures so that they conform to recommended standards.

AB - The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between self-confidence, anxiety, and mood states in collegiate tennis players. The Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2 (CSAI-2) and the Profile of Mood States (POMS) were utilized based on their ability to assess a number of different psychological states thought to be crucial for proper mental preparation prior to athletic competition as well as for their psychometric properties. These inventories were employed to determine pre-competition levels of anxiety, self-confidence and mood disturbance and their relationship to successful or unsuccessful tennis match outcome. Twenty-four collegiate tennis players completed the POMS and CSAI-2 30 minutes prior to their tennis match during their participation in the NCAA Regional (VII) Team Tennis Tournament. Results revealed winning tennis players displayed significantly higher self-confidence, lower cognitive and somatic anxiety levels, and lower total mood disturbance scores than losing players. In addition, winning tennis players exhibited the iceberg profile on the POMS, which is consistent with the findings in similar research conducted with successful athletes in other sports. As such, athletes who displayed high self-confidence and low anxiety levels were potentially able to remain calm and relaxed under pressure and were not as affected by negative events. Furthermore, these results suggest that mental state prior to the start of a tennis match plays a crucial role in overall success or failure.

AB - Reviews "The Mental Athlete," by Kay Porter. In this 210-page book, the connection between mental, emotional, and physical competencies is highlighted and elaborated upon by including the spiritual side of athletic training. Spiritual, in this sense, does not imply daily conversations with higher beings, but rather a knowing of one's inner self. It's more of a "who you are" and "what do you want out of sport and life approach." When presenting goal-setting techniques, the author addressed how to let go of a goal that may not be realistic (after an injury, for example) and training down mentally to restart the goal setting process. The use of imagery was a dominant theme throughout the book. The majority of the book was written for and would appeal to athletes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Mental toughness, stemming in part from Loehr's 1986 classic research, is widely alluded to as a critical variable in the popular media and applied sport psychology. We evaluated the construct validity of responses to Loehr's (1986) Psychological Performance Inventory (PPI) by 263 student-athletes from an elite sports high school. As confirmatory factor analysis yielded a poor model fit and an improper solution for the a priori model, we pursued exploratory factor analyses that resulted in a 5-factor model that fitted the data well. However, further analyses showed that key correlates of mental toughness were more strongly correlated with the factors based on the original structure than factors based on the alternative structure. In conclusion, neither the original PPI nor the subset of PPI items in the better-fitting alternative model was a sound measure of mental toughness, indicating that a good fit is a necessary but not sufficient condition for construct validation. Good instrumentation must be strong in terms of conceptual/theoretical considerations, psychometric properties, and relationships to key correlates hypothesized to be meaningfully related to it.

In sport psychology, the concept of mental imagery is often used to describe an activity involving mental repetition, mental practice or mental rehearsal. In this review, both visual and kinesthetic imagery are defined and the classical paradigm used by researchers to study mental imagery is described. Several methodological factors that may influence the effects of mental imagery on the acquisition of motor skills and performance are also reviewed. Additionally, various functions of mental imagery, including goal cognition, motivation, Image-Somatic response-Meaning, concentration, preparation, and memorization are discussed. Finally, the equivalence of mental imagery and physical practice is examined from a psychoneurological perspective. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - Reviews the book "Exercise and Sport in Feminist Therapy: Constructing Modalities and Assessing Outcomes" edited by Ruth L. Hall and Carole A. Oglesby. The reviewer argues that these editors have taken on a wonderful and daunting challenge: bringing together practitioners and researchers in feminist therapy and in exercise and sport psychology to address the physical and mental health benefits of women's adoption and maintenance of an active lifestyle. Because the perspectives and foci range so widely, only a small number of researchers and practitioners would be naturally and obviously drawn to such a volume: those who have already been exploring the invigorating and empowering embodiment of holistic feminism. The reviewer comments on the opportunity provided by this volume to engage and educate those with knowledge of only one side of the equation. To that end, this volume presents a grounded and engaged perspective. The reviewer also mentions a few minor quibbles which may be laid at the doorstep either of the editors or publisher: inconsistent proofreading results in more than a fair share of typographical and homonymic errors, and frustratingly, the chapter headers reflect only the book's sections, rather than giving indication of author or chapter titles.

AB - The value of various forms of physical activity, exercise and sport for the promotion of mental health has been emphasised in recent research and intervention programmes. This research investigated the relationship between sports involving diverse types of regular exercise, namely hockey and health club activities (team and individual sports involving relatively more aerobic and resistance exercise respectively), and various components of psychological well-being and physical self-perception. Comparisons between 60 university hockey players, 27 health club members and 111 non-exercising students revealed that both hockey players and health club members were generally more psychologically well and had more positive physical self-perception than non-exercising students. Hockey players had significantly higher means than health club members on positive relations with others, sports competence and sport importance. While health club members' means were clearly higher than hockey players on environmental mastery and perceptions of body attractiveness, these relationships did not reach statistical significance. The relevance of these findings and further implications for health, exercise and sport psychological research and interventions are discussed.

These six problems were analyzed in line of theory and practice. The approaches to solve these problems were also proposed. It is pointed out that the exploration of these problems will help sport psychology to make contribution to the development of its mother science, i.e. psychology.

AB - Despite the regular use and growing popularity of performance enhancement interventions among sport psychology professionals, numerous cautions and questions have been raised regarding the efficacy of the most common procedures (goal setting, imagery, self-talk, arousal regulation, and multi-component interventions) for use with competitive athletes. Thus, in an effort to inform both the research and practice of sport psychology, this structured qualitative review applied the standard criteria for the determination of empirically supported interventions to the empirical research on the use of these interventions with competitive athletes. Results indicate that these intervention procedures have not met the standards required for designation as efficacious interventions for the direct enhancement of athletic performance with competitive athletes. These findings accentuate the necessity for additional methodologically sound empirical research, suggest cautious idiographic use of the traditional performance enhancement procedures utilized in sport psychology practice, and encourage consideration for the adaptation of existing approaches and the development of innovative approaches to performance enhancement that may more effectively promote the achievement of optimal performance states among athletes.

AB - This study examined self-silencing behavior among female high school athletes and nonathletes. Participants attended either a single-sex school or a coed school and either played individual or team sports or did not participate in any sporting activity. The Piers Harris Self Concept Scale and the Silencing the Self Scale were administered to 141 participants. Although no significant interactions among-other variables were found, analysis of covariance yielded one significant main effect: between the mean score of self-silencing score of athletes and nonathletes, suggesting that athletes exhibit less self-silencing behavior than nonathletes. These results were consistent among girls who attended single-sex school and coed schools. Chi-square analysis of the demographic questionnaire yielded significance on fathers who either played or did not play sports and the age the participant began playing sports. Fathers, as a whole, had influence on whether their daughters played sports and the age at which they began. Results of this study suggest that sports programs for adolescent females increase positive self-esteem and decrease the use of self-silencing behaviors. These findings validate the importance of sports involvement among high school female students and contribute to the growing literature on the use of self-silencing behavior among females.

AB - Excessive force in professional contact and semi-contact sports has become more prevalent. Legislative proposals, league self regulation, civil liability, and criminal prosecution, have all been employed in efforts to create general and specific deterrents to the use of excessive force in sports. Nevertheless, these various mechanisms have proven to be ineffective in curbing the problem. In addition, despite increasing public concern regarding the incidence of violent images, there remains a viewing market for contact and semi-contact sports. This dissertation reviews the various theories advanced to explain society's perpetual attraction to violent images in entertainment. It explores the willingness of athletes to resort to acts of excessive force. It reviews the legal mechanisms that have been employed unsuccessfully to deter and punish these acts. Finally, recommendations will be offered for using a specifically developed regulatory scheme, in conjunction with existing law, to reduce violent images in sports, while maintaining the quality and integrity of professional athletic competition.

AB - This study sought to test the effectiveness of self-regulatory skill training, anxiety reduction training, and a combination of these approaches in assisting athletes to combat choking in a pressure-filled situation. The impact of training on dart throwing performance, anxiety, self-efficacy, goal setting, attributions, adaptive responses, and self-reactions was explored. Forty-five males and thirty-five females (N = 80) who qualified as intermediate dart throwers and chokers participated on two separate occasions. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three experimental groups or a control group based on the presence or absence of anxiety reduction and self-regulatory skill training. All data analyses were conducted on data collected during the second assessment period under stressed conditions, except for an evaluation of choking between the first and second assessment periods under stressed conditions. It was hypothesized that compared to an anxiety reduction training group or a control group, chokers who received self-regulatory skill training would, under stressed conditions, display significantly higher dart throwing, higher self-efficacy beliefs for dart throwing, more process-oriented goals, more technique-oriented attributions, more technique-oriented adaptive responses, and higher self-reaction. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that compared to a control group, chokers who received self-regulatory skill training or anxiety reduction training would show significantly less performance anxiety prior to stressed test conditions. Finally, those chokers who received the combination of self-regulatory skill training and anxiety reduction training would, under stressed test conditions, show significantly less dart-throwing anxiety compared to all other groups. Partial support was found for the hypotheses. Most significantly, results supported the utility of self-regulatory skill training in combating choking, with those participants who received this form of training performing significantly higher than participants from all other groups on a test of dart throwing performance under stressed conditions. Chi-square analysis indicated a significant association between treatment and goal setting, attributions, and adaptive response in accordance with the hypothesis. The remaining hypotheses were not supported, although the self-regulatory skill training group came very close to meeting statistical significance on measures of self-efficacy, self-reaction, and anxiety. Findings are discussed in terms of clinical implication for coaches and athletes combating choking in athletic competition. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Research in the field of applied sport psychology has been expanding at an incredible rate over the last few years. Much of this research focuses on the application of performance-enhancement techniques and skills with professional, amateur-elite, and collegiate athletes. However, nowhere is it documented that a sport psychology program has ever been designed and implemented in the secondary school setting. This dissertation was conducted for the purpose of expanding the literature in school sport psychology consultation. The author utilized a case study method, which was anchored by Maher's Program Planning and Evaluation Framework in a public school setting to design the first ever documented case of a public school sport psychology program for high school student-athletes and coaches. The program planning and evaluation approach is comprised of four phases: clarification, design, implementation, and evaluation. Using this approach, the consultant identified the client and relevant stakeholders as well as assessed the needs of student-athletes and coaches. These needs were then considered within the larger organizational context of the public school system. Next, information from these needs assessment and context assessments were used to design and initiate three sport psychology programs. Three teams were offered a number of educational services by the sport psychology consultant including: team educational sessions, individual educational sessions, and on-site consultations. Finally, at the end of the season, the consultant engaged in program development activities to evoke feedback from coaches, administrators, and parents regarding the feasibility of this program. The findings of this dissertation suggest that the program planning and evaluation approach can be successfully applied within a public school athletic context as a framework for school sport psychology programs. The implications of this study for the field of applied sport psychology, professional psychology, and school psychologists are discussed.

AB - The relationship between mental imagery and athletic performance has been well documented within the sport psychology literature. Athletes are constantly searching for methods of enhancing their performance, and mental imagery has been shown to improve the acquisition and execution of specific motor skills. Anxiety has also been studied closely because of its potential negative consequences on performance. The technique known as visuomotor behavior rehearsal (VMBR) was developed to reduce one's arousal level prior to engaging in mental imagery. Research has found this procedure to be an effective means of enhancing athletic performance in several sports. The present research attempts to advance the applicability of VMBR to batting performance of college baseball players. Sixty participants self-administered a VMBR technique over ten training sessions. Imagery ability was assessed and batting performance was measured to determine the effectiveness of VMBR in improving batting performance.

The most appreciated qualities in a sailor are his ability to access the weather variables, the conditions of the sea and the currents and his decision-making ability. Moreover the boat becomes a micro-society where an individual cannot ignore the others and the relationship cannot be super-ficial. Beside the authors examine the optimum psychological support especially for top level sailors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

The woman sought psychological counseling after a poor trampoline performance. The patient was evaluated using the Psychological Characteristics Related to Sports Performance Questionnaire (F. Gimeno et al, 1999), which evaluates stress management, motivation, mental ability, team cohesion, and the influence of performance evaluation on motivation and self-confidence. Details about the patient's objectives in seeking psychological help and specific components of her treatment and goal-setting program are described, including training in concentration and attention, control of negative emotions, self-regulation of activation level, preparation for competition, and objective analysis of competition. The effectiveness of psychological training methods and the importance of acquiring psychological skills that permit an adequate approach to training and competition are discussed.

AB - Although this is a chapter about the use of imagery in practice, for imagery techniques to be applied effectively it is important to appreciate the underlying theory and research. Because there is no corresponding theoretical chapter on imagery in part 1 of this book, in the first part of the chapter the authors briefly reflect on major aspects of theory and research as a background to the discussion of practice. Theoretical issues can only be summarized. For additional information, there are several recent review chapters on imagery in sport, but to address in detail all aspects of imagery applied to sport requires a book. More attention will be paid to several issues that have a direct bearing on the use of imagery. The authors first consider definitions of imagery then review theories proposed to explain how imagery works. They discuss the measurement of imagery then summaries the research on imagery. The chapter then moves on to consider the application of imagery, including discussion of common uses of imagery, how it can be introduced to athletes and how it can be effectively integrated into competition to enhance performance. The authors provide examples of the application of imagery, then they consider the use of technical aids to facilitate imagery. Finally, the chapter reflects on future directions in imagery research and practice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)

AB - Athletes with disabilities often have to contend with unique social, psychological and physical issues. Because of these issues, psychological skills training programs designed for able-bodied athletes may or may not be ideal for athletes with disabilities. In the 1980s and early 1990s most publications in the area of sport psychology and athletes with disabilities focused on descriptive profiles and the reliability of assessment tools. Now there is research on mental skills training programs, as well as a range of applied articles aimed at coaches and athletes. This chapter presents observations and findings regarding athletes with disabilities and arousal control, body awareness, imagery, goal setting, self-confidence and pre-competition preparation. Issues related to communication and the educational process for specific types of disabilities are also included. In addition, general considerations on working with athletes with disabilities has been provided. The chapter finishes with a list of suggestions for future research.

AB - D. L. Wann (2002) proposed the team identification-psychological health model, hypothesizing that identification with a local sport team will be related to psychological well-being. The model also proposes that identification with distant sport teams and mere fandom will not be related to well-being. In a study involving Australian Rules Football, the authors extended previous research by testing the model with persons from a different culture and examining identifications involving a different sport and level of competition. Participants completed a questionnaire packet assessing their levels of fandom. identification with a local Australian Rules Football team, and identification with a favorite team if different from the target team, as well as measures assessing psychological well-being. With respect to social well-being, the results supported the model: Personal well-being was not related to identification.

AB - This article provides a framework that describes the aspects involved in designing quality web-based mental skills education (MSE) environments. The framework is grounded in the literature of web-based learning and sport psychology theory and practice. The core of the framework is the web-based educational environment. In order for web-based MSE to be effective, it should involve the athletes in environments that promote active learning. The following five characteristics of quality web-based MSE environments are outlined and discussed: (a) self-directing, (b) meaningful, (c) accommodating, (d) reflective, and (e) social. Careful consideration is also given to four elements suggested to facilitate the creation of a quality web-based MSE environment: (a) quality resources, (b) quality consulting approaches, (c) quality use of technology, and (d) quality service. This framework may provide some direction for mental skills educators beginning to explore web-based MSE and for researchers wanting to study the effectiveness of the web as a means for MSE.

Individual interviews were carried out with 10 climbers who have successfully reached the summit of Mount Everest. Common strategies of success were identified, as well as factors that created difficulty on the mountain. The themes of focus, mental toughness, short-term goals, drawing on past experience, connecting to one's body, feeling support from other climbers, and belief in personal capacities were seen to have importance in overcoming adversity on the mountain. These results support mental training as an effective tool for overcoming obstacles in the high stress environment of high altitude climbing.

AB - This experiment was designed to test the effect of performance feedback on the psychological state that follows an acute bout of maximal aerobic exercise. Forty competitive athletes were recruited and asked to perform a graded, maximal exercise test. Performance feedback was manipulated in the first two minutes following exercise to produce 4 conditions: (1) high performance, (2) low performance, (3) accurate feedback, and (4) no exercise control. Negative and positive psychological states were assessed prior to and at 10, 25 and 40 min post exercise. Results indicated that performance feedback moderated indicators of both positive and negative psychological states immediately after exercise. At 10 min post exercise, low performance feedback participants reported low positive states and high negative states. Although the differences in positive states remained throughout recovery, the differences in negative states were short lived. Groups did not differ in negative states 40 min following exercise. Results are discussed with regard to the mastery hypothesis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

This study tested this relationship from the perspective of objectification theory (Fredrickson & Roberts, 1997) by surveying and experimenting with 426 adolescent females aged 10-19. Sports magazine reading predicted greater body satisfaction among older adolescents, regardless of whether they participated in sports. Self-objectification in adolescents of all ages predicted mental health risks including body shame, disordered eating, and depression. Participants also viewed a video depicting men's sports, women's lean sports, or women's nonlean sports. For White participants, watching lean sports increased self-objectification, whereas for participants of color, watching nonlean sports had the same effect. Discussion focuses on self-objectification in adolescents and how cultural differences in the female body ideal are reflected in portrayals of female athletes.

AB - Using the theoretical framework of the Integrated Model of Psychological Response to the Sport Injury and Rehabilitation Process (Wiese-Bjornstal, Smith, Shaffer, & Morrey, 1998), the purpose of this study was to determine the type and nature of coping strategies employed by injured collegiate athletes in relation to a variety of injury characteristics, psychological factors, and social influences. Participants comprising this study were one hundred and twenty-eight male (n = 56) and female (n = 72) intercollegiate athletes who had incurred an injury, competing in one of sixteen intercollegiate sports at six different NCAA Division I and Division II universities. Athletes completed a set of questionnaires measuring demographic and injury related information, athletic identity, depression and anxiety levels, postinjury relations with coaches and teammates, satisfaction with social support, instrumental coping, emotional preoccupation coping, and palliative coping strategies. Results demonstrated that instrumental coping was the most frequently used coping strategy by injured collegiate athletes. No significant differences were found on the coping strategies relied upon by the participants according to gender, athletic division status, and scholarship status. Discriminant function analyses identified a number of injury, psychological, and social characteristics that were predictive of athletes' levels of reliance on each of the three types of coping strategies (high, moderate, and low usage of emotional preoccupation coping, palliative coping, and instrumental coping). A cluster analysis was performed and revealed three unique subgroups of injured athletes who demonstrated similar patterns of injury characteristics, psychological and social influences, and coping strategy use. In general, the analyses highlighted the importance of athletic identity, social support, goal endangerment, and affective responses (depression and anxiety) to injured athletes' coping responses. This study provided support for the Integrated Model of Psychological Response to the Sport Injury and Rehabilitation Process as a useful theoretical framework in relation to understanding injured athletes' psychological, emotional, and behavioral responses to athletic injury. The findings of this study have several practical implications for structuring effective interventions with injured athletes. Future research needs to continue to investigate the influence of psychological, social, and injury characteristics in relation to the coping strategies of injured athletes.

Mental toughness was assessed using Psychological Performance Inventory and Hardiness on the Personal Views Survey III-R. Participants (N = 70; 18-35 yrs old)) were international rugby league footballers representing 4 teams (Wales, France, Ireland, and England) in the 2000 Rugby League World Cup. Participants completed the questionnaires in training camp. Welsh-nationality players had a significantly higher mean score on 2 of the hardiness subscales. Hardiness measures displayed the greatest and most frequently statistically significant differences. The findings concur with previous work indicating superior hardiness is related to improved performance in sports. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Assessed the moderating effect of environment on attentional and emotional restoration during a run. The authors conducted a field experiment with environment (park, urban), occasion (first run, second run), and time (pre-run, post-run) as within-subjects factors, and gender as a between-subjects factor. 12 regular runners (6 males and 6 females; aged 26-46 yrs) provided self-reports of emotions and behavioral measures of attention before and after each of 2 1-hr runs in each of the 2 environments. The routes differed in amount of greenery, proximity to water, and presence of traffic, buildings, and other people. The authors also obtained background measures of stress and evaluations of the running environments. Characteristic of restoration, running reduced anxiety/depression and anger. It had inconsistent effects on attention. No Time × Environment interactions reached statistical significance. However, those for tranquility and anxiety/depression had medium-sized effects. The runners preferred the park over the urban environment and perceived it as more psychologically restorative. The study provides a point of departure for further research on potential moderating effects of outdoor environments on the psychological benefits of exercise.

AB - This article reports findings of a study to examine the effects of leisure coping on various stress coping outcomes including: immediate outcomes (perceived coping effectiveness, perceived satisfaction with coping outcomes, and perceived stress reduction) and distal or long-term outcomes (physical and mental ill-health and psychological well-being), above and beyond the contributions of general coping-- coping not directly associated with leisure. A repeated-assessment field design was used to examine ways in which university students cope with stressors in their daily lives. The study (N = 85 undergraduate students) found that leisure coping beliefs (leisure-generated dispositional coping resources) significantly predicted lower levels of mental and physical ill-health and greater levels of psychological well-being above and beyond the effects of general coping. Also, the use of leisure coping strategies (situation-specific stress coping strategies through leisure) was significantly associated with higher levels of perceived coping effectiveness and stress reduction when the effects of general coping were taken into account. Significant contributions of specific leisure coping dimensions were found as well. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Considerable research in the field of applied sport psychology has focused on the application of specific techniques to enhance performance. However very little investigation has occurred about the consultation process. This dissertation was conducted for the purpose of expanding the literature in sport psychology consultation. The author employed a case study design that involved the utilization of Maher's program planning and evaluation approach with a group of 13 male and female collegiate tennis players. These athletes competed in NCAA Division III athletics. The program planning and evaluation approach is defined by four phases: clarification, design, implementation, and evaluation. Using this approach, the consultant identified the client and relevant stakeholders as well as assessed the performance-based needs of the players and coaches. These individuals' needs were considered within a larger organizational context. Information from this needs and context assessment was used to design and implement three programs for these tennis players-workshops, individualized plans, and on-court consultations. Then, at the end of the season, the consultation services were evaluated using questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. Results of this evaluation indicated that the coaches and their players were satisfied with the consultation services. These findings suggest that the program planning and evaluation approach can be successfully applied within an athletic context as a framework for sport psychology consultation. Consequently, implications of this study for the fields of applied sport psychology and professional psychology are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - A major contribution in psychological research and practice during the last century was the development of scientifically based diagnostic standards. As a consequence of this development psychological diagnostic instruments, which share adequate reliability, validity, and functionality were established. The articles in this issue elaborate on essential diagnostic issues in sport and exercise psychology, and introduce diagnostic methods that are aimed at shedding more light on the issues of concern and interest. Furthermore, they rely on sound theories, which guide the methodology of diagnosis, but at the same time, emphasize the practical questions, which guide the practitioner in his/her everyday encounters with athletes, exercisers, and their instructors. The current issue is aimed at presenting the recent developments in various areas of sport psychology, namely, high-performance sport, exercise psychology, psychometric issues, and alternative forms of diagnosis.

AB - This conceptual analytic paper critically evaluates three approaches developed to enhance athletic performance: anxiety management, imagery, and self-talk. Each psychological intervention was systematically evaluated, followed by critical analysis of how each intervention has been applied. Suggestions are made to help researchers incorporate more variables into each intervention and in the process help render the interventions more inclusive in their application. While, in general, anxiety management, imagery, and self-talk strategies have been shown to augment athletic performance, there are a number of limitations in the application of these interventions. For example, little is known regarding the psychobiological mechanisms underlying post treatment behavioral change. In addition, these athletic enhancement methods remain at an early stage of development with outcome studies being limited by the lack of adequate experimental controls (e.g., quantifying the separate influence of the various components of each intervention strategy) and by the large sample size (the author of this dissertation will show how using small sample sizes will help reduce the equivocal results of research on sports). Additionally, important variables that likely influence athletic performance (e.g., motivation, limiting physiological factors, degree of self-esteem, extent of public exposure) are typically not included in outcome research. Finally, practitioners have applied these interventions to solve global problems (e.g., general performance anxiety) rather than tailoring these approaches for individual purposes (e.g., some athletes may benefit from moderate pregame nervousness). A number of specific recommendations to improve athletic performance are made. It is argued that idiographic measurements of athletic performance be included in sports psychology research to better illuminate the mechanisms by which athletic performance interventions improve the physical execution of skilled motor behaviors. The goal of this work is to be helpful to sports psychologists and athletes as they seek ways to improve athletic performance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - The field of sport psychology has expert performance consultants, but like Statler (2001) pointed out, little has been done to tap into their wealth of knowledge. In fact, most of the research in applied sport psychology has examined the effectiveness of techniques and interventions used in service delivery (e.g., Greenspan & Feltz, 1989; Strean & Roberts, 1992; Vealey, 1988, 1994), behavior, training, and the ethics of sport psychology consultants (e.g., Partington & Orlick, 1991; Sachs, 1993). Relatively little attention has been given to the actual experiences of expert consultants practicing in the field. The goal of this study was to put forth a rich description of expert sport psychology consultants' experience of providing sport psychology consultation to athletes. To obtain a meaningful description of the phenomenon, an existential-phenomenological dialogue was used. The phenomenological interview utilizes a single question directing the co-participant to describe his or her experience. All subsequent questions stem from the discussion started by this one original question. Eleven expert sport psychology consultants were interviewed and asked to describe their experience of providing sport psychology consultation to athletes. After the interviews were completed, the data were transcribed and analyzed using three hermeneutic approaches: group interpretation, idiographic interpretation, and nomothetic interpretation. The results revealed six themes that seemed to characterize these consultants' experience of providing sport psychology consultation to athletes: (1) Enjoyment, (2) Learning, (3) Challenges, (4) Collaboration, (5) Knowledge, and (6) Relationship. The present findings support and broaden previous research suggesting that the interaction of certain techniques, interventions, and characteristics along with certain elements of an individual consultant's style, application, and experience comprise expert performance consultation. The paper concludes with implications and recommendations for athletes, coaches, sport psychology consultants, and researchers in sport psychology as well as researchers interested in phenomenological methodology.

AB - An evaluation was done of 25 golf instruction books to determine the extent to which they incorporated the performance enhancement elements of: (1) Recognition and formulation of goals; (2) Mental and physical relaxation; (3) Positive affirmation and reinforcement; (4) Visualization of preparation and reinforcement; and (5) "Letting go". It was found that there were a few books written by individuals versed in the teaching of golf which incorporated performance enhancement principles. Most of these are contemporary works although at least one book incorporating a substantial amount of the basic principles was published in 1946. This was long before the subject was widely discussed in books and articles. On the other hand, books written by the "big name" tournament golf players incorporated almost no performance enhancement material. Books expounding new or novel theories regarding the playing of golf varied widely in the amount of performance enhancement material used. Books on the biomechanics of the golf swing barely mentioned performance enhancement. Of the books intended for teachers of golf, only the newest included an appreciable amount of material on performance enhancement. While the study provided no firm evidence regarding the efficacy of performance enhancement methods as applied to golf, there was evidence from the literature that their teaching could be an important supplement to traditional instruction. It was concluded that the golf teaching "pro" of the future will be a true professional, versed in performance enhancement principles as well as having an understanding of golf's biomechanics, and with well-developed teaching skills.

AB - This review identifies key psychological characteristics associated with athletic excellence; presents a pyramid model of peak performance that summarizes current psychology of excellence research; and discusses a current psychology of excellence research project that focuses on how psychological talent is developed in Olympic champions. The author's studies focusing on how mental preparation and cognitive strategies influence athletic and motor performance, general psychological characteristics associated with athletic success, and anxiety and coping in elite athletes are discussed and factors influencing peak performance identified. Hardy, Jones, and Gould's (1996) pyramid model of peak performance that organizes specific peak performance factors into a coherent whole is then presented. The author and his colleagues' current research that identifies the psychological characteristics of 10 of the United States most successful Olympians is discussed. This study identifies strategies that these athletes, their coaches, and families identified as influencing their mental development. It is concluded that two decades of psychology of athletic excellence research forms a strong base for guiding professional practice and stimulating future research.

AB - This study examined sport participation (excluding physical education classes) of Chinese children and adolescents with disabilities attending special schools in Hong Kong. A sample of 237 youth, aged 9-19 yrs, and encompassing children with physical disability, visual impairment, hearing impairment, mild mental disability, or maladjustment, responded to a sport participation questionnaire in individual interviews. Data were analyzed by gender, school level (primary vs secondary), and the 5 disability types. Results relating to participation frequency and extent indicates that girls were significantly less active than boys. Youth with physical disability, visual impairment, and mental disability were less active than those with hearing impairment and maladjustment. Children with different types of disabilities varied in their participation patterns and choices of physical activities as well as their motives for sport participation, nonparticipation, and withdrawal. It is concluded that disability type is more related to children's participation behaviors in sport and physical activities than to gender and school level.

Ten international performers participated in either a focus group or one-to-one interviews, from which a definition of mental toughness and the attributes of the ideal mentally tough performer emerged. The resulting definition emphasized both general and specific dimensions, while the 12 attributes covered self-belief, desire/motivation, dealing with pressure and anxiety, focus (performance-related), focus (lifestyle-related), and pain/hardship factors. Results are discussed in context of existing literature on mental toughness. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - The primary purpose of this paper was to investigate the concept of "repeatable good performance" in professional cricketers. The manuscript reports the findings and triangulation of 3 separate studies using different subjects (Ss) within the same population. Ss' responses were subjected to either an inductive content analysis (study 1), the repertory grid technique (study 2), or a cultural consensus analysis (study 3) as means of data analyses. The triangulation of results suggested that both batters and bowlers in cricket reported similar core element antecedents before repeatable good performance occurred. The core antecedents were confirmed as: Total self-confidence, optimal arousal levels, motivation and focus, and total mental preparation which included imagery, pre-match routines, and goal setting. These findings experimentally confirm the need for professional cricketers to use a repertoire of mental skills that have previously only been suggested via anecdotal evidence. Results may prove beneficial for cricketers, coaches, and sport psychology practitioners in their pursuit of consistent good performance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Although consulting with performers continues to be a foundational component within the field of applied sport psychology, the perceptions of exceptional consultants regarding what they do remains somewhat of a mystery. A wealth of research has been conducted evaluating the characteristics of effective sport psychology intervention programs, as well as characteristics of effective consultants, but little has been done to determine what, if anything, the truly outstanding consultants are doing differently in their work. The purpose of this study was to provide an in-depth description of what these individuals are doing in their consulting work that sets them apart. Open-ended, conversational interviews were conducted with 12 ( N = 12) exceptional applied sport psychology consultants scattered around North America. These individuals were chosen through a snowball sample of professionals in the field of sport psychology asked simply to identify who they felt were the best applied consultants. Once this list of exceptional consultants had been generated, nominations were rank ordered, with the top 12 included in the interview phase. Interviews were inductively content analyzed with data formulated from 532 individual meaning units into progressively higher order and common themes. From this analysis, six major categories emerged: (a) sense of self, in which the participants discussed their perceptions of who they are and the personality characteristics that contribute to their sense of identity; (b) athlete-centered approach to consulting, which addressed how their underlying epistemology and use of counseling skills contribute to an effective counseling environment; (c) experience, which examined the critical components of personal and professional evolution along the path to expertise; (d) sense of fulfillment, in which the participants discussed elements that both contribute and detract from their career satisfaction; (e) external support, the category identifying how others contribute to the consultant's ability; and finally, (f) elusive factors, where the participants addressed the notion that in addition to all the previously identified elements contributing to their expertise, there are still other components involved that were much more difficult to conceptualize. From this analysis, it would seem that several common themes are prevalent in the creation of an outstanding applied sport psychology consultant. Yet, a closer examination of the data indicates that although all of these consultants are deemed outstanding, each arrives at this designation in his or her own unique way. This phenomenon is interpreted and several recommendations for further study are provided. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - 44 Japanese women recreational tennis players (aged 28-58 yrs) acted as the main sample of volunteer participants in this reversal theory-based study of changes in emotion and stress induced by a single session of leisure activity. Based on their primary reason for playing tennis (e.g., health, exercise, weight control, vs fun, challenge), participants were divided into "serious" (telic) and "hedonistic" (paratelic) leisure groups respectively. Participants completed the Tension and Effort Stress Inventory, 5 min before and within 5 min after playing tennis. Although no significant inter-group differences were found, a number of significant pre- to post-session intra-group changes were revealed following statistical analysis. For the serious group, a decrease in overall unpleasant emotions was significant, as were decreases in external tension stress. A significant decrease in external tension stress was also obtained for the hedonistic group. For individual emotions, a number of statistically significant results were also revealed. Taken together, the results indicated that, especially for the serious group, tennis activities had a therapeutic effect, producing an improvement in overall affect.

AB - The goal of the contribution is to draw attention to exercises of movement, sports and their therapeutic potential. With this respect, results of classical researches are described in the light of positivism in the therapy of mental diseases (affective disorders; neurotic, stress-conditioned, somatoformed disorders, etc.). However, the basic part of the contribution is dedicated to newer trends focused on the process of motional and sports activity and the therapeutic potential hidden in particular forms of exercises. This permits hermeneutic and phenomenological approach to sports and emphasis on sports experience. A properly chosen sport with subsequent elaboration of the sport experience in a psychotherapeutic session can be a valuable, supportive factor within the scope of therapy of some mental diseases, but mostly already in the phase of their prevention and in stimulation of mental development of the young human being.

AB - This chapter proposes that the consulting psychologist could find a valuable resource in the methodologies used to enhance the performance of high-level athletes. It examines the possible beneficial outcomes resulting from the integration of sport psychology performance-enhancement principles, also known as mental training, into organizational consultation, particularly for individuals. Sport psychologists have identified 5 major skills of mental training. These are: (1) the incorporation of mental imagery into the planning for the season, injury recovery, and competition preparation; (2) the use of performance routines in training and competition; (3) the use of positive self-talk to mentally guide performance; (4) activation control strategies; and (5) techniques for sharpening focus and sustaining attention to a task (concentration). Recommendations for training teams and entire organizations are also noted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)

AB - Few mental processes seem to be reported as ubiquitously by athletes as imagery. Athletes of all levels commonly talk of "feeling the shot" and "seeing the shot" before they perform. Sport psychologists have naturally focused a great deal of research attention on the use of imagery in sport. Much of this research has focused heavily on the use of imagery to mentally practice sports skills. although this is an important research topic, it only addresses one use of imagery in sport. Athletes use imagery for a variety of purposes other than mental practice. In addition, mental practice research has done little to advance our understanding of the cognitive processes that underlie imagery use. In this chapter we propose a three-level model of analysis to guide imagery research and practice in sport. This model addresses the fundamental nature of imagery, the uses of imagery in sport settings, and the meaning of the imagery experience for athletes.

AB - Involvement in physical activity and sports in the senior population has been shown within the literature to provide these athletes with improved health status and psychological benefits (McPherson, 1984). To date, few studies have examined psychological factors, such as motivation and psychological skills, in relation to senior athletes' participation in competitive sports. The sport psychology literature does include the measurement of the constructs of motivation and psychological skills via the use of the Athletic Coping Skills Inventory - 28 (ACSI-28) (Smith, Schultz, Smoll, & Ptacek, 1995) and the Sport Motivation Scale (SMS) (Pelletier, Fortier, Vallerand, Tuson, Briere, & Blais, 1995) within the collegiate and professional athletic arena. While these instruments have been shown to be reliable and valid in measuring psychological skills and type of motivation in younger populations, it was not known whether these instruments would be accurate in assessing these same constructs within the senior athletic population. Therefore, the general purpose of this two phase investigation was to evaluate the psychometric properties of both the ACSI-28 and the SMS in assessing psychological skills and motivation in independent samples of senior athletes competing in the West Virginia Senior Sports Classic held from June 15-18, 2000 in Charleston, West Virginia and the Florida Senior State Championships held in Kissimmee, FL from November 28-December 3, 2000. Results of the data analyses revealed significant differences across age groups for amotivation as well as differences in psychological skills across gender and qualification status. Results of psychometric testing on the ACSI-28 and the SMS did not support the construct validity of these instruments in assessing psychological skills and motivational type in the senior athletic population. Information gleaned from this study serves as a baseline for future studies, which can build upon examining the constructs of motivation and psychological skill among senior athletes. Information may be used to educate future senior game participants who compete on a variety of levels on how to incorporate psychological skill, recognize and improve motivational strategies, in order to increase the likelihood of achieving successful performances.

AB - The current study examined the impact that psychological factors have on the performance of the NCAA Division I Golfer. The study also sought to determine if there were sex differences in the psychological factors affecting performance. There were 110 golfers, 66 males and 44 females, who participated in the study. All golfers were administered a 65 item self-report questionnaire titled the Golf Performance Survey. The nine subscales of the Golf Performance Survey (Negative Emotions and Cognitions, Mental Preparation, Conservative Approach, Concentration, Striving for Maximum Distance, Automaticity, Putting Skill, Seeking Improvement, and Commitment) as well as sex of the golfer were the independent variables in the study. The golfers also provided their end of season average scoring statistic (ESAS) as a measure of performance. ESAS was the dependent variable in the current research. It was hypothesized that those players who had better developed psychological skills would have a lower ESAS. Results were indicative of sex differences and found that multiple psychological factors impacted performance. Specifically, males performed better than females and provided significantly different ratings than females on two subscales. Commitment and Seeking Improvement were able to predict group membership because males reported more commitment and a stronger desire to seek improvement than females. Simple correlations and stepwise multiple regression were used to determine the relationship between the psychological factors and ESAS. Results suggested that when all subjects were included in the analysis, Commitment, Negative Emotions and Cognitions, and Putting Skill were able to account for approximately 18.3% of the variance in a golfer's performance. When males were the only subjects included in the regression equation, Automaticity and Conservative Approach accounted for 34.5% of the variance in male golfer performance. When females were the only subjects included in the regression equation, Negative Emotions and Cognitions accounted for 15.8% of the variance in female golfer performance.

AB - The present study examined the interaction of traditional and electronic contact methods with the stages of change model in a brief intervention. The sample consisted of a total of 220 high school (n = 106) and college athletes (n = 114), including 115 in the Electronic Group (E group) and 105 in the Traditional Group (T group). Overall, 14 teams participated in a sport psychology workshop including seven women's teams (n = 124) and seven men's teams (n = 96). Teams were randomly assigned to contact the sport psychology consultant (SPQ either by traditional methods (in-person or phone) or by electronic methods (email or webpage) after the workshop. It was hypothesized that there would be greater amounts of both overall contact and assessments completed in the E group when compared to the T group in the one-month period following the workshop. Modest support for this hypothesis was achieved although low contact rates, particularly in the traditional group limited the power of the analyses. Results provided strong support for the hypothesis that athletes prefer electronic methods to traditional methods for both contacting a SPC and for gathering sport psychology information. Moderate effect sizes ( d = .50-.95) generally supported the positive impact of the workshop on perceptions of mental training and in inducing positive cognitive shifts. The interaction between athletes using electronic and traditional services for follow-up contact was assessed as well. The interaction was only supported in a couple situations, yet the low contact rates across the entire sample may have negatively affected these analyses. Although the effect sizes were small to moderate for most of the analyses, the study provides a first step in a growing area of service utilization within psychology. Overall results suggest that electronic contact methods are at least equal to, and in several cases superior to, traditional contact methods regarding generating interest and requests for service from athletes. The main practical implications for sport psychology consultants are addressed and the future directions for transtheoretical and alternative media research in applied sport psychology are explored.

AB - To gain a better understanding of factors perceived to have positively and/or negatively influenced Olympic athlete performance and to examine differences in performance factors cited by athletes who met or exceeded performance expectations and athletes who failed to meet expectations, 8 Atlanta and 7 Nagano Olympians (11 females and 4 males, aged 23-44 yrs) were interviewed. Interviews were conducted via telephone, tape recorded, transcribed, and content analyzed by three investigators. Major factors perceived to have positively influenced performance included mental skills and preparation, attitude towards the Olympics, support services and support facilitation, multifaceted preparation, physical preparation, and coaching. Major factors perceived to have negatively influenced performance included departing from normal routine, media distractions, coach issues, overtraining, and injury. The two groups, those who met or exceeded expectations and those who did not meet expectations, differed on only a few positive performance factors, including attitude towards the games, Olympic housing, and team unity. Negative factors that differed between the groups included team selection, coaching, lack of support, and team issues. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - The present study examined the effects of a mental skills training package on gymnasium triathlon performance. Five male participants (aged 20–32 years) took part in a single-subject multiple baseline across individuals design, which was used to evaluate an intervention package including goal setting, relaxation, imagery, and self-talk. The results of the study indicated the mental skills package to be effective in enhancing triathlon performance for all five participants. Additionally, all participants increased their usage of mental skills from baseline to intervention phases. Follow-up social validation checks indicated all participants to have perceived the intervention to be successful and enjoyable, and all were satisfied with delivery and content of the package. In conclusion, the findings provide further evidence to suggest mental skills training packages to be effective for endurance performance.

AB - The purpose of the study was to create a questionnaire to identify underlying dimensions of athletes' attitudes toward seeking sport psychology consultation. A total of 1138 athletes (625 males, 513 females) representing 36 sports from four levels of participation were used to develop the Sport Psychology Attitudes Questionnaire (SPAQ). In Study I, exploratory factor analysis produced a two-factor solution that accounted for 37.1% of the overall variance: (a) belief in the credibility of sport psychology (14 items) and (b) preference for similarity with a sport psychology consultant (SPC) (7 items). Three items were omitted following item analysis, and nine items were eliminated after failing to load higher than the cut-off value of .40 on either of the factors. In Study II, confirmatory factor analysis supported the two-factor model, and multigroup comparison in Study III demonstrated that the model fit well for both male and female samples. As for validity, the SPAQ factors predictably (a) distinguished between athletes with and without previous experience with a SPC, (b) related to ratings of helpfulness/satisfaction related to a previous experience with a SPC, and (c) correlated with willingness to see a SPC for help in the future. Also, the SPAQ factors were related, as predicted, to (a) belief that practicing sport psychology skills will lead to desirable outcomes, (b) interpersonal openness, and (c) affective prejudice toward identified outgroups but were not related to level of self-concept as hypothesized. Contrary to predictions, Gender X Race X SPC experience MANOVAs revealed no gender or racial differences in attitudes toward sport psychology consultation. It was concluded that the SPAQ is a valid and reliable instrument for assessing a set of important attitudinal dimensions with regard to seeking sport psychology consultation and a useful instrument for research and practice. Theoretical and empirical support for the interpretation of the SPAQ factor structure, directions for future research, and practical implications are discussed.

AB - Presents a case study of a 27-yr-old male who is considered the most prolific rugby goal kicker of all time. In the first part of the study, the consistency of his preperformance routine was analyzed over kicks of varying difficulty. The results indicate that while certain physical aspects of his routine remain consistent, both his concentration time and physical preparation time increase with kick difficulty. In the second part of the study, the participant was interviewed about his physical and mental preparation for rugby goal kicking in competitive situations. The interview reveals that the participant incorporates a number of psychological skills into his routine, including thought stopping, cueing, and imagery but does not do so consistently. However, he perceives the timing of his routine to be highly consistent. Implications of these findings for the recommendation that performers strive for temporal consistency in their routines are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Studied the effect of group sports training with cognitive therapy on the mental health status of college students. 62 college students (33 males and 29 females) (mean age: 19.8 yrs) with mild depression (Ss' scores of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were higher than 13) in Fuyang Normal University, China, were randomly divided into 2 groups. Group A (31 Ss) received the group counseling first and Group B (31 Ss) received counseling later. The study was designed to compare Group A Ss' BDI scores after the training and counseling with Group B Ss' BDI scores before the training and counseling and to compare Group B Ss' BDI scores before and after the training and counseling. The sports training included 5 sessions: games of language and movement, cognitive therapy (reasoning–emotional therapy), training with lower heart rate sports exercises, group discussion, and conclusion. Ss evaluated themselves in each session. The results show that Ss' scores of the BDI were significantly lower after the training. It is concluded that sports training with cognitive therapy is effective to improve college students' mental health status. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - The purposes of this dissertation were to assess and analyze the sources and levels of self-confidence of senior adult (aging) athletes. Secondly, the author of this dissertation also examined the influence of gender and sport participation levels (senior adults, college, high school) within a single sport on the perceived importance of various sources of sport-confidence. This dissertation was conducted utilizing the sources of sport-confidence framework (Vealey, Hayashi, Garner-Holman, & Giacobbi, 1998), which included the nine-factored sources of the sport-confidence model, and athletic characteristics and organizational cultures as influences of sources of confidence in one's sport. The results did not replicate the nine sources of sport-confidence contained in the factor structure of the Sources of Sport-Confidence Questionnaire (SSCQ) with samples of senior adult, college and high school athletes. The results revealed that a modified six-factor model (SSCQ-M) was needed to explain the sources of sport-confidence, as well as its factor structure cross-sectionally. The regression analysis indicated that physical/mental preparation was the best predictor of sport-confidence of senior adult, college, and high school athletes. Multivariate and univariate analyses of variances, and Tukey's Post-Hoc analysis, also found that the perceived importance of various sources of sport-confidence differed between and within gender, and between participation levels in the sport of track and field. The six-factor model appeared to be stable across gender and sport-participation levels and supported Atchley's (1989) continuity theory of aging.

AB - The present study examined the importance of four psychological constructs, self-efficacy, cognitive interference, sport anxiety, and psychological coping skills, in predicting the performance of 117 men and 79 women intercollegiate golfers in the Pacific-10 Athletic Conference. Prior to the start of the 1997 spring intercollegiate golf season, members of all men's and women's teams in the conference completed a questionnaire which included trait measures of self-efficacy, sport anxiety, athletic coping skills, and social desirability. The coaches at each of these schools rated each of their players' psychological and physical abilities as well using separate rating instruments. At the men's and women's Pac-10 Conference Championships, additional state measures of self-efficacy and cognitive interference were gathered. Outcome measures included the participant's spring tournament stroke average and number of competitive rounds completed. In addition, total score, total birdies (one under par on a hole) or better, and total double-bogeys (two over par on a hole) or worse were calculated for the 60 men and 50 women who participated in the Pac-10 Tournament. Results revealed that each of main psychological factors was significantly correlated with golf performance for men and women. Furthermore, when social desirability ratings were partialed out, correlations of psychological factors with performance were almost universally strengthened. Several of the measures maintained significant correlations with performance even after a measure of physical ability was statistically controlled. Discriminant function analyses revealed that each of the measures was also effective at discriminating the men who participated in the Pac-10 Tournament from those who didn't but similar analyses for the women were not significant. Structural equation modeling provided tentative support for the causal influence of these psychological factors on performance. The implications of this study for future research are discussed.

AB - This study was conducted to investigate the knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of selected Trinidad and Tobago coaches and athletes regarding sport psychology consultation. Additionally, gender differences were examined in regard to the variables under study. Three questionnaires were distributed to 357 coaches and athletes 18 years of age or older. The sample was drawn from the following six major sports identified by the Trinidad and Tobago Olympic Committee (TTOC): cycling, field hockey, football (soccer), netball, rifle, and rugby. Participants were asked to complete three questionnaires: the Ottley Demographic Questionnaire (ODQ), the Sullivan and Hodge (1991) Coaches and Athletes Survey (SHCAS), and the Sport Psychology Attitudes - Revised Form (SPA-R). It was hypothesized that there were no statistically significant differences on scores of knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions regarding sport psychology consultation in Trinidad and Tobago. Additionally, demographic differences were investigated between the study sample and the population statistics to Trinidad and Tobago. The results of the study showed an overall need for knowledge based and culturally sensitive developmental programs in sport psychology. Coaches reported to have attended more sport psychology clinics than athletes, 48 and 28.6% respectively. Despite coaches' and athletes' limited knowledge of sport psychology coaches' knowledge scores were generally higher than athletes' scores. Both males and females held similar belief that knowledge development and quality sport psychology services were important to the improvement of their sport performance Coaches and athletes (70%) found that their psychological needs were not being met and were interested in working with a sport psychologist. There was a perception among sport groups that sport psychology services would contribute to the improvement of their sport performance. Despite some of the cultural issues, which may affect coaches' and athletes' comfort in dealing with a sport psychologist, there was an overwhelming belief that sport psychology services would contribute to the improvement of their sport performance. Differences were found between study sample and the population of Trinidad and Tobago in terms of race, education level, and gender. Racial differences among sport participants may be intertwined with the historical legacy of colonialism. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Women's World Cup is one of the most significant events for girls and women in sports this century. The importance of mental skills for athletic success is certainly not new. Coaches and participants in every sport extol the importance of the four pillars of sport essential to competitive excellence—technical (requisite skills of a sport), tactical (strategies used), physiological (physical requirements), and psychological (mental skills). Most, however, focus almost exclusively on the first three dimensions. At its core, sport psychology addresses the psychological factors that influence performance in sport and the effects of that participation on the individual. Psychological skills mirror physical training parameters, As psychological skills are developed and refined with consistent, qualified, and systematic training, the benefits accruing from such training increase over the years. Although a majority of the members of the 1999 women's soccer team have been in psychological skills training for 4 or more years, several are early in their skills training development. Psychological skills training includes relaxation techniques, imagery, concentration and distraction control strategies, prepractice and precompetition preparation, positive self-talk and performance cues, goal setting, and team building. No counseling occurs from a clinical standpoint. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - Objectives: The purpose of the present study was to explore psychological performance crises under time pressure towards the end of basketball games. Three hypotheses were tested: (a) situations in the end phase of the game would be evaluated as highly critical; (b) crisis probability will increase within the end phase of the game, from its beginning towards its end; (c) players' decision behaviour would be of lesser quality under high- versus low-criticality situations. Design and Methods: A panel of six experts observed elite basketball players at the end phase of 10 close games at the highest international level. In the study's first stage, three experts evaluated the criticality of each possession during the observed game intervals. In the second stage of the study, three experts' evaluations of team- and player-decision making behaviour in offense, defense and scoring attempts were analyzed. Results: In the study's first stage, experts' judgments indicated that the final phase of the game was characterized as comprising twice as many highly critical possessions than low-criticality possessions. In addition, the number of highly critical possessions grew dramatically towards the end of the phase. In the study's second stage, results indicated that highly critical possessions were characterized by a lower quality of decision making compared to low criticality possessions. Conclusions: Results in both stages supported all three hypotheses, in accordance with crisis theory. It is recommended that researchers further observe athletes' decision behaviour within the framework of crisis theory, and practitioners are advised to direct athletes' mental preparation towards the end phases of games.

The study sample of 20 was selected from the students of the track and field games course/level (1). The researcher applied the experimental method of the experimental design for two experimental groups (1) and (2). Analogy was established between the members of the two groups in age, height and weight and the efficiency tests for the short distance runners. The study results indicated that the 1st group subjects who practiced the physical, skill and mental training program were superior to the 2nd experimental group subjects who practiced the physical and skill training program in all efficiency tests except for running (30 m) from the standing position. The researcher recommended the approval of the mental training program in addition to the physical and skill training due to its benefit in improving and developing the achievement level in short distance running.

Evidence exists, however, to support the view that positive outcomes such as increased social competence and improved physical fitness result from participation in Special Olympics and adapted physical activity programs for individuals identified as mentally retarded as compared to their non-athletic peers (Gibbons & Bushakra, 1989; Wright & Cowden, 1986; Zoerink & Wilson, 1995). Based on these findings, it seems reasonable to conclude that the opportunity to pursue achievement in the physical domain serves to benefit individuals identified as being cognitively deficient. This opportunity for engagement in particular achievement activities or domains may depend on the values and expectations of significant others, particularly parents (Eccles et al., 1983). The purposes of this study were (a) to examine the nature of parental expectations and values as they relate to the opportunities they provide for their children in the physical domain, and (b) to explore the attraction to physical activity and sport and perceived competence of children with moderate cognitive needs. Theoretically based parental and youth interviews were used to acquire information for inductive analyses on the nature of parental influence on their children's athletic endeavors, youth attraction to physical activity and sport, and youth perceived physical competence. The appropriateness of using quantitative measures with youth with moderate cognitive needs was also explored. Results from this study supported the use of a modified version of Eccles et al.'s (1983) expectancy-value model as an explanation for how parental expectations and values relate to the sport and physical activity socialization of youth with moderate cognitive needs. Parental sport and physical activity expectations, and the opportunities they provided in the physical domain, were found to be oriented towards the social development and facilitation of independence among their children. The sport and physical activity values identified by parents suggested that the physical domain was viewed as beneficial for their children's social, psychological, emotional, and physical development. An expanded conceptual basis for understanding youth attraction to physical activity and sport and perceived physical competence also emerged from these findings. Based on the wealth of knowledge established on the athletic experiences of youth with cognitive disabilities, continued research on the influence of parents in the physical domain and exploration of the sport and physical activity involvement among youth with moderate cognitive needs is encouraged.

AB - Presents theory regarding the Maladaptive Fatigue Syndrome (MFS) and addresses the role of emotion in its prevention and rehabilitation. The author gives a definition of MFS as being physical and/or mental fatigue caused by a combination of stressors from mental, physical and social sources. It is a multidimensional psychobiosocial state resulting in a withdrawal from a formerly enjoyable or motivating activity due to excessive fatigue. The causes of MFS, the emotions involved in adaptive and maladaptive fatigue, approaches to measurement of MFS, and strategies for its prevention are among issues addressed in this chapter.

AB - Examined if mental skills and strategies such as high confidence, commitment, and the use of cooperative routines, as well as previously unexamined physical, social, and environmental factors affect Olympic performance. Athletes and coaches from 8 US Olympic teams were interviewed. Four teams met/exceeded performance expectations and 4 teams failed to perform up to performance predictions. Focus group interviews were conducted with 2 to 4 athletes from each team. Individual interviews were conducted with 1 or 2 coaches from each team. Differences existed between teams that met/exceeded performance expectations and teams that failed. Teams that met/exceeded expectations participated in resident training programs, experienced crowd and family or friend support, used mental preparation, and were highly focused and committed. Teams that failed to meet expectations experienced planning and team cohesion problems, lacked experience, faced travel problems, experienced coaching problems, and encountered problems related to focus and commitment. Results showed that achievement of peak performance at the Olympic Games is a complex and delicate process influenced by a variety of psychological, physical, social, and organizational factors.

AB - This dissertation employed a case study format that focused on the application of a program planning and evaluation framework with a collegiate soccer team in applied sport psychology consultation. The purpose was to determine the extent which this framework would facilitate productive interaction between an external consultant, coaches, and team members as well as make the overall consultation worthwhile and appropriate to all concerned. The framework was used with a soccer team in a four year liberal arts college for women. The soccer team participated in the CACC conference, NAIA Northeast region. There were 18 players on the team. The program planning and evaluation process that is part of the framework consists of four phases: clarification, design, implementation, and evaluation. Through the clarification phase, a clear understanding of the present situation that was of concern to the people asking for consultation was obtained. This included identifying the client, relevant performance needs of the team members and coaches, and understanding the context in which those needs were embedded. The areas of need that were identified and believed to be relevant for a need assessment were categorized into cognitive domain, affective domain, socialization/communication domain, and education domain. Following the need assessment, a program was designed to address particular needs involving coaches and team members and was aimed at particular goals. Then, the program was implemented according to plan and finally the program was evaluated by answering specific program evaluation questions. The main methods used for the evaluation were consumer reaction and goal attainment ratings. The results of this evaluation indicated that the program was considered worthwhile in addressing identified needs while coaches and team members were satisfied with the overall consultation. The findings from this case study are then discussed, especially when it may be appropriate to apply the program planning and evaluation framework in sport psychology consultation and whether it may facilitate interaction between a consultant and athletes. Also, the relevance of the findings to applied sport psychology, professional psychology, and program planning and evaluation is addressed, along with particular limitations of this case study.

AB - While during adolescence self-esteem tends to decrease for females, it tends to stay the same or increase for boys. Because low self-esteem is a risk factor for a myriad of negative outcomes during adolescence, decreases in females' self-esteem warrant great concern and attention. A vast literature extols the numerous physical, psychological, cognitive, and other benefits to youth who participate in sports, including increased self-esteem and decreased depression and anxiety. Thus, sports are an optimal avenue to prevent decreases in girls' self-esteem. An innovative program in IL provides a diverse group of 10-12 year-old girls with a four-week sports camp experience designed to facilitate the development of self-esteem, leadership, and team building skills through active and healthy participation in sports and related education. The camp adheres to Social Cognitive Theory, which posits that in order to increase healthy behavior, an intervention needs to provide participants with information and knowledge, skills to translate knowledge into action, and opportunities to practice skills to increase confidence in performing them. Using a quasi-experimental quantitative research design, 61 campers and 49 matched, no-treatment control participants completed a pre- and post-test questionnaire comprised of a variety of scales to assess psychological well-being prior. Additionally, the campers completed a pre- and post-qualitative evaluation to assess their self-reported experiences at camp. It was expected that campers would show improvements relative to control participants in the following areas: self-esteem, depression, self-confidence, other (ethnic) group orientation, body image, and sports self-efficacy. A series of ANCOVAs, which controlled for pre-test scores, revealed a significant difference between the experimental and control participants on behavior conduct self-esteem (a measure of how one feels about one's behavior conduct), as well as a trend toward significance on depression. Additionally, on a series of one-way ANOVAs conducted on change scores from the pre- to the post-test, fitness evaluation (a body image measure of how fit one evaluates oneself to be) was found to be significant. Further, qualitative analyses revealed that campers overall enjoyed camp, learned a variety of sports and "life lessons," developed friendships, and improved how they feel about themselves.

AB - This study examined peak moments in sport karate tournament competition via interviews with black belt point fighters. The participants were 7 senior male black belts and 7 observers from St. Louis and Salt Lake City who were asked open-ended questions regarding peak moment experiences during tournament competition. Peak moments are an important area of sport psychology research. The purpose of this study was to provide an in-depth understanding of peak moments as experienced by senior black belt karate point fighters during tournament competition. A second purpose was to describe the influence of the peak experience on the participants. The objective was to provide evidence for peak moments in sport karate tournament competition. Eleven hundred thirty-seven "meaning units" (a word or sentence) from 14 in-depth, semistructured interviews provided the basis for the data analysis. The meaning units varied in length from a few words to sentences that comprised the raw data. The responses were clustered around underlying uniformities utilizing inductive content analysis. The participants' quotes were abstracted to 48 lower order themes. The lower order themes were clustered into 12 common higher order themes by which the experience was described for each athlete. These extensive higher order themes were the general characteristics of the overall experience. Data analysis revealed three distinct phases: (a) precompetition, (b) during competition, and (c) postcompetition in which the 12 common higher order themes were organized. Precompetition higher order themes included person-and-situation-unique experiences, application of mental skills training, confidence as positive expectancy, and sport skill mastery. During-competition themes included transition into peak moments, altered state experience, transition out of peak moments, mental skills applications, and confidence as feelings of power. Postcompetition themes included reflections on experience, mental skills growth, and confidence growth. In addition, serendipitous findings emerged from the data and were described for each participant. Results confirmed empirical evidence about peak moments in sport and revealed other factors involved in peak moments in sport karate tournament competition. Peak moments in sport karate are a dynamic, continuous process that requires confidence with transitions and growth into future peak moments.

AB - Although it is generally accepted that a competitive mindset is advantageous to successfully compete in sports, no published research has been directed toward defining the competitive mindset of the equestrian at any level of competition. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to quantify mood and psychological skills of elite and sub-elite equestrian athletes. Following written informed consent, 54 equestrian men and women (aged 15–64 yrs) completed a battery of psychometric inventories, consisting of the Profile of Mood States (POMS), and the Psychological Skills Inventory for Sport (PSIS) during the Olympic Trials, or during various equestrian competitions throughout the country. Data were grouped for analyses by rank (elite, sub-elite), event (dressage, show jumping), and descriptively by gender. Elite competitors exhibited significantly higher anxiety management and concentration than sub-elite athletes. Males tended to exhibit higher vigor, but less tension, depression, fatigue, confusion, and total mood disturbance than females. Male athletes also scored higher in anxiety management and confidence, but lower in motivation than female competitors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Focus-group interviews were conducted with 20 elite junior tennis coaches. Results revealed a need for more mental skills training coach education on content information. Understanding how to teach mental skills was also emphasized, as was the need for coaches to become more comfortable with this process. Coaches suggested that mental skills training information could be made more user-friendly through development of hands-on concrete examples and activities, increased mental skills training resources (particularly audio and video formats), and involvement in mental skills coach education efforts.

AB - The purpose of this study was to determine if relationships exist between a history of athletic injury, anxiety, and self-efficacy. The psychological effects of injury on athletes may affect their ability to perform when returning to participation. These effects may have consequences which last beyond their return to participation in their sport. This study examines whether any residual effects on anxiety level and self-efficacy beliefs may be seen in athletes with a history of injury. Two aspects of injury were examined, number of injuries the athlete has suffered, and the severity of those injuries as measured by time out of participation. Small effects for both anxiety and self-efficacy were found for some populations. The time elapsed since the injuries was not included, and may have been a confounding factor. The results of this type of study are relational, not causal, so it cannot be said that injury causes residual anxiety or lowered self-efficacy, but only that they are related.

AB - Understanding youth sport participation has been the emphasis of many researchers over the past 20 years. Although insight as to why youth sport athletes continue and discontinue sport participation has been provided, the past research has not identified how variables, particularly social and psychological variables, interact to affect children's decisions to continue or discontinue their sport participation. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to build on the past research and to examine if youth sport athletes who leave sport differ in their perceptions across time of coaching behaviors, perceptions of social support, level of anxiety and ways of coping from athletes who continue their sport participation. The participants in this study included 132 female youth gymnasts. The gymnasts in the study were participants in the sports of rhythmic and artistic gymnastics. The years of gymnastics participation of the participants ranged from 2 to 12 years. The athletes were training and/or competing in their sport for at least 6 months of the year. The data collection took place over a six month period of time with the gymnasts completing the same set of inventories three times during those six months. The data was examined using Generalized Estimating Equations which accounts for correlated observations over time. The results revealed that the interaction between several variables influenced youth sport participation. Specifically, for gymnasts with higher anxiety and low abilities to cope with adversity are more likely to discontinue participating in gymnastics. Support from family and friends also played a role in gymnast's participation. That is, gymnasts who perceived more support from family and friends were more likely to continue in gymnastics. Finally, gymnasts' participation was also influenced by how they perceived their coaches' behaviors. Gymnasts who perceived their coaches to provide low amounts of non-reinforcement/ignoring mistakes feedback and who perceived their coaches to provide high amounts of punishment oriented feedback, were more likely to discontinue their gymnastics participation. These results moved the sport participation research beyond achievement motivation and expanded our understanding of the relationships between variables which influence sport participation decisions.

AB - Most of the sport psychology literature focuses on athletes; the current research focused on sports fans. This study examined factors that influence spectators' enjoyment of televised sports violence. In a pilot study, a group of experimental subjects assigned roughness ratings to a large pool of videotaped plays from National Football League games. In the main experiment male and female subjects filled out several questionnaires, including a form on which they rated their enjoyment of videotaped plays that fit into the categories of low, medium, and high roughness. Males were found to enjoy the plays in general more so than did the females. Self-rated football fanship was also positively related to enjoyment of the plays in general. In the sample as a whole, the enjoyment of plays was found to increase with the plays' roughness. This effect was especially pronounced among males. No relationship was found between trait anger and enjoyment of football plays, whether plays in general or plays of different roughness levels were examined. In addition, no relationship was found between trait anger and football fanship. Unexpectedly, gender was not found to be related to football fanship; male and female subjects both considered themselves to a fairly equal extent to be football fans.

AB - The purpose of this study was to expand the research associated with the effects of stress on sport officials. The study examined the impact that job congruence, job satisfaction, and social support may have on health among sport officials by testing a mediational model of relationships in a system developed through theory and previous research. Data were collected from 125 sport officials sanctioned to officiate in the state of Iowa. They responded to the Vocational Preference Inventory, Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire, Social Support Questionnaire, Symptom Checklist-90R, and a demographic data sheet. Statistically significant correlations were found between job congruence and positive health outcomes, job satisfaction and positive health outcomes, and job stress and negative health outcomes. A series of regression analyses designed to test for mediation was performed. The results indicated that occupational stress as a sport official is a powerful mediator in the relationship between perceived quality of social support and positive health outcomes. Recommendations for practice and further research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - In an early study, Pierce (1969) found college athletes less likely than other students to seek psychotherapy. Athletes apparently continue to underuse counseling services available to them (Cogan 6 Petrie, 1996a), perhaps because of a reluctance to admit weakness, desire for autonomy, teammates' social support, or fear that they will be perceived as deviant (Andersen, Denson, Brewer, & Van Raalte, 1994; Linder, Pillow, & Reno, 1989). In this chapter the author focuses on four areas of concern, each of which may show increased prevalence among athletes as compared with the general population: substance abuse, eating disorders, sport performance phobic behavior, and sexual abuse. Substance abuse and eating disorders are problems that may be more likely to occur within athlete populations, in part as a function of the context of the athletic environment. Because it has been tied directly to competitive athletics, sport performance-related phobia is also described. And finally, for a number of reasons, treatment of athletes in relation to sexual abuse is also addressed. The athletic environment may be a contributing factor--and there is little published information on this important subject. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(create)

AB - The study was designed to elucidate the development of a number of concepts relevant to young gymnasts' understanding of sport-related pain. The study methodology was based on previous research on children's understanding of pain. Other researchers (Gaffney and Dunne, 1987, 1988; Harbeck & Peterson, 1992) found that children progress through a series of stages, much like Piaget's stages of cognitive development, as they learn about pain. Previous research revealed that younger children have a limited understanding of pain causality, do not appreciate the value of pain, and provide uninformative pain descriptors. Given these results, one may question whether children should participate in sports where they are exposed to pain. In the present study, gymnasts 6 to 13 years of age were interviewed to determine their: (a) ability to distinguish types of sport-related pain; (b) responses to types of sport-related pain; (c) reasons for their responses; (d) understanding of what would happen to their bodies if they continued gymnastics with different types of pain; (e) ability to describe pain they had felt; (f) ability to define an injury; (g) understanding of pain causality; (h) understanding of the value of pain; and (i) use of pain for secondary gain. The effects of age, gender, level of cognitive development, experience with sport, and experience with pain and injury were examined for their influence on participants' understanding of pain concepts. Results revealed that older gymnasts had a more advanced understanding of pain concepts, but that even the younger participants differentiated pain types and made differential responses to the types. Like the results from studies with general populations of children, the results from this study support the development of a knowledge base of sport-related pain concepts that increases with age and experience. Different from previous research was the greater understanding of pain causality and the more sophisticated means by which pain was described by the gymnasts. Results are discussed in the context of theories of cognition and education for coaches and athletes. Future directions for this field of research are identified.

AB - Investigated mental toughness and assessed causal explanations for positive and negative reactions to imagined events using an attributional style questionnaire. Pessimistic explanatory style on this scale was a risk factor for negative affect and behavior following negative events. 38 elite athletes (minimum age 17.8 yrs) in ice hockey were rated for mental toughness by the National Hockey League's scouts on consensually derived criteria. The comparison of players above and below the median split on mental toughness show composite explanations of negative events that were more internal, stable, and global for players above the median. These results suggest that a pessimistic explanatory style may benefit hockey performance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - For the vast majority of collegiate student athletes, sport retirement is an inevitable transition that they will face when finished with college. This study examined the impact a career development course had on fourth and fifth year student athletes who were faced with the sport retirement transition. Twenty-five student athletes who enrolled in the course over two quarters were compared to forty-two student athletes who participated as control group subjects not enrolled in the course. All subjects were tested on career maturity (Career Maturity Inventory), career self-efficacy (Career Decision Making Self-Efficacy Scale), and their readiness to retire (Life Transitions Inventory for Athletes). Students who enrolled in the career development course were trained in the areas of (1) identity exploration, particularly how to identify transferable skills from sports, (2) goal setting, and how to set realistic, achievable non-sport goals, (3) decision making, especially regarding career options and possibly graduate school, (4) communication skills, how to effectively network and interview with employers, (5) career training skills, such as resume writing and conducting an informational interview, and (6) future planning. The course was designed to give support to student athletes coping with this period in their life and to train them in the skills necessary for life after sports. Results of the study found that although participants in the course consistently scored in the expected direction on all three tests, these results were rarely statistically significant, owing in part to small sample size. Effect sizes, on the other hand, consistently were yielded moderate to high. A description of the career program (Positive Transitions), demographic data of the subjects who participated in the study, the research design, and results of the study are provided. Implications for the development of career transition programs are discussed, along with suggestions for future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - The role of the sport psychiatrist consulting to a professional sports team is complex, challenging, and varied. Sport psychiatrists serve to enhance the psychosocial development of the athlete by removing obstacles to growth and by facilitating lines of communication that support the exchange of information, sharing of feelings, and the development of solid winning relationships on the team and throughout the organization. The consultant psychiatrist often provides input to players and to management. These dual responsibilities raise ethical concerns and often require the services of additional treating psychiatrists and other mental health professionals. Case studies involving a female figure skater with an anxiety disorder, a 28-yr-old male pitcher with a substance abuse problem, a male basketball player with depression, a 23-yr-old female volleyball player with an eating disorder are presented, as are case studies dealing with rookie issues and the role of the consultant when working with an entire team.

AB - Smart Golf is a comprehensive approach to improving and scoring the mental game in golf. The five components are preparation, positive focusing (positive self-monitoring), plan, apply, and react. A simple scoring system encourages golfers to self-monitor their use of the Smart Golf approach. In this preliminary evaluation of the efficacy of the approach, 5 experienced golfers ( M years of playing 17.8 yrs; aged 38–57 yrs)) participated in a 4-wk seminar. Process measures indicated the extent to which participants used the approach. Outcome measures included golf scores at pre- and postintervention and at a 3-mo follow-up. Psychological skills were also assessed at pre- and postintervention. Process analyses revealed that Ss used the approach consistently during the seminar and follow-up period. All Ss improved 2 critical psychological skills (emotional control and positive self-talk) as well as their average scores (at postintervention) and handicaps (at follow-up).

The mental training package consisted of relaxation, imagery rehearsal, self-talk, and goal-setting. Ss were 3 male triathletes and 1 male elite runner (aged 25–37 yrs). A single-subject multiple baseline across individuals design was employed to evaluate the treatment package. Results demonstrate that the mental training package was effective in improving the running performance of the 3 Ss who received intervention. Social validation results were favorable and indicated that Ss enjoyed using the mental training package and were pleased with the results. Further, coaches felt that the results were important, especially those for the elite track athlete. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Subjects (n = 319) were high school and college track athletes. Research Question (RQ) #1 found no statistically significant results. RQ #2 indicated that high-task/low-ego (HTLE) males were significantly higher in TSC than low-task/low-ego (LTLE) males and LTHE groups. For FISS, HTLE had significantly higher scores than LTLE and LTHE groups. HTLE females had significantly higher FISS than LTLE females. RQ #3 indicated males who were HTLE scored higher on TSC and FISS than males who were LTHE and LTHE males were older than males who were HTLE. RQ #4 indicated that task orientation emerged as a significant predictor of FISS for males and females. Task orientation also emerged as a significant predictor of TSC for males. Both task orientation and age emerged as significant predictors of TSC for females. RQ #5 indicated that males and females high in TSC were more task oriented than males and females low in TSC. RQ #6 indicated males and females high in FISS were more task oriented than males and females low in FISS. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Special attention is paid to results of scientific research on the influence of sports-recreational programs on the improvement of psychological, functional, and motor characteristics of persons with a disability. The suggested procedures are directed toward application of sports-recreational programs for the improvement of psychosomatic characteristics during and immediately after clinical rehabilitation and on arrival at home. Roles of the organization "Sport for all" and of the wider social environment are emphasized. One role is the designing of organizational, professional, and executive procedures necessary for engaging persons with a disability in programs that, apart from their medical effects, also have the goal of increasing quality of life.

These factors are: professional boundaries; professional philosophy; making contact; assessment; conceptualizing athletes' concerns and potential interventions; range, types, and organization of service; program implementation; managing the self as an intervention instrument; program and consultant evaluation; conclusions and implications; and leaving the setting. All 11 factors represent important considerations for applied sport psychology professionals. Although consultants each have their own unique style and approach, these 11 factors are prerequisite considerations that form the foundation of a consultant's effective practice. These guidelines may provide direction for a practitioner's professional development, and as such, need time and commitment to be realized.

AB - Comments on the article by W. B. Strean and H. S. Strean (see record 1998-04096-007) regarding psychodynamic theory in sport psychology practice. The present author argues that psychodynamic ideas imply that the children adults once were remain with them, and that this "child's" wishes must not be equated with those consciously recognized. The existence of unconscious thought does not mean that it is the predominant motivating factor behind behavior. Understanding how unconscious processes operate does not determine which intervention is most appropriate or effective. Giges contends that by defining psychodynamic theory as both a theory and a form of therapeutic intervention, Strean and Strean create an ambiguity that may cause difficulty for practitioners who are not clinically trained. While Strean and Strean intended to demonstrate how psychoanalysis can be adapted to sport psychology consulting, they do not clearly demonstrate how that can be done. Giges concludes that this theory can be useful in sport psychology practice if it is translated into techniques that are within the province of sport psychology consultants. Applying procedures drawn from psychodynamic psychotherapy be be inappropriate unless the practitioner has received such training and supervised experience.

AB - Although there is empirical and anecdotal evidence for the efficacy of athletic performance enhancement interventions, a relatively small percentage of athletes take advantage of sport psychology services. It is likely that athletes perceive potential gains and losses in pursuing mental skills training, and the latter may adversely impact athletes' motivations and behaviors regarding consulting a sport psychologist. In order to increase the number of athletes who can benefit from mental skills training, athletes' motivations and behaviors regarding sport psychology consultation must be addressed. The Transtheoretical model of change focuses on the related issues of motivation and behavior change through the constructs of the Stages of Change, Processes of Change, Decisional Balance, and Self-Efficacy. Although the Transtheoretical model has been applied to a variety of behaviors, it has not been applied theoretically or empirically to the area of sport psychology consultation. In an attempt to apply the Transtheoretical Model to this area, questionnaires assessing Stage of Change, Decisional Balance, and Self-Efficacy were developed and cross-validated on two samples (total N = 308) of NCAA Division I Intercollegiate Athletes. The measures showed good internal reliability, with all but one subscale yielding an alpha coefficient of.79 or above, and good construct validity, exhibiting hypothesized relationships among each other and with relevant outcome variables. Finally, the Stage of Change measure exhibited a strong relationship with sport psychology consultations initiated by athletes during the 12 months following questionnaire administration. Of those athletes in the Precontemplation stage, 21% initiated an individual sport psychology consultation in the following year, compared with 39% of those in the Contemplation stage and 63% of those in the Action stage. Based on these results, it appears that the Stage of Change measure developed in the present research may prove to be a useful tool in predicting subsequent initiation of individual sport psychology consultation. Several potentially useful lines of research flow from this study, including continued development of assessment tools, and experiments designed to assess the efficacy of stage-based sport psychology interventions in moving athletes to later stages of change and to greater levels of participation in sport psychology consultation.

AB - This study investigated what the "human experience of being in the zone" is like for people. Most sports fans are familiar with this terminology that is commonly associated with athletes taking their game to another or higher level of play. These extraordinary "feats of magic" are a phenomenon to behold. The study supports the thesis that "peak performance" is attained by both psychological (mental) and physiological (physical) conditioning. This research also illustrated the importance of the "spiritual dimension" of the phenomenological process and its relationship to improved performance. The culmination of the mind turning itself over to the movements and rhythms, of the body, results in a "synergic reaction" leading to excellence. This "synergy" accounts for the development of a strong sense of self-confidence, in the human psyche, and the "feeling that one can do anything they set out to do". This phenomena is an integral part of athletic achievement motivation, and success. This study also investigated the "shared human experiences" of co-researchers in combination with my own "intense, personal internal search". The investigation of co-researchers, who also "intensely" experienced this phenomenon, revealed certain commonalities amongst themselves; as well as, the project investigator, e.g., the importance of commitment, self-confidence, and "a feeling of being in total control" as it relates to the attainment of peak performance. This data is further illustrated through individual self-portraits; as well as, the use of a group composite (which highlights similarities and differences). Each self-portrait includes a brief sketch and synopsis of the respective individual's "human experience" with the aforementioned phenomenon. In summary, the importance of the body and mind's convergence in sport can not be underestimated. The synchronization of mentally and physically directed energy is key. This mental and physical training is paramount to successful goal attainment. Athletes must practice both their "physical and mental skills" to excel. Coaches and team management can benefit from this information in order to harness it, as a tool, to maximize team productivity. This research and "human knowledge" benefits our society, as a whole, by sharing insights into the vital importance and joys of exercise, physical fitness; "positive inner self-talk"; meditation; mental imagery; and any other useful "mental rehearsal techniques" to improve performance in the world of work and everyday life.

AB - Examines the efficacy of 3 different interventions on participants matched by degree of debilitative cognitive anxiety. The study involved 41 college students who were athletes, and who identified themselves as suffering from debilitative cognitive anxiety. The Ss completed an anxiety inventory that assessed both intensity and direction of state anxiety, within 1 hr of a competitive sport Invasion Game. Semi-structured interviews with Ss were also conducted after the interventions. Three matched groups were given different treatments. These were Cognitive-Affective Stress Management (multimodal), Positive Thought Control (unimodal compatible), and Applied Relaxation (unimodal noncompatible). A control group was given placebo tasks. A compatible technique is one that is known to to be more effective with a certain type of anxiety. After the 6-wk interventions, Ss were again assessed before a 2nd competitive Invasion Game. Results show that the multimodal intervention is most effective overall. However, the multimodel intervention is found to be slightly less effective than the unimodal compatible intervention, with cognitive anxiety direction. The unimodal compatible treatment takes about half the time to deliver to participants as the multimodal treatment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - This article discusses ways in which consultant characteristics and styles interact to influence intervention effectiveness in applied sport psychology. In particular, it is designed to provide therapists, counselors and psychologists with consulting guidelines that research and experience suggest are important for successfully implementing educationally-based mental skills training programs for athletes. Areas discussed include: (1) gaining entry and connecting with athletes; (2) identifying program objectives; (3) identifying specific strategies to achieve program objectives; (4) scheduling mental skills training; and (5) evaluating program effectiveness. It is emphasized that effective sport psychological consulting is a dynamic process including a collaborative relationship between the athlete, coach and sport psychologist.

AB - The present study investigated the relationship of subjective well-being in college student-athletes with the type of sport played and motivation for participation. Specifically, motivation was investigated as a possible mediating influence in the relationship between sport participation and subjective well-being. One hundred twenty-four undergraduate student athletes, ranging in age from 18 to 23, participating in a sport requiring interpersonal support, physical exertion, or emotional arousal, were assessed for participation motivation, subjective well-being, and academic adjustment. Specific sports included basketball, football, long-distance running, and soccer. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the results. Analyses of variance revealed that those student athletes participating in a sport requiring physical exertion had significantly higher physical well-being than athletes in the two other types of sport studied. None of the sports studied could be differentiated by their motivation for participation. Additionally, no evidence was found to suggest motivation as a mediating influence in the relationship between sport participation and subjective well-being. Most notable were the findings that those athletes participating in a sport requiring physical exertion reported the highest subjective well-being on all three domains of well-being studied (social, physical, emotional), in addition to reporting the highest academic adjustment. The results are discussed with respect to limitations, practical implications, and future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - This dissertation addresses the issue of why under conditions of stress some people stay physically and psychologically healthy while others become ill. Being able to deal with stress, to cope with the pressures of daily life, and yet stay healthy, is seen as a function of such factors as physical health, psychological health, constitutional predisposition, social support, exercise habits, and personality. This study examined the moderating effects of personality (hardiness and sense of coherence), sports participation (college varsity athletes and college nonathletes), and gender on the relationship between perceived stress and psychological symptoms. College varsity athletes (n = 135) and college nonathletes (n = 135), all undergraduates at New York University, completed four questionnaires: Hardiness Scale, Sense of Coherence Scale, Daily Hassles Scale, and Profile of Mood States. Participants also completed a background questionnaire providing basic demographic data. Psychological symptoms and perceived stress were the criterion variables; hardiness, sense of coherence, sports participation, and gender were the predictor variables. Multiple regression and correlational analyses were applied to the resulting data and used to answer the research questions and to test the research hypotheses. There was a significant positive correlation between perceived stress and psychological symptoms among college varsity athletes and college nonathletes. There was a significant positive correlation between the personality scales of Hardiness and Sense of Coherence for both college varsity athletes and college nonathletes. When controlling for gender, college varsity athletes on the average scored significantly higher on hardiness, scored slightly higher on sense of coherence, and reported significantly less perceived stress and significantly fewer psychological symptoms than the college nonathletes. Comparing by gender, no statistically significant mean differences were found on the four main variables. A significant negative correlation was observed between personality hardiness and perceived stress and psychological symptoms for the total sample. However, the college nonathletes subsample showed no significant effect between hardiness and perceived stress. Finally, there was a significant negative correlation between sense of coherence and perceived stress and psychological symptoms for both the college varsity athletes and college nonathletes.

AB - The study's intents were two-fold: (1) to examine Association for the Advancement of Applied Sport Psychology (AAASP) members' perceptions regarding the acceptability of coaches delivering psychological interventions (PI) to their athletes; and (2) to determine what PI, if any, coaches are administering to their athletes. AAASP members were mailed a survey with a 67.77% (N = 143) return rate. A separate questionnaire was mailed to National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I baseball (N = 145; 37.08%), softball (N = 131, 60.37%), and tennis (N = 431; 65.11%) coaches. AAASP participants were mailed a second questionnaire (N = 106; 74%) with one year between administrations to establish the reliability of the questionnaire. Intraclass reliability coefficients ranged from.40 to.57 across a one year duration. The factor analysis revealed that AAASP participants clustered PI into three categories: (1) performance enhancement interventions; (2) personal/developmental concerns; and (3) issues focusing on clinical concerns. However, the MANOVA results did not yield any statistically significant differences regarding which PI category, if any, was more appropriate for a coach to administer. Educational background appeared to have a significant impact upon the AAASP members' perceptions. Those from a physical education background were more inclined, than those from a counseling/psychology program, to condone coaches' administration of certain PI (e.g., visualization, relaxation techniques, attention training). While only 21% of coaches used sport psychology services, 93% indicated that they were willing to use a sport psychologist. Cost, availability of a qualified sport psychologist, and time limitations were factors that hindered their utilization of sport psychology services. Furthermore, experienced coaches revealed that they used PI more than those coaches with limited experience. Except for issues involving grief, no statistically significant difference existed between male and female coaches use of PI. Finally, coaches indicated that they were administering PI with their athletes, regardless of their professional training. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Explored the moderating effect of psychological reactance on the success of traditional and paradoxical mental imagery treatments that were aimed at reducing anxiety in athletes. 43 male and 30 female intramural college basketball players (mean age 19.81 yrs) were recruited through advertisements for a free-throw contest, and their anxiety and free-throw performance were measured following treatment in 1 of 3 groups: confidence imagery, paradoxical imagery, or control. In the paradoxical condition, high-reactant athletes reported having significantly lower somatic state anxiety and significantly higher state self-confidence than did low-reactant athletes. In contrast, high- and low-reactant athletes did not differ in their anxiety scores in both the confidence imagery and control conditions. Results suggest that reactance does moderate the effect of the success of traditional and paradoxical imagery treatments for reducing athletes' anxiety.

AB - The study and practice of sport psychology has gained notoriety and acceptance among athletes, coaches, and professionals in the fields of exercise science and psychology (Vealey, 1992; Feltz, 1992). Applied sport psychology focuses upon the psychological condition of the athlete, the psychological conditions involved in athletic performance, and methods to facilitate the development of necessary psychological skills. The number of athletes and coaches who are recognizing the need for structured, systematic psychological skills training programs (PST) has increased in recent years. Sport psychology practitioners are increasingly being called upon to assist athletes and coaches in the development and enhancement of the psychological skills involved in sport performance. This study examines the development, implementation, and evaluation of a PST program requested by a coach of a collegiate swim team. The Psychological Skills Inventory for Sport-R5 was administered during the pre-, mid-, and post-season to assess athletes' knowledge and application of psychological skills. The seasonal rate of improvement was compared to an average rate of improvement across previous seasons to examine the possible impact of PST on performance. No significant statistical results were obtained on the outcome measures. Despite this fact, athletes and the coach rated the PST program as worthwhile and suggested the program be further refined and integrated into team practice routines.

AB - Examined the individual differences in cognitive preferences by analyzing the effects of imagery and self-talk training on the psychological skills and performance levels of amateur golfers. 32 29–59 yr old amateur golfers participated in a series of 4 counterbalanced training workshops conducted over 2 mo at 2 golf clubs, and completed self-report questionnaires including the Golf Performance Survey (GPS) and the Sports Imagery Questionnaire (SIQ). Results show a significant improvement on 5 psychological and psychomotor skills measured by the GPS: negative emotions and cognitions, mental preparation, automaticity, putting skill, and seeking improvement. Ss' responses to the SIQ and ratings of their imagery and self-talk techniques increased after training. Ss also lowered their handicaps and performed better on a Golf Skills Test after training. Implications for practitioners working with athletes and the use of cognitive interventions are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Although the premise that sports activities may be beneficial to the psychological and physical growth of youngsters is not a new concept, past research has been conflicting and has been conducted with either males or young children. Few studies have targeted adolescent sportswomen. Given the contradictions surrounding past research, the dramatic increase of females in sports, and the scarcity of literature on adolescent sportswomen, this study investigated the impact of team sports on the well-being of a sample of adolescent sportswomen. Past studies examined only motives for participation and outcomes of sports involvement. The unique feature of this study was the development of the linking inventory which examined whether respondents would recognize that certain features of a sports program could promote positive outcomes. Three main objectives were assessed: reasons for participation, outcomes, and recognition of the linkages between features of the sports experience and positive outcomes. Based on the literature, 11 variables were identified as positive features of sports participation: increasing athletic competence, achieving through competition, maintaining physical fitness, physical attractiveness, gaining status, establishing a social niche, building parental relationships, developing academic responsibility, daily responsibility, increasing confidence, and promoting self-worth. Three inventories assessed: reasons for participation, recognition of the linkages, and outcomes. The latter two inventories were based on Harter's Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents (1988). The inventories and a demographic survey were administered to 130 adolescent sportswomen. Results indicated that respondents entered team sports to increase athletic skills, to enjoy competition, and to maintain physical fitness. They recognized the linkages between athletic participation and positive outcomes in most domains. Outcome scores were high in all domains, except appearance, in (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - This study examined the relationship between four levels of subjective meaning; demographic information, personal sport incentives, sense of self, and perceived behavioral options, and compliance to prescribed relaxation exercises. Fifty-six intercollegiate athletes completed questionnaires assessing the dimensions of meaning and were taught a progressive muscle relaxation technique. Compliance was defined as following a prescribed set of behaviors, which involved completion of prescribed relaxation exercises and attendance to scheduled appointments. Multiple regression analyses indicated that each component of meaning held elements that predicted compliance behaviors. Athletes who displayed more compliant behavior tended to be female, had high self-motivation, greater perceived team emphasis, less somatic anxiety, a task mastery orientation toward sport, greater confidence in own ability to complete relaxation, were involved in a sport that probably had a closed-skill orientation, and had enhanced confidence in their own athletic ability.

AB - The purpose of this study was to investigate University of Kansas (KU) athletes' utilization of sport psychology services provided by the University of Kansas Peak Performance Clinic (PPC). Service utilization research was defined as the study of clients' patterns of service use, and potential influences on service usage. The subjects for this investigation were 340 male and female Division I collegiate athletes from KU. Subjects completed the survey instrument; the Collegiate Athletes' Survey. The data from this instrument were analyzed using descriptive, inferential, and nonparametric statistics. Statistical significance for all analyses was alpha <.05. Findings showed that 69.7% of athletes were aware of the services provided by the PPC. A total of 76 (22.4%) athletes indicated using Individual Consulting Services (ICS). However, a higher level of ICS use was obtained (33.3%) with the removal of freshmen athletes (N = 115) from the analysis. Results also revealed a cause-effect relationship between awareness and service use, suggesting that higher levels of awareness contributed to higher service usage. Further, athletes' use of ICS was found to be mediated by athletes' age, residence, academic standing, sport, and playing status. Also, the variable "individual sports" emerged as the strongest predictor of athletes' ICS use (phi = .39, phi2 = .15, p = .001). After their initial consultation with a sport psychologist, most athletes (N = 59) indicated that they returned for more services. They also indicated that they were highly satisfied with the sport psychology services received (M = 4.0, SD = .85), and that they were intent to use the services in the future. Athletes also showed positive attitudes toward athletes who seek sport psychology services (M = 4.29, SD = .83) regardless of whether they have had a personal experience with a sport psychologist. Results also showed that most of the reasons for athletes' underutilization of (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - 45 19–27 yr olds were assessed for cognitive anxiety on the Sport Competition Anxiety Test (R. Martens, 1982; Martens et al, 1990). Two-mo later Ss observed a person performing a new motor task which required high cognitive processing to be performed well. After this observation, 22 Ss were randomly assigned to a Mental Practice and 23 to a Control group. The former performed a cognitive rehearsal of the task, whereas the latter did not. None practiced the task physically before being tested. ANOVA shows that both errors and performance time interacted significantly with Mental Practice vs Control group scores and scores on the Sport Competition Anxiety Test. Among Ss who practiced mentally, those scoring low on cognitive anxiety performed significantly better than Ss who scored high. The relationship between test scores of cognitive anxiety and performance for the total sample was analyzed by different curvilinear regression models. A cubic model formed a polynomial relationship between cognitive anxiety test scores and error in performance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - The present investigation had two purposes. First, to examine whether a group of young competitive figure skaters could effectively learn and use mental training skills taught to them during a mental training program intervention. Second, to examine to what extent the skaters could learn and use the three primary mental training skill components from Orlick's heuristic model of personal excellence (i.e., imagery, focusing, and refocusing). A group of 17 female competitive figure skaters (mean age 13.6 years) were divided into two groups--experimental 1 and experimental 2. Measures used to assess mental skills and trait anxiety were taken on three occasions--pre-test, post-simulation, and follow-up. The measures included both qualitative (short-answer and interview responses) and quantitative (Sport Competition Anxiety Test, Commitment to Sport and Self-Control Scales) methods of assessment. The pre-test measures were taken prior to any subjects receiving the mental training program. The post-simulation measures were taken after a simulated competition when only the experimental group 1 skaters had completed the mental training program. Follow-up measures were taken several months after all skaters (both experimental 1 and experimental 2) had received the mental training. Comparisons done between pre-test and post-simulation measures, and pre-test and follow-up measures were used to assess the effectiveness of the mental training program. Results from the pre-test--post-simulation comparisons showed virtually no change following the experimental group 1 training. Comparisons of the pre-test--follow-up measures did show improvements in the skaters' imagery, focusing and refocusing skills. The discussion examines factors which contributed to the mental training program success, aspects of the program found most useful by the skaters, and gives suggestions for future research in this area.

AB - The process of grief was hypothesized as the emotional reaction experienced by athletes who had retired from professional or elite competition. In addition to this hypothesis, it was hypothesized that the grief process was exacerbated by the existence of athletes neurosis, commonly identified as a variable in those who compete athletically. Three study groups were used for the purpose of this study; athletes who had retired from competition within the past year (retired athletes), currently competing athletes (competing athletes), and individuals who had experienced the death of a loved one within the past year (bereaved). The existence of grief was measured by using both the Grief Experience Inventory (GEI) and the Roberts Grief Analysis Scale (RGAS). Neuroticism was measured by using the Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI). It was hypothesized that retired and competing athletes would rate higher on neuroticism than bereaved individuals (hypothesis I), while both bereaved individuals and retired athletes would rate higher on measures of grief than competing athletes (hypothesis II). Additionally, it was believed that within the group of retired athletes those who had displayed higher levels of neuroticism would similarly display higher levels of grief (hypothesis III). Analysis of results indicated support for both hypothesis II and III, while analysis of results for hypothesis I presented both bereaved and competing athletes as experiencing higher levels of neuroticism than retired athletes. Explanations for the obtained results were discussed along with recommendations for future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Psychological constructs identified by the PSIS included anxiety management, concentration, confidence, mental preparation, motivation, and team emphasis. Wilks's criterion indicated no significant differences in psychological skills across events. Males scored significantly higher in anxiety management, concentration, and confidence than did females. Highly skilled Ss scored significantly higher in anxiety management, concentration, confidence, and motivation than did lower skilled Ss. Collegiate rodeo athletes exhibit psychological skill patterns inconsistent with athletes in more traditional sports. Assessment of psychological skills may enhance predictions of athletic potential in this sport. (French abstract) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - The major purpose of this study was to develop and standardize a questionnaire to measure athletes' attitudes toward seeking sport psychology consultation. A 50-item questionnaire was developed and administered to 48 African-American (14 female and 34 male) and 177 Caucasian (79 female and 98 male) athletes ranging from 17 to 23 years of age at an NCAA Division I university. Principle components factor analyses were conducted to extract initial factors, followed by varimax orthogonal rotation. The results revealed three dimensions of athlete attitude toward sport psychology consultation representing 35% of the variance: stigma tolerance, confidence/recognition of need, and personal openness. A secondary purpose of this study was to determine whether attitudes toward seeking sport psychology consultation of athletes differed as a function of gender and race. A MANOVA and follow-up univariate analysis was performed on the factors to identify which ones maximized differences among race and gender groups. Factor 1, stigma tolerance, was significant for race, F(1, 210) = 19.36, p =.0001, omega2 =.07; and for gender, F(1, 210) = 44.13, p =.0001, omega2 =.16. No other significant effects were obtained. However, 2 (Gender) times 2 (Race) ANOVAs were performed on each item of the questionnaire which revealed that male athletes exhibited a greater stigma towards sport psychology, whereas, females viewed a sport psychology consultant (SPC) as someone that could help them enhance their athletic performance. Moreover, compared with Caucasian athletes, African-American athletes were less likely to think that an SPC could help them perform better, were more apprehensive about going to an SPC because they feared they would be harassed by teammates or receive a bad reputation, were less likely to self-disclose, were less committed to following the instructions of an SPC, and were more comfortable with an SPC who was of the same race and gender as them.

AB - A series of studies conducted in the US has indicated that undergraduates, older male sport fans, and college athletes have similar perceptions of sport psychologists. The purpose of this research was to explore 17 female and 15 male British athletes' perceptions of sport psychologists. Athletes were recruited from sports science classes, and questionnaires were distributed in the classroom. Results of correspondence analysis indicate that British athletes hold perceptions of sport psychologists that are similar to those held by US college athletes. Sport psychologists were perceived to be similar to mental health practitioners in general and more similar to sport-related practitioners than other mental health consultants.

AB - Investigated the perceptions of 482 certified athletic trainers concerning their attitudes, beliefs, and application of psychological strategies and techniques in the treatment and rehabilitation of athletic injuries. Ss completed the Athletic Training and Sport Psychology Questionnaire. 47% of Ss believed that every injured athlete suffers psychological trauma. 24% reported that they had referred an athlete for counseling for situations related to their injury, and 25% reported that they had a sport psychologist as a member of their sports medicine team. Almost 90% of Ss reported that it was "relatively important" or "very important" to treat the psychological aspect of an athletic injury. Implications for addressing the psychological aspects of injury treatment in the education of athletic trainers, and for the development of a sport psychology referral network are discussed.

AB - A phenomenological research investigation was conducted on the professional athlete's experience of moving out of a slump. Methods of preparation, data collection and analysis of data guided the research. Participants provided detailed descriptions and depictions of their experience through open-ended interviews. Eleven co-researchers described thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations and other effects connected with their experience. Transcripts of the interview material were analyzed, employing Phenomenological Reduction and Eidetic Variation and culminating in a Textural-Structural Synthesis. Professional athletes find the experience of moving out of a slump painful. The process begins with the ownership of the slump. Frustration, fear, self-doubt and low self-esteem are qualities of their experience and are dominant throughout the process. Commitment to work ethic and the return to basics provide the determination and resources for movement out of a slump. Obsessive analysis is abandoned; workouts are simplified. Risk taking and minor successes follow. Self-confidence increases. The focus is intense and pure. Feelings of invincibility eventually break through and lead the athlete out of the slump.

AB - Highlights areas of psychopathology particularly relevant to sport and exercise, reviews empirical research on the epidemiology of psychopathology in sport and exercise populations, and provides recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of psychopathology in the context of sport and exercise. It is concluded that athletes do experience psychopathology, such as eating disorders and substance abuse, at rates equal to and sometimes greater then the general population. Second, psychopathology specific to or exacerbated by sport or exercise involvement also exists. Third, research examining psychopathology in sport and exercise participants has been lacking, thus comments concerning this area still are tentative. Epidemiological, longitudinal, and well-controlled studies need to be conducted to expand the knowledge base. Finally, when treating psychopathology, it is essential that circumstances specific to sport and exercise be taken into consideration.(introduction) provided recommendations for treatment and prevention as warranted by current research psychopathology relevant to sport and exercise [eating disorders, substance-related disorders, psychological factors affecting medical condition, adjustment reactions, various disorders and subclinical syndromes] / recommendations for diagnosis and treatment (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)

AB - This study was designed to investigate the incidence of conduct disorder among an adolescent population whose parents abuse substances and to see whether athletic participation among these youth made a difference in the incidence of their conduct disorder. A sample of 10 adolescents and their parents participated in this study. The parents were given a demographic background questionnaire and a series of statements regarding substance abuse to assess which of the parents were abusing substances. The adolescents who participated in this study were given the Adolescent Multiphasic Personality Inventory (AMPI) both before and after the three month sports program to see if there was a difference in the pre and posttest scores. A one tailed t test for paired samples supported the hypothesis that conduct disorder scores of adolescents whose parents abuse substances, would be lower following attendance in the three month sports program than the scores of the same adolescents prior to participating in the sports program. Mean AMPI scores of adolescents following attendance was significantly lower (mean = 9.05) than prior to attendance (mean = 9.85), t(9) = 2.06, p <.

AB - The discipline of sport psychology has grown significantly during the past 15 years, presenting several challenges regarding the professional integrity of the field. Perhaps the most important issue is the debate over the use of the title sport psychologist; for the title psychologist to be used, a professional must meet the statutory requirements for licensure as a psychologist. However, many practitioners in sport psychology are educated in sport sciences and untrained in mental heath practice. In response to these issues the Association for the Advancement of Applied Sport Psychology has created the credential "Certified Consultant, AAASP", to provide recognition for sport-science trained professionals in sport psychology. This study is designed to investigate the impact of the titles certified consultant, AAASP, sport psychologist, psychiatrist, and coach on athletes' perceptions of the functions and activities performed by each professional, the personal characteristics of each professional, and subjects' willingness to seek help from these professionals for specific problems. Subjects were 384 male and female athletes from three NCAA Division I universities and one NAIA Division II college. Subjects gave informed consent and completed a survey which measured functions/activities, personal characteristics, and help-seeking attitudes. Results indicate that subjects perceive distinct roles and qualities for sport psychologists, psychiatrists, and coaches; roles for the certified consultant were less clear. Certified consultants were perceived less as helpers, and more as strategists or business people; sport psychologists are viewed as mental health professionals who also perform activities specifically related to helping athletes. Athletes were significantly more likely to consult their coaches for athletic and academic problems, and more likely to consult the sport psychologist or psychiatrist for emotional problems.

AB - The problem. This study examined the relationship between competitive anxiety and age in three different groups of women tennis players, aged 17 to 89, to determine whether competitive anxiety was related to age. Method. Three groups of women tennis players were studied: (1) 34 world-class tennis players, aged 17 to 45, coupled with 66 professional tennis instructors certified, aged 25 to 78; (2) 220 adult and senior competitors, aged 26 to 89; and (3) 141 National Collegiate Athletic Association collegiate competitors, aged 17 to 26-years-old. Each subject completed a demographic questionnaire, the Sport Competition Anxiety Test for Adults (SCAT-A), and the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2 (CSAI-2). An analysis of covariance was used to assess the relationship between age, cognitive state anxiety, and somatic state anxiety, while controlling for player group and competitive trait anxiety. Within each group of subjects, a partial correlation coefficient was calculated after removing the effect of competitive trait anxiety. Results. Study results revealed that significant differences were found to exist in age, competitive trait anxiety, cognitive state anxiety, and somatic state anxiety, for the entire sample. Additionally, significant differences were generally found to exist in age, competitive trait anxiety, cognitive state anxiety, and somatic state anxiety, within the three separate player groups. From the results, three main conclusions were drawn: (1) Competitive trait anxiety gradually declined as the competitor aged. (2) Cognitive state anxiety gradually declined as the competitor aged. (3) Somatic state anxiety gradually declined as the competitor aged. Additionally, the results for the entire sample indicated that, irrespective of age, the adult and senior tennis players demonstrated the lowest levels of competitive trait anxiety, cognitive state anxiety, and somatic state anxiety. The college tennis team players were highest in competitive trait anx (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - The purpose of this research was to investigate the phenomenon of breakaway into the zone, as experienced and described by athletes. A phenomenological research approach was employed, revealing the nature and essential meaning of the experience. The research results were obtained from in-depth guided interviews of sixteen athletes representing thirteen different sports. Ranging in age from 24 to 59 years, fourteen of the participants were American, one was from Canada, and one was from Austria. The methods and procedures for analyzing the data involved Epoche (suspending prejudgment), phenomenological reduction, and eidetic variation. A final synthesis was composed of the textural-structural descriptions of the experience. The findings of the study indicate that breakaway into the zone, an extraordinary sport experience, can have a profound and lasting impact on a person's life. The core themes derived from the participant interviews include: (1) sensation of moving in a flowing, effortless manner with no pain or discomfort; (2) total immersion and clarity of focus; (3) athlete overcomes all fears, inhibitions, and negative thinking; (4) experience is marked by extraordinary strength and endurance, heightened energy, and an increased ability to function; (5) fusion of the mind-body dichotomy; (6) alterations in temporal and visual perception; (7) transcendent dimension involving changes in spatial and auditory perception; (8) premonition, tacit awareness, intuitive sense; (9) experience was unplanned and occurred in stages; and (10) joyful, euphoric, and personally satisfying. The results were explored in relation to the existing research of optimal sport experiences. Several distinctions were highlighted between breakaway into the zone and previous studies of peak experiences, peak performance, and flow. One of the significant findings of this investigation is that breakaway into the zone is a nonvoluntary, euphoric state that occurs in building levels with endura (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Although athletes participating in various sports have been found to experience mood changes after exercise, little information about the specific properties of exercise and how these influence mood changes is available. Furthermore, little attention has been given to gender differences in mood research. These and other psychological effects of exercise were studied using samples of male and female high school students (n = 106) from The Dalton School. Teams and physical education classes were selected in order to contrast the various mood enhancing properties of sports. It was predicted that hierarchal mood differences existed among sport groups in anxiety and depression change from pre to post-exercise. Earlier research suggested that a sport was more likely to enhance mood if it was aerobic, non-competitive, enjoyable and temporally/spatially certain. Based on the aforementioned criteria, track was predicted to be the most mood enhancing followed by tennis and baseball, whereas no change was predicted for a group of dodgeball controls. Another hypothesis predicted that those with greater initial anxiety and depression would experience more reduction in these moods. Since previous research has shown that females typically are more depressed and anxious than males, it was predicted that not only would the girls show greater pre-exercise levels of mood disturbance, but also that they would experience greater alleviation of negative moods. Contrary to the hypothesis, no hierarchal group differences were discovered for anxiety or depression change from pre to postexercise. Dalton athletes and control females had generally healthier mood profiles than normative samples while control males were similar to norms. Exercise was found to be more anxiolytic and antidepressant for individuals who were initially higher in these states. Since females in this sample were found to be more depressed and anxious, they experienced significantly more psychological benefits from exerc (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Reviews the book, Mental Disorder in the Criminal Process: Stan Stress and the Vietnam/Sports Conspiracy by Grant H. Morris and Allen C. Snyder (1993). Morris and Snyder's book shows the criminal law at its inefficient, clumsy worst. The book focuses exclusively on a single, fascinating case, the tragic story of Stan Stress. Stress's life began to unravel in the late 1960s. After being passed over for a promotion in the navy at age 44, a suicide gesture led to his nonmedical, honorable discharge. The overall usefulness of a book that will be read differently by readers with divergent perspectives on these issues. One of the virtues of the authors' terseness, in the face of extensive and compelling primary source documentation, is that it permits a diversity of interpretation. And the innovative style helps to make a powerful, implicit point, that after all the theorizing is done, the law is finally about people and their problems and its justice is properly evaluated in terms of how it addresses the needs and solves the problems of those people.

Four general categories of research are identified: mental practice, precompetition imagery, comparisons of successful and unsuccessful competitors, and mediating variables. Mediating variables include imagery ability, perspective, and outcome, as well as imagery combined with relaxation. The conclusion is reached that mental practice research has produced equivocal results. The argument is made that the mental practice model for research into imagery processes in sports is nonproductive. Guidelines for productive imagery research in sport are provided.

Several components of skilled performance in golf were identified through factor analysis of these ratings, followed by comparisons between lower handicap and higher handicap players. Skilled golfers (those with lower handicaps) reported greater mental preparation, a higher level of concentration when playing golf, fewer negative emotions and cognitions, greater psychomotor automaticity, and more commitment to golf. Three self-report assessment scales (measures of psychological skills and tactics, psychomotor skills, and golf involvement) were developed from the data. Contexts in which these scales can be used are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - 36 competitive sportsmen and 36 inactive men were compared. Session 1 involved exercise to exhaustion to assess maximal oxygen consumption (MOC). In Session 2, Ss were randomized into 3 experimental conditions: 20 min of exercise at high intensity, moderate intensity, or a light exercise control. Following 30-min recovery, all Ss performed mental arithmetic and public speech tasks in a counterbalanced order. Sportsmen had higher MOV and lower resting heart rate than inactive men. Systolic pressure was lower during mental arithmetic and during recovery from the speech task in the high-intensity than in the control group. Diastolic pressure was lower following mental arithmetic in the high-intensity group. Baroreceptor reflex sensitivity was inhibited during mental arithmetic.

AB - Hypothesizes that an emphasis on enjoyment of physical activity may have significant positive outcomes by facilitating continued involvement in activity and by countering stress and facilitating positive psychological health. Pertinent research is reviewed in support of this hypothesis. Enjoyment and adherence are considered with respect to exercise goals, social interaction, and challenge and competence. Enjoyment and psychological benefits are considered with respect to attitudinal and personality factors, intrinsic motivation, and mindfulness. Although the underlying processes linking enjoyment to psychological health are unspecified, the association appears sufficiently strong to warrant serious consideration by those using physical activity as a treatment for such maladies as anxiety and depression.

A chronological account of Stan Stress's case and his obsessive belief in a Vietnam/sports conspiracy is interlaced with evaluations by lawyers, psychologists, and psychiatrists and with the authors' critiques and questions about key issues in the interface between law and psychiatry. This multi-purpose book offers invaluable background for students and teachers, lawyers and mental health professionals to consider. Stan Stress's case is an important one which raises major questions in the treatment of mentally disordered individuals who are involved in the criminal justice process. The text consists of a brief introduction and six chapters which present the various stages of Stan's involvement in the criminal justice process between 1983 and 1989.

AB - 111 football players from 2 NCAA Division II colleges, 1 with and 1 without athletic counseling/sport psychology services, were asked to indicate how strongly they would recommend drafting a quarterback who had worked with his coaches, a sport psychologist, or a psychotherapist to improve his performance. In neither college did Ss derogate other athletes who were said to have consulted sport psychologists. Study 2 examined 53 of these Ss' perceptions of various sport and mental health professionals. Similarity judgments of the practitioners were analyzed using correspondence analysis, and rankings of the practitioners on 3 dimensions (expertise in sport-related, mental, and physical issues) were analyzed using cultural consensus analysis. These 3 variables were salient factors in Ss' similarity judgments of the practitioners. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Ss were then assigned to either Martin self-talk (MST) or paper patch (PPT) mental practice technique groups or to a no-treatment control (CTL) group. Following 4 wks using the assigned technique, a 2nd performance assessment revealed that PPT Ss showed significant improvements over MST and CTL Ss, both in the group design and when multiple comparisons were made across Ss. The importance of investigating the efficacies of different types of mental practice when applied to specific sporting or performance activities is emphasized.

AB - Provides a framework for understanding the developmental, occupational, pathologic, therapeutic, and research aspects of sport psychiatry. Studies in psychiatry, psychology, and psychoanalysis provide the basis for this overview, and nonscientific works are cited where they illuminate various issues. Illustrative case examples are also reported. It is proposed, but not proven, that athletes undergo phase-specific development and that they may suffer impairments in adapting to the athletic context. This context may also modify treatment modalities. Because of the close relationship of physical and mental phenomena in sports and because athletic behaviors are often precisely measureable, athletics may constitute a fruitful area for psychiatric research, especially in the areas of childhood trauma, competition, and mental illness.

Physical activity is a positive causal effect on self-esteem that can beneficially affect hypertension, osteoporosis, adult-onset diabetes, and some psychiatric disorders. It is as effective as different forms of psychotherapy on depressed patient. Individual psychological benefits of physical activity include reduced state anxiety, decreased level of mild to moderate depression, reductions in neuroticism and anxiety, reduction of various stress indices, an adjunct to the professional treatment of severe depression, and beneficial emotional effects across ages and genders.

Additionally, participation in exercise and sport can result in increased benefits such as enhanced self-esteem, self-reliance, and willingness to take risks. While a review of the literature revealed no articles of performance enhancement techniques for the mentally retarded, other research findings on psychological skills training are applicable. Extensive suggestions on working with athletes with MR are offered. Due to the cognitive limitations characteristic of persons with MR, challenges faced by the sport psychologist in providing sport psychology services include the difficulty in assessing behavioral changes. A case study of a 28-yr-old mildly retarded female swimmer illustrates some challenges and rewards in working with athletes with MR. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Reasons range from performance enhancement (anabolic steroids) to relieving stress and boredom (so-called recreational drugs). Drug testing, strict policies and enforcement, and educational programs have continued to be the main responses to the problem. However, relatively little attention has been given to preventive rather than punitive and curative strategies, particularly with respect to the coach's input. Cognitive and behavioral approaches are described for coaches and sport psychology consultants in dealing with drug abuse among athletes. Recommendations, based on personal interactions with intercollegiate athletes, include teaching coping skills, building self-esteem through skill development, and structuring the athlete's free time.

In Exp 1, 18 senior elite wrestlers were studied; in Exp 2, 33 junior elite wrestlers were examined. The PST program was effective in changing Ss' knowledge, perceptions of importance, and use of 4 skills: relaxation, visualization/imagery, goal setting, and mental preparation. Multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVAs) revealed that the relaxation and visualization segments were particularly effective. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

There was a significant increase in muscular activity during mental imagery across all Ss, but the difference between the high and low skilled groups was not significant. This lack of difference may suggest that the differential effects of imagery based on skill level are not due to the neuromuscular activation during imagery.

Ss were assigned to 1 of 3 mental preparation strategies: a self-generated arousal strategy, a prescribed arousal strategy, or a placebo-control strategy. Results support the utility of different mental preparation strategies for increasing strength performance, but not RT-decision performance, for Ss with moderate and high levels of previous competitive experience. Self-generated arousal strategies enhanced performance of moderately experienced Ss. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

The contribution is described in 4 phases that provide a framework for the role of a sport psychology consultant: (a) establishing a rapport with the athlete, (b) formulating a psychological profile, (c) evaluating the demands of the athletic pursuit and planning an appropriate mental training program, and (d) ongoing evaluation of progress and crisis intervention. The psychological profile was developed through the use of instruments such as the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire (16PF). The consultant helped to formulate responses to 3 problems the athlete anticipated: excessive heat, mental strategies, and cumulative exhaustion.

Findings reveal that 81% of the Ss considered mental preparation to be very important or extremely important in preparing for competition; only 2% considered it to be unimportant. A significant difference was demonstrated between teams from various countries in the use of visualization/imagery and frequency of dreams about play (Canada made most frequent use). There was also a significant difference in the frequency of mental training received from a trained sport psychologist. The team that had the most frequent contact with a trained sport psychologist (Australia) was the most successful team at the tournament. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Yet the concept of peak performance is not limited to athletics. . . . It is my hope that this book will chart a path to peak performance within virtually any discipline of mind or body. I have developed in these writings a firm conceptual foundation for the Theory of Right Practice. This foundation consists of a scientific and philosophical inquiry into the nature of the human mind. "Mental Discpline: The Pursuit of Peak Performance" explores the scientific disciplines of exercise physiology, neurophysiology, and quantum physics, together with the Eastern disciplines of meditative introspection, to develop a model of human consciousness that is grounded in the extraordinary power of the individual will. It is the mastery of the willpower of the mind that provides the indispensable foundation for right practice. I offer "Mental Discipline: The Pursuit of Peak Performance" as a guidebook on the path to a mastery of the will. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(preface)

AB - 101 intercollegiate wrestling coaches completed a survey concerning the importance of, use of, frequency of problems arising with, and degree of success experienced in changing or developing 21 psychological skills. Mental toughness, positive attitude, individual motivation, and attention-concentration were judged to be most important for success in wrestling. Anxiety-stress control, attention-concentration, lack of confidence, and mental toughness were reported as areas in which wrestlers frequently experienced problems. Strategies most easily developed were goal setting, team cohesion, and mental practice-imagery. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Assessed psychological skills relevant to exceptional athletic performance, using questionnaire data collected from 713 male and female athletes from 23 sports. The athlete sample comprised 126 elite competitors, 141 preelite athletes, and 446 nonelite collegiate athletes (mean ages 24.1, 18.6, and 19.8 yrs, respectively). 16 sport psychologists also completed the questionnaire as they thought the ideal athlete might. Analyses revealed significant differences among the athlete subsamples: concentration, anxiety management, self-confidence, mental preparation, and motivation were seen to have potential importance in skill-level differentiation. The ideal profile constructed by the sport psychologists generally paralleled the skill differences encountered, although the elite athletes did not report selected amplitudes in the profile.

AB - 36 experienced weight lifters (aged 17–34 yrs) executed a weight-lifting task under each of 4 mental preparation conditions (self-efficacy, attentional focus, imagery, and preparatory arousal) and 2 control conditions. Results indicate that Ss performed significantly better when allowed to engage in mental preparation than when engaging in cognitive distraction. The preparatory arousal condition was associated with significant improvement in performance over the control conditions and was significantly more effective than the other 3 psyching strategies. Findings suggest that preparatory arousal cognitive preparation strategies (possibly in conjunction with other strategies) may be the most effective in facilitating maximum performance in experienced athletes executing a weight-lifting task.

The 4 phases of the program are sport analysis, individual assessment, conceptualization/motivation, and mental skill development. The sport analysis phase involves analyzing the unique characteristics and demands of a particular activity or sport. The individual assessment phase entails establishing an individual profile of the athlete's strengths and weaknesses. The conceptual/motivational phase provides information on the athlete/athletic situation interaction, the kind of commitment needed to change inappropriate behaviors, and the importance of establishing an efficient goal-setting strategy. The final phase focuses on the development of general and specific mental skills. Sources and examples of data-gathering techniques, questionnaires, and mental skill enhancement strategies are described. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Trained 10 marathon runners in the use of associative thinking based on precise and directive thought processes found with superior marathoners at high training intensities. The mental strategy training program was devised to allow the Ss to adopt task-oriented thinking during endurance training to increase aerobic conditioning yet minimize risk of overuse injuries. Light-weight, two-way radios enabled hands-free communication between trainers and runners during the 5-wk period. To monitor progress, tape transcriptions of the 1st, 3rd, and 5th training sessions were analyzed for content according to a 10-category subclassification system incorporating an association/dissociation distinction and attentional foci. Ratings were obtained for perceived exertion. Results show a convergence of increased proportion of associative thinking with an increase in perceived training effort.

AB - Coaches and athletes alike acknowledge that the outcome of sporting events does not necessarily favor the most skilled athletes - but it favors those that are mentally toughest on a given day. Yet, in spite of this fact, most athletes spend 90 to 95% of their time on the development of physical skills and very little time on the development of mental factors that lead to athletic success. There are many excellent books available on the topic of mental training but they have one major weakness - the material is too difficult and/or too time consuming to properly implement in a successful format. Therefore, I wrote this book based on the Mental Conditioning Program that I have used with athletes for the past 15 years. The Mindset for Winning follows the same program used successfully by hundreds of athletes, from the high school level to the professional ranks, from weekend athletes to full-time athletes. As you read through and follow the program, you too will find success as you use the powers of the mind to supplement and complement your physical training methods.

AB - Describes common problems found in working with athletes, including alcohol and drug abuse, physical aggression (developing controls that allow expression of aggression in the athletic arena but not in other domains of life), identity issues, relationship issues, and stress and burnout. The forms of identity issues for athletes include general identity issues (problems when the athlete can no longer successfully participate and existential crises), issues of homosexuality/bisexuality, latent homosexuality, eternal adolescent views and behaviors, and negative identity. Relationship issues discussed include (1) difficulty maintaining a relationship in the face of the amounts of time that may need to be spent in training and competition, (2) the amount of the athlete's life and the family's life that can become centered around the sport, and (3) infidelity. It is concluded that working with athletes presents special challenges in terms of understanding the development and meaning of athletics to an individual.

AB - Investigated the relationship between associative thinking and perception of training intensity among marathon runners, using light-weight microcassette recorders to document the verbalized thought processes of 12 novice, 10 average, and 9 superior marathoners during training runs. 10 theme categories incorporating the broad association/dissociation classification, as well as attentional style foci, were developed to analyze the mental strategy recordings for content. Results show a direct relationship between associative mental strategy and perception of effort regardless of the running status of the athlete. Findings reveal distinct qualitative differences within the associative thought categories across the 3 groups. It is suggested that a mental strategy training program to optimize the runner's performance output without the risk of injury at high effort would be feasible.

Participants included 51 women and 16 men between the ages of 19 and 55 yrs. Results of questionnaire data indicate that general attitudes toward sports were positive with regard to their contribution to health, relaxation and wellbeing, and social experience. General attitudes were neutral with regard to esthetic experience and negative with regard to achievement and competition and thrill and risk-taking. Reasons for preferring one's own sport included promotion of health and fitness, enhancement of physical attractiveness, and promotion of a sense of achievement. There was no relationship between general attitudes toward sports and personal preferences for a particular sport. The positive changes in perceived wellbeing after engaging in a sport demonstrated only a small relationship to expressed reasons for preferring a particular sport and no relationship to general attitudes toward sports.

Galliwey's (1974) inner-game approach to coaching sports skills. Exp I made a direct comparison of the relative efficiency of the inner-game and traditional methodologies for coaching badminton. Results suggest that the inner-game approach was superior. Ss coached with the inner-game approach recorded more wins than Ss coached with the traditional approach in a round-robin badminton tournament conducted after 8 wks of coaching. Since imagery is of central importance in the inner-game approach, Exp II compared 3 types of imagery for coaching a tennis serve. These were inner-game imagery, in which the flight path was emphasized; target imagery, in which the target was emphasized; and blocked target imagery, which is similar to target imagery but practiced in blocks of 5 trials. Ss were divided into 3 groups based on type of imagery used in coaching, and a control group was also included. Results again suggest the superiority of the inner-game approach, based on results from a test of serving ability conducted after 4 weekly coaching sessions.

Psychometrics concerns itself with the differences that exist between individuals with respect to acquisition of skills and ability to execute particular tasks, and psychotherapy is involved in the implementation of efficient techniques of behavioral intervention. Issues of selectivity and performance are discussed, and therapeutic methods for intervening in problems affecting performance are described. These methods include autogenic training, progressive relaxation, biofeedback, systematic desensitization, positive reinforcement, and cognitive-oriented therapies. It is concluded that the clinical psychologist has a valuable role in sport. Psychodiagnostic procedures should be implemented wherever possible to identify the potential problem athlete and to enhance the prediction of athletic success.

AB - Physical activity is important for personality development and for maintaining physical fitness in old age. Many phenomena, which have so far been thought to be due to natural consequences of the aging process, can now be traced back to lack of physical activity. These findings are illustrated by examples referring to the most important subsystems (e.g., the CNS). To keep these subsystems and the entire body functioning well, specific adaptability must be improved through sports and exercise. Sports and exercise for the elderly should adequately improve coordinative skills, the ability of the muscles to relax, joint flexibility, muscle strength, endurance, vegetative adaptability, stress tolerance, control of body weight, and resistance to infections. Training plans for the elderly should include a wide range of abilities and skills and as great a variety of activities as possible. In this way, physical activity will be most efficient as a means of prophylaxis against premature deterioration of motor performance in old age; it will maintain motor mobility, which enables one to lead an independent life.

These recommendations are based on the interpretation that will is the newly created behavioral energy from the primitive energy that originates in the brain stem and limbic cortex. One should therefore (1) present the hindrances that are expected in actual competitive situations (model training), (2) increase the difficulty of hindrances progressively, (3) have clear subgoals in relation to ultimate goals and concentrate on striving for them persistently, (4) establish the attitudes of initiative and self-reliance through the experience of overcoming different levels of hindrances, and (5) take part in group activities and respect the rules of the group.

AB - A longstanding research question in the sport psychology literature has been whether a given amount of mental practice prior to performing a motor skill will enhance one's subsequent performance. The literature, however, has not provided any clear-cut answers to this question, and this has prompted the present, more comprehensive review of existing research using the meta-analytic strategy proposed by G. V. Glass (1977). From the 60 studies yielding 146 effect sizes, the overall average effect size was .48, which suggests that mentally practicing a motor skill influences performance only somewhat better than no practice at all. Effect sizes were also compared on a number of variables thought to moderate the effects of mental practice. Results from these comparisons indicate that studies using cognitive tasks had larger average effect sizes than motor or strength tasks and that published studies had larger average effect sizes than unpublished studies. These findings are discussed in relation to several existing explanations for mental practice, and 4 theoretical propositions are advanced.

AB - 55 college football players were categorized by race (Black, White), position (offensive lineman, offensive back, wide receiver, linebacker, defensive lineman, defensive back), and classification (freshman, sophomore, junior, senior). Each S completed a battery of psychological tests comprised of the Profile of Mood States (POMS), the California F-Scale of Authoritarianism, a locus of control (LOC) scale, and an ad hoc test on attitudes about mental determinants of athletic competition. Statistical comparisons showed that White Ss scored higher on the vigor dimension of the POMS, Black seniors tended to be more authoritarian than White seniors, and Blacks were more likely to be external and chance oriented on the LOC than Whites. It was also shown that Black Ss attributed less significance to the mental aspects of athletic competition than did Whites. Blacks more than Whites believed that physical rather than mental factors dictate success in athletic competition; this finding was consistent with Black Ss' predilections toward external chance perceptions of causality. Blacks were seen as more likely than Whites to ignore internal emotional and motivational referents and deal with competitive situations in isolation.

AB - Hypothesized that athletic activity would attenuate some of the psychoneurotic personality traits of paraplegics. The Middlesex Hospital Questionnaire (MHQ) was administered to 22 athletic and 19 nonathletic paraplegics (aged 13–49 yrs). Results were compared with the results from E. Baldo et al (1980), who administered the MHQ to 1,174 normal athletes, and results from D. C. Colucci and F. Mundo (1977), who administered the MHQ to 121 normal university students. Findings suggest that sport therapy does attenuate the psychoneurotic personality traits of anxiety, phobia, obsession, somatization, and depression in rehabilitated paraplegics. The slight attenuation of obsession reflects an unconscious conflict associated with being an invalid.

It is suggested that just as physical differences like strength and lung capacity are exercised, so too can individual psychological differences such as self-esteem and anxiety be manipulated to improve performance. The effects of specific individual differences on athletic performance and techniques for developing them are examined. Research supporting the effectiveness of these techniques is cited. A 7-step program of mental fitness designed to improve athletic performance is also presented.

The questionnaires were sent to 8 psychologists with extensive experience in sports to explore their attitudes with respect to 15 areas of concern for the clinician. Significant differences were evident in Ss' roles and techniques and in the instruments they employed in consulting. There was strong consensus as to the specific training that should be required of psychologists to enable them to work effectively with high-level competitors. An unexpected finding was the high value placed on the clinician's past experience as an athlete. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Nursing-home residents have frequently been characterized as unoccupied and disengaged. At the outset of the present study of a 100-resident institution, most residents were to be found in their own rooms, not exhibiting gross motor behavior or social interaction, and not participating in appropriate activities. To modify residents' levels of participation with the environment, a manipulative area was provided in the lounge. Participation in the lounge averaged 20% on days when the activity was not available, but increased to a mean of 74% on days when equipment and materials were given and residents were prompted to participate. When prompts were withdrawn and materials were available only by request, mean participation fell to 25%. The findings demonstrate that manipulative activities can support a high level of participation with the environment, if residents are prompted to use equipment and materials.

Rest consisted largely of reading and conversation, and the performance was of the Raven Advanced Progressive Matrices. The air and mean radiant temperatures were 23.C. Analysis of variance showed no difference between subjective assessments in rest and performance periods. The hypothesis is therefore not supported, and it is thus possible to apply comfort data obtained from resting Ss to people engaged in intellectual activity.

AB - Interviewed the parents of 128 graduates of 2 sheltered workshops for the retarded in Israel about the leisure time and social problems of their sons and daughters. The parents claimed that the most important problem was lack of suitable companions and friends of both sexes, and as a result the young adults spent their leisure time within the family and engaged in activities which do not require interaction with "normal" society. Present social facilities catering to the mentally retarded were judged to be inadequate, and there is very little social contact with members of the opposite sex. It appears that socially, the mentally retarded are isolated from the community. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Of 43 residents (mean age = 62 yrs) in a hospital geriatric ward for regressed and disabled persons, only 3 were found to engage in some purposeful daily activity; the rest were relatively inactive. Under a regimen of programed activities (e.g., bingo games) for 1 hr each afternoon, the daily average number of residents engaged in purposeful behavior rose to 13, but dropped to 3 again when the daily activities were discontinued. The program generated considerable staff enthusiasm and increased the likelihood of the use of similar activity programs on other hospital wards.

Results of open ended questionnaires indicate that group activities were the most therapeutic treatment modality and the most valuable use of unstructured time. The staff felt that improved relationships with others determined patient improvement, and, in addition, the distinction between "solitude" and "withdrawal" was not realized. Although the need to foster independence in preparing a patient's return to the community was indicated, the need for preparation in positive and creative utilization of time spent alone was not indicated. This was felt to be essential in promoting the successful return of a patient to a less structured and often solitary living situation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Examined the psychological consequences of sports involvement among adults. The theoretical expectation of a positive relationship between such involvement and psychological well-being was generally supported by the data. The relationship between behavioral involvement and psychological well-being was stronger for females, whereas emotional involvement was a stronger predictor of positive affect among males. The salutary consequences of social interaction with other people may contribute to psychological well-being, and participation in sports is an important means of achieving such interaction. In addition, psychological well-being is likely to result from the intrinsic pleasure and fun that flow from sports. (17 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Tests included 3 measures of emotional stability; 9 measures of the value and intensity of the dominant emotional state; 8 measures of the strength, equilibrium, and mobility of the nervous system; and 5 measures of individual differences in the mental control of behavior. Analysis of the intercorrelations led to the conclusion that the emotional stability of all 3 teams could be described in terms of the value and intensity of the emotions that accompany activity. Predominance of positive, intense emotions characterized the better athletes. The other indices showed different relationships with emotional stablity in the 3 groups of Ss. In the most highly qualified athletes the dominant determinant of emotional stability was the parameter of the mental control of activity. In athletes of lower qualification certain properties of the central nervous system, especially the strength of excitatory processes, appeared to be the principal determinants of emotional stablity.

Errors, successful solutions, rate of performance, handwriting changes, GSR, EKG, and observations of emotional behavior changes, changes in vocalization, and such autonomic changes as sweating were recorded. Individual differences and differences between sportsmen and nonsportsmen were noted. Results show that the most useful measures of performance under stress were handwriting changes, changes in verbalizing one's mental activity, and the degree of participation in a group effort.

Body image and self-concept assessments were made before and after the 8-wk program and 4 mo after the camp program ended. Ss were grouped for statistical purposes by maturation level, degree of overweight, ordinality, religion, parental status, and parental obesity. Body image showed significant positive change as a result of the camp program, but self-concept remained unchanged. The long-term trend of normal weight gain appeared to be interrupted. Weight lost as a result of the program was not regained after the camp period ended. It is concluded that longer follow-up periods would assist in the examination of the long-term effect of the camp program. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Results of the drawing test were compared with those from 2 other groups, 39 sportsmen and 750 persons from the general population. According to these analyses, very few Ss in the winter bathing group could handle anxiety in a normal way. Compulsive mechanisms were common, schizoid and paranoid features exceptionally common.

AB - 10-12 adolescent boys, 12-25 yr. old, from an outpatient mental health clinic were subjected to about 1 yr. of meeting weekly for 2 hr. with 2 male counselors in which problem-solving designed to deal with interpersonal problems was presented to them. This was found to be effective, but inadequate therapy. Following 4 mo. of preparation 9 boys and 2 counselors left on a camping trip by canoe for 5 days. Ss were exposed to an environment which required a great degree of group work, and counselors redirected problems which arose between Ss back to the group. Nightly group sessions were held and while problems of the day were discussed, emphasis was put on how each might change his behavior. Benefits included exposure to a challenging but controlled environment, exposure to an adventurous atmosphere requiring team work, temporary removal from disturbing environment, prolonged exposure to adequate adult models, and increased time for counselor-boy relationships.

Values and life styles are discussed, and a retreat project involving 35 community women in 4 discussion groups on alternative life styles is described. The daily program for the groups, which reflected theoretical, influential, aesthetic, and social life styles, and the ways in which each group worked are explained. Life style counseling with mature women is said to bring clarification to clients who had been drifting from 1 involvement to another, and to provide a framework for alternatives for individuals with leisure time.

The basic daily living or work-play skills of human beings are identified and the proposal is made that professional personnel and hospital milieu can positively or negatively influence the patient's resumption of his occupational role. The demands of the consumer for quality health care are seen as forcing the occupational therapist into an evaluation of the quality of service provided and as such, the relationship between hospitalization and the deterioration of the patient's daily living skills is examined. Guidelines are presented for assessing this relationship. (15 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Ss were matched as closely as possible. 10 received 50 sessions of operant conditioning followed by 50 play therapy sessions, while the other 10 received the play therapy 1st. Pre- and postblind measures of mental development were used to measure changes in cognitive development. The major deficit was found in the hearing-speech functions. The overall treatment program raised test scores a significant amount, and operant conditioning alone raised test scores significantly, but the positive change was not significant for the play therapy group alone. Over time the relative effectiveness of the operant conditioning was even more significant. Greatest improvement occurred in the area of language, and the possible etiology of the deficiencies in the syndrome is discussed. (30 ref.)

A group of 39 familial retarded children divided into developmental levels with mean MAs of 7, 8.8, and 11.8, respectively, were given a task on which performance reflects dependence upon adults and wariness of them. Ss, especially at younger MA levels, who received more visits and went on more vacations were found to be more independent and less wary. Results also indicate that it may be possible to predict from preinstitutional social histories which children are likely to be visited and be taken on vacations.

AB - Describes "an unusual and encouraging approach to the treatment of emotionally disturbed boys." A survey based on the case histories of 50 8-14 yr. old boys enrolled in the Dallas Salesmanship Club Boys Camp for an average of 16 mo. is reported. The 840-acre wooded camp area includes a lake for swimming and boating, and campers live in tents which they design and build. The boys, accepted on the basis of need, have been unable to receive help from other available treatment programs, including psychiatric hospitalization and outpatient psychotherapy. Adequate adjustment for life is the goal for each camper, and it is estimated that 70% make satisfactory adjustment during the postcamp period. Although no formal education is attempted during the camp experience, the boys "learn from source material in the experience curriculum." Follow-up studies indicate that the majority successfully reenter school at their appropriate age-grade level. "Although developed outside traditional psychiatric concepts," the camp offers an opportunity for psychiatrists and health workers to reappraise methods of dealing with the emotional problems of children and adolescents.

The purpose of the camps was to provide intensive reeducation and to contribute to the diagnosis of the problems. Daily records and ratings of Ss' conduct were kept. A modified form of psychodrama and group therapy was used. A relationship was found between Ss' conduct and the time of day and length of stay in the camp. Ss tried hard to attain socially desirable estimations from their leaders. A sociometric test revealed an analogue between characteristics of "stars" in the normal population and the sample of behavior disordered boys. The forms of psychotherapy utilized enabled the determination of the Ss' perceptions of educational procedures and of their parents. The diagnostic possibilities provided by this setting are discussed. (Russian summary) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Defines adapted physical education as a diversified program, adapted and changed to fit the abilities, problems, and physical limitation of the student or client. Therapeutic recreation refers to a broad spectrum of physical and social activities which facilitate an active involvement by participants in something pleasurable. At a simple level by participating in such programs, an individual can become more physically fit in order to develop hobbies, to become more active, to learn leisure time skills, and to undergo positive social and group experiences. On a deeper level, he can realize self-identification, overcome self-consciousness, develop self-confidence, express emotions naturally, respond to successes and failures, develop a better self-concept, and have the opportunity for self-evaluation along with self-satisfaction. Recreational services within rehabilitation are serving therapeutic purposes. A concentrated effort must be made to develop an awareness and a direction to structure recreation within rehabilitation to its full therapeutic potential. 5 suggested directions are made in order to implement the initiation of a recreational program.

AB - Psychosocial and vegetative-functional factors account for 50% of all work absences in the United States and West Germany. A large percentage of patients going to spas suffer from neuroses or psychosomatic troubles. The average patient in a spa expects to be cured from his troubles with as little effort as possible through baths, massages, medicines, etc.. It is felt that to get and stay well, a man must add his own efforts. Verbal recommendations are not enough. For a successful behavior therapy, the therapist must direct his patients to new activities. 4 forms of therapeutic activity, with a gradually increasing effort of application, are recommended: play, exercise, work, and fighting. Fighting, as a maximum form of action, demands the engagement of the entire personality, including personal risks. It expresses a special type of directed behavior therapy and includes voluntary assumed responsibilities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Called for an extensive study of the implications of increased leisure time. A problem for the psychotherapist would be in attempting to determine what each individual really wants to do with his life. "Factoralizing" each person's psychologic profile which would then be matched with a list of existing and/or potential activities is proposed. Social values and pressures would be subject to change. It is suggested that psychiatrists "gear" themselves to this changing society in order that they will be able to help their patients adjust to increased leisure time.

AB - In 2 bullfighter cases it was found that the artistic creation in bullfighting was a relief of the intolerable tensions from the fear of death or the aggression toward a feared object with which the artist must be reconciled. Contact with the brave bulls develops the bullfighter. Bullfighting may be the result of a negative Oedipus complex in the Spanish-speaking countries. There is an attempt to overcome this conflict through the omnipotent control over the fear of death and over the father who abandons his home very early in his son's life. (15 ref.)

AB - Analyzes 457 cases of admissions of tourists to the Innsbruck clinic. The majority were Germans visiting the Tyrol; however, there were patients admitted from 37 countries. Acute and chronic schizophrenia were the most common presenting complaints, followed by alcoholic intoxication, and complications of attempted suicide. Drug abuse was frequent in the young members and alcoholic intoxication in older members of tourist parties. It is suggested that most of the wide-ranging complaints probably had existed earlier but had become pathogenic during a holiday atmosphere and unaccustomed conditions of life and climate. Social problems and cooperation of health services in the care of increasing numbers of foreign patients are discussed. (35 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Discusses some of the issues involved in the professionalization of the adjunctive therapies, the nature of work and play, and the relationship of the adjunctive therapies to the concepts of community mental health. It is suggested that a congruence exists between the therapeutic potentials intrinsic in adjunctive therapy activities and a conceptual model inherent in community mental health programs, I.e., that all human behavior is socially noted. Thus, the social system model proposed involves in reinterpretation of the therapeutic value of the adjunctive therapies and emphasizes the inherent therapeutic values of the recreational and play dimensions of the adjunctive therapies. It is suggested that activities in these therapies be directed to restore "humanness, awareness, individuality, and meaning." (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Results indicate that the conduct disorder child can achieve greater satisfaction in a recreation setting if the setting is structurally conducive to the control of his deviant behavior. The traditional models of free play and socially centered programing were tried but failed. They could only be effectively utilized once the requisite social, physical, and behavioral skills had been acquired in a structured setting. The program's staff, structure, and content as well as certain leadership principles which emerged throughout the yr. are described. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Clarified the individual and general structure of play therapy and the relationship between the therapy process and its results. 3 cases were studied and diagnosed: Case I, a 7-yr-old hyperactive, acting out female with abnormal EEG; Case II, a 7-yr-old immature male with personality disorder; and Case III, a 6-yr-old regressive female with personality disorder. 30-item check lists and diagrams were used to study results and each therapy process was recorded on its own check list. Results show that: (a) after 38 sessions in 5 stages, Case I reached a stage of independence and insight; (b) after 60 sessions in 6 stages, Case II achieved stabilization of the relationship; (c) after 42 sessions in 6 stages, Case III was at the stage of accepting approach. It is concluded that the approach-avoidance conflict or ambivalence, in all 3 cases, served as an index to understanding the dynamics of the case and the S's basic problem.

Deprivation in nursing homes was found to be related to lack of stimulation, adequate walking space inside and outside, recreational and occupational therapy, space for group socialization and activities, and a common dining room. Also related were the absence of volunteer workers, separation of Ss on different floors, and minimal socialization between male and female patients. Case reports exemplifying deprivation reactions and regressive behavior are presented. Proposed programs for overcoming these problems are discussed.

The program design included: (a) a passive activity program, (b) more active recreational programs, (c) formalized instruction for semi-independent living skills, and (d) training to develop responsibility. As a result of the program, 27 patients were returned to their home communities where they function semi-independently, and the remainder showed positive growth in responsibility, independence, and new-found direction in life. It is suggested that the program may be generalized to other than mentally retarded populations, and that it bears implications for geriatric facilities, mental hospitals, and private nursing homes.

AB - The elephant joke cycle exists as a cultural phenomenon at a specific point in time and space. It can be explained as an outlet for the reenactment and control of oedipal problems. The Negro freedom movement is the catalytic agent producing such a regressive response. The elephant may be both the adult sexual rival as opposed to the child and the Negro sexual rival as opposed to the white. If the killing of the elephant eliminates either the father or Negro or both, and if it accomplishes this harmlessly so that the killer need feel no guilt, then the function and significance of elephant jokes are clear. Such jokes are serious business. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Reanalyzed the data of J. R. Tilton and D. R. Ottinger (see 39:3) using a multiple discriminant function analysis, which allowed consideration of all 10 categories of toy play and their intercorrelations. Significant differences (p < .001) were found among the 3 groups and between the possible pairs of groups (normal-autistic, normal-retarded, autistic-retarded). In the 4 discriminant function analyses, the proportions of Ss statistically classified the same as their original psychiatric diagnosis were .96 of the normals, .83 of the autistics, and .89 of the retardates. The combinational category of toy play emerged as the most important variable in discriminating the groups. It is concluded that this observational technique combined with the multiple discriminant function analysis would have practical utility as a diagnostic and evaluative measurement instrument.

Success was attributed to the ritualistic formality of these dances which was seen to be appealing to schizophrenic patients. (English summary) (29 ref.)

AB - 60 alcoholics beyond the acute withdrawal phase, spent 6 wk. in a continuing care unit where they participated in 1 of 2 programs. Program A consisted of regular psychiatrically-oriented treatment, with a well-balanced, well-structured program including didactic lectures, films, community meetings, occupational therapy, group psychotherapy, and recreational activity. Program B discontinued formal aspects, and Ss were encouraged to use occupational and recreational facilities with the responsibility for seeking help placed on the S. Results showed 28% of the psychological treatment group improved, and 31% of the recreational group improved. It is concluded that in dealing with this particular type of patient, a treatment program emphasizing recreation is at least as effective and in fact may be even more effective, than a program geared toward establishing psychological insights.

Success was checked at the time of release and 72 parents of a cross-section of the Ss were sent a questionnaire. Of 64 responses 50% reported no symptoms in their children, 23.4% as improved, and 26.6% no success. At the ages 8-15, treatment produced significantly better results than in the 5-7 yr. group. More bed-wetters came from families of workers, and those with 4 or more children. In disharmonic or broken families there were more relapses. Other difficulties (mostly organic) also caused relapse.

The current author fails to see any relationship between Stollak's hypothesis, his method, his results, and his conclusion. Stollak presents no data which indicate any therapeutic effect the students may have had on the children. The evaluation of experimental studies require an application of criteria, namely how well the hypothesis, the method, the results, and the conclusion represent each other or how "congruent" they are. It seems desirable to base the acceptance of submitted experimental papers for publication in this journal on the above illustrated criteria particularly in view of the fact that many psychologists read only the conclusions--or abstracts--and assume that the stated conclusions follow from the reported hypotheses, methods, and results.

AB - Assessed the value of camping as a treatment experience for nonhospitalized emotionally handicapped children. 22 Ss were divided into groups of 3 or 4 each with their own counselor, and a highly structured program was developed which gave the Ss little time for free play. Ss were evaluated by means of (1) a psychiatric assessment before and after camp; (2) questionnaires completed by each S's teacher, parents, and by each S before and after camp; (3) a daily written report of each S; and (4) records of daily staff conferences. It was found that all parents agreed that their child's behavior had improved on return from camp; all teachers reported varying degrees of improvement in the child's social adjustment to school; all staff members regarded the experience as useful to themselves in terms of their future career; and the mental health team felt that they achieved a more rapid rate of progress in their treatment of both parents and child.

AB - 38 11-year-old boys were tested in throwing. They were naive to a 2nd throwing skill in which they were subsequently given instruction, and mentally, but not physically, practiced this skill during 9 daily practice periods, each of 5 minutes duration. They were subsequently tested in their performance of the skills they had been mentally practicing. The "games ability" of each member of the group was calculated from subjective assessments of his performances at 4 games. The boys were then placed in rank order and the ranking subdivided into high, average, and low "games ability" groups. It was found that only the high "games ability" group made statistically significant improvement over the period of the practice and that the greatest gain occurred within this group with the boys who scored least in the original throwing test. Thus it appeared that 2 factors could have contributed to the results, "games ability" or motivation caused by a necessity to maintain a games reputation.

Satisfaction was expressed over the increasing popularization of research for the public in this field of adolescent psychology, and a plea was made for the use of more of the newer research techniques.

AB - Food, clothing and shelter have, from time immemorial, been recognized as the essential factors in living. Recently the list has been enlarged to include amusement. This is doubtless due to the fact that it is now well known that the thought and emotional life of a person without amusement is too circumscribed. The result is that without play the daily life becomes a grind, lacking inspiration, free play of the imagination, a more sympathetic attitude towards life, and a mental and physical agility that make for understanding and tolerance. All in all, the person without amusement and recreation is, both in his work and in his leisure, a person who thinks in too straight a line. The facts outside of his daily routine that should direct and modify the course of his vocational mental activity pass unnoticed unless amusement enters in to interrupt his usual trend of thought and leaves him free to take in, momentarily at least, what passes around him. He fails entirely to enrich that thought that has to do with his vocation. The last generation in its youth was reacting normally to the repression and "play is waste" idea of the preceding generation. In time, perhaps in another generation or so, a more healthful balance will be established through the intelligent understanding of the respective values of work and play. Everywhere in the world today all forms of amusement have a particularly strong physical appeal and a very simple thought and emotion content. After visiting places of amusement of high and low order in all parts of the world I am convinced that we are doing ourselves a great injustice by vulgarizing our emotions and stultifying our thoughts by the type of pleasures we now condone. In looking at the stage as a whole, and by this I include the legitimate drama, the vaudeville and moving picture shows, we see everywhere that, while the productions improve marvelously in artistic setting, the plays themselves show marked deterioration. The fact is, that the theaters of the Orient are changing very rapidly, a theatrical Europeanization and foreignizing is taking place. The taking of alcohol in the form of beer, wine and whisky is probably one of the most common forms of amusement in the world today. This is because of the immediate action that produces a pleasant feeling of exhilaration and excitement, and that is an instigator and stimulator to other amusements. From a political point of view the English have taken possession of the world. The same is true of the world of amusement; sport is the great avocation of the world today, and a very healthful avocation it is for both young and old, provided each person participates himself, thereby deriving physical and mental refreshment from it. When viewed as a whole, the subject of amusement becomes increasingly important from the fact that more time and money are constantly being spent in its pursuit.

AB - Our conception of experimentation includes a large number of phenomena having the common tendency to bring into action the manifold inborn predispositions of the organism, but without reference to those instincts by means of which the relation of the individual to other living creatures is regulated. In experimentation only the more general needs, such as are indubitably grounded in the nature of the organism, are allowed expression, in such a manner as to bring into action the sensor and motor apparatus as well as the higher mental faculties. The individual would exhibit similar qualities in isolation; he plays with himself, not with his relations to others, and even when association exists, as, for instance, in ball-catching, he recognises at the same time that experimental play is involved. Now, however, we enter on the consideration of such play as is intentionally directed toward other beings, and first on our list is the inborn impulse to fight. In order to discriminate as to the relative importance of the various fighting plays the following division of the subject will prove convenient: First, there are direct fighting plays in which the contestants immediately measure their strength, whether mental or physical. The second group is composed of indirect fighting plays where the victory is sought through means of conducting the contest. Among the mental phases of this we find betting and gambling. In the third group we place merely offensive sports in which no defence is possible or availing, such as playful destructiveness, teasing, and the enjoyment of the comic (so far as it is connected with fighting at all). After disposing of all these, two subdivisions yet remain: first, playful chasing, fleeing, and hiding (hunting plays); and, second, the enjoyment of witnessing a contest.

AB - Objectives: Research to date has identified a range of factors suggested to facilitate flow states in sport. However, less attention has focused on how exactly those facilitating factors influence the occurrence of flow. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the specific ways in which such facilitators influenced flow occurrence in European Tour golfers. Design: Qualitative design. Method: Ten full-time golfers from the European Tour ( M age = 37; SD = 13.08) participated in semi-structured interviews investigating the occurrence of their flow states. Data were interpreted using an iterative process of thematic and connecting analyses. Results: Ten facilitators of flow were identified, of which commitment and the caddie have not been reported previously. Twenty four connecting links were identified in the data, through which the caddie, effective preparation, and high-quality performance appeared to be most influential for flow occurrence. Confidence and concentration also emerged as key constructs underlying the flow experience in this setting. Conclusion: A central contribution of this study is the identification of ways in which facilitating factors could influence flow occurrence in elite golf. This process adds detail to understanding of flow occurrence, and moves beyond simply identifying factors which are associated with the experience. As such, connecting analysis is proposed as an additional strategy for qualitatively investigating flow occurrence in sport. Results are discussed in relation to previous literature, and recommendations are identified for researchers, athletes, coaches and practitioners.

AB - Compared with the large body of literature on coping, coping flexibility has received relatively scant research attention, although more such studies have begun to emerge recently. Researchers have conceptualized coping flexibility in diverse ways: as a broad coping repertoire, a well-balanced coping profile, cross-situational variability in strategy deployment, a good strategy–situation fit, or the perceived ability to cope with environmental changes. This meta-analysis is the first to provide a summary estimate of the overall effect size and investigate cross-study sources of variation in the beneficial role of coping flexibility. The analysis covers all available studies conducted between 1978 and 2013 that empirically tested the relationship between coping flexibility and psychological adjustment. The results of a random-effects model revealed a small to moderate overall mean effect size (r = .23, 95% CI [.19, .28], 80% CRI [–.02, .49], k = 329, N = 58,946). More important, the magnitude of the positive link between coping flexibility and psychological adjustment varied with the conceptualization of such flexibility. Studies adopting the perceived ability or strategy–situation fit conceptualization yielded moderate effect sizes, whereas those adopting the broad repertoire, balanced profile, or cross-situational variability conceptualization yielded small effect sizes. In addition, the positive link between coping flexibility and psychological adjustment was stronger in samples from countries lower (vs. higher) in individualism and samples with higher (vs. lower) average ages. Individualism and age explained 10% and 13% of the variance, respectively. We discuss the conceptual problems and implications and propose a synthesized conceptualization of coping flexibility.

AB - This study examined the psychological responses to injury in Australian Football League players. A prospective design was utilized to explore the psychological reactions to injuries of 8 football players throughout the rehabilitation period at 3 points. Qualitative interviews with these long-term injured players generated 14 themes across the 3 injury phases. These themes related to the emotional reactions to the injury, received support, the challenge of rehabilitation, and the psychological readiness to return to play. The findings have important implications regarding the management and preparation of Australian Football League players returning to competition in a state of physical and psychological health.

AB - The importance of psychological skills to an athlete is widely recognized. The Athletic Psychological Skills Inventory (APSI) was developed to evaluate psychological skills in the Taiwanese sports environment. This study employed the APSI model to refine the psychological skill factor structure. The model was supported as a reliable and valid form of measurement. A second-order confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) confirmed the factor structure of the APSI in Taiwanese collegiate athletes. Peaking under pressure and coping with adversity were combined into a simplified factor, coping with adversity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - Young competitive athletes are not miniature elite athletes; they are a distinct client group to whom sport psychology practitioners (SPPs) increasingly deliver services. Interventions with this client group are often undertaken by newly educated SPPs who are in need of good guiding principles. Yet, there is a lack of research informing SPPs’ work with this group. In this current study, semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted with four experienced practitioners about their most successful interventions in competitive youth sport. Analysis showed three major themes: (a) young athletes should be equipped with a holistic skills package that enables them to handle a number of existential challenges; (b) young athletes are embedded in an environment (coaches, experts, teammates etc.) that should be involved in the interventions; and (c) interventions with young athletes should maintain a long-term focus. These themes are discussed in the context of current literature on sport psychology service delivery. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

Specific suggestions are provided for athletes to use before, during, and after competition. Athletes are encouraged to accept and acknowledge pressure and the feelings associated with choking, as opposed to attempting to avoid or get rid of these feelings. The strategy for athletes to use during competition is to ACT on it, or to follow the steps of Accept, Center, and Trust.

AB - Psychological resilience is important in sport because athletes must utilise and optimise a range of mental qualities to withstand the pressures that they experience. In this article, we discuss psychological resilience in sport performers via a review of the stressors athletes encounter and the protective factors that help them withstand these demands. It is hoped that synthesising what is known in these areas will help researchers gain a deeper profundity of resilience in sport, and also provide a rigorous and robust foundation for the development of a sport-specific measure of resilience. With these points in mind, we divided the narrative into two main sections. In the first section, we review the different types of stressors encountered by sport performers under three main categories: competitive, organisational and personal. Based on our recent research examining psychological resilience in Olympics champions, in the second section we discuss the five main families of psychological factors (viz. positive personality, motivation, confidence, focus, perceived social support) that protect the best athletes from the potential negative effect of stressors. It is anticipated that this review will help sport psychology researchers examine the interplay between stressors and protective factors, which will, in turn, focus the analytical lens on the processes underlying psychological resilience in athletes.

AB - We investigated for the first time whether the principles of specificity could be extended to the psychological construct of anxiety and whether any benefits of practicing with anxiety are dependent on the amount of exposure and timing of that exposure in relation to where in learning the exposure occurs. In Experiment 1, novices practiced a discrete golf-putting task in one of four groups: all practice trials under anxiety (anxiety), non-anxiety (control), or a combination of these two (i.e., the first half of practice under anxiety before changing to non-anxiety conditions, anxiety-control, or the reverse of this, control-anxiety). Following acquisition, all groups were transferred to an anxiety condition. Results revealed a significant acquisition-to-transfer decrement in performance between acquisition and transfer for the control group only. In Experiment 2, novices practiced a complex rock climbing task in one of the four groups detailed above, before being transferred to both a high-anxiety condition and a low-anxiety condition (the ordering of these was counterbalanced across participants). Performance in anxiety transfer was greater following practice with anxiety compared to practice without anxiety. However, these benefits were influenced by the timing of anxiety exposure since performance was greatest when exposure to anxiety occurred in the latter half of acquisition. In the low-anxiety transfer test, performance was lowest for those who had practiced with anxiety only, thus providing support for the specificity of practice hypothesis. Results demonstrate that the specificity of learning principle can be extended to include the psychological construct of anxiety. Furthermore, the specificity advantage appears dependent on its timing in the learning process. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - In this study, we conducted a pretest-posttest investigation of a sports-oriented occupational therapy intervention using surfing in an experiential, skills-based program to support veterans with symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in their transition to civilian life. The purpose of this feasibility study was to evaluate the intervention for attendance rates and retention in the program provided in 5 sessions over 5 wk. Fourteen veterans from a specialty postdeployment clinic at a Veterans Affairs hospital were enrolled; 11 completed the study, and 10 attended ≥ 3 sessions. Participants reported clinically meaningful improvement in PTSD symptom severity (PTSD Checklist—Military Version, Wilcoxon signed rank Z = 2.5, p = .01) and in depressive symptoms (Major Depression Inventory, Wilcoxon signed rank Z = 2.05, p = .04). The results of this small, uncontrolled study suggest that a sports-oriented occupational therapy intervention has potential as a feasible adjunct intervention for veterans seeking mental health treatment for symptoms of PTSD.

AB - Objectives: Physical activity (PA) was found to influence human brain morphology. However, the impact of PA on brain morphology was mainly demonstrated in seniors. We investigated healthy individuals across a broad age range for the relation between habitual PA and brain morphology. Methods: Ninety-five participants (19 – 82 years) were assessed for self-reported habitual PA with the “Baecke habitual physical activity questionnaire”, and T1-weighted magnetic resonance images were evaluated with whole brain voxel based morphometry for gray and white matter volumes and densities. Results: Regression analyses revealed a positive relation between the extent of physical activity and gray matter volume bilaterally in the anterior hippocampal and parahippocampal gyrus independent of age and gender. Age as well as leisure and locomotion activities were linked to enhanced white matter volumes in the posterior cingulate gyrus and precuneus, suggesting a positive interaction especially in seniors. Conclusions: Habitual physical activity is associated with regional volumetric gray and white matter alterations. The positive relation of hippocampal volume and physical activity seems not to be restricted to seniors. Thus, habitual physical activity should be generally considered as an influencing factor in studies investigating medial temporal lobe volume and associated cognitive functions (memory), especially in psychiatric research.

AB - Background: Persons with intellectual disabilities (ID) constitute a special‐needs population at high risk of falling. This is the first study to evaluate whether obstacle course training can improve mobility and prevent falls in this population. Methods: The intervention was implemented as part of an institution‐wide health care improvement plan aimed at reducing falls at a residential facility for people with ID. It comprised an annual screening of each resident for his or her individual fall risk. Subsequently, the group of ambulatory persons with a moderate to high fall risk ( n = 39) were offered 10‐session obstacle course training to improve their balance and gait abilities. Mobility was assessed pre‐intervention, mid‐term and post‐intervention with the Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment (POMA), the Timed Up and Go (TUG) and the 10‐meter walking test. The number of falls was compared between the year before and after intervention. Results: The number of falls decreased by 82% ( P < 0.001). POMA scores significantly improved from pre‐intervention to mid‐term (mean difference ± SD, 1.8 ± 2.9, P = 0.001), from mid‐term to post‐intervention (2.0 ± 2.9, P < 0.001), and from pre‐intervention to post‐intervention (3.8 ± 4.3, P < 0.001). Participants completed the 10‐meter walking test faster at the post‐intervention compared with the pre‐intervention assessment (difference ± SD, 2.1 ± 5.1 s, P = 0.022). TUG scores did not improve significantly. Conclusions: The present study provides preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of obstacle course training in improving mobility and preventing falls in people with ID. As falls are a significant health concern in this population, further research is advocated to provide conclusive evidence for the suggested beneficial effects of exercise interventions.

AB - Participation in ultra-endurance events has increased in popularity in recent years. Many of these ultra-endurance events have used sport and exercise theory as an interventional tool to quantify the impact of the challenge. However, some challenges are unique, and include feats of incredible endurance in order to push the human body to its maximal limit. We describe a case study of a sport psychologist providing support to an athlete prior to, during and following the completion of a challenge that involved walking the same mile, 1,000 consecutive times during 1,000 consecutive hours, thereby lasting 42 days. We also review and detail the experiences gained from a sport psychology perspective with the intention of sharing the applied experience amongst other sport psychologists and the wider community.

AB - There have been many studies that have shown that waking life is mirrored in dream content. In a previous study, a relation between time spent on sports-related tasks and sport-related dreams has been found showing that sports students dream of sports more often than psychology students. In this study the aim was to test whether this trend is also true for students of politics and if the time spent in waking life on political topics is also directly reflected in their dream lives. 128 students of politics, psychology and others, as well as employed people, were asked to tell us about their dream lives and waking life activities with regard to politics, sports and music. As expected, there was a direct link between the amount of time spent with these waking life activities and the percentages of dreams related to politics and sports. The findings were thus in line with the continuity hypothesis and it was shown that the amount of time spent on political topics in waking life directly reflects the percentage of politically themed dreams.

AB - Background: The Healthy Hearing (HH) programme at the Special Olympics (SO) revealed hearing disorders in between 16 and 40% of athletes. However, it is not clear whether these prevalence represents the entire population with intellectual disability. Therefore, this study compares the hearing status of SO athletes with an intellectual disability (ID) to students with ID at a special needs school. Materials and Methods: The HH screening was performed in 637 athletes (mean age 27.1 years, range 9.7–70.6 years) during the 2008 German SO Summer Games—and in 198 special needs students (mean age 12.7 years, range 6.7–20.0 years). Results: Twenty‐two per cent of athletes and 18% of students failed the HH screening. Approximately 60% of the total participants received recommendations for further follow‐up and treatment without between‐group differences. Conclusions: The results of the HH screening at SO events are assumed to be representative of children and adolescents with ID in special needs schools.

AB - To determine potential benefits of intensive leisure sports for age-related changes in postural control, we tested 3 activity groups comprising 70 young ( M = 21.67 years, SD = 2.80) and 73 older ( M = 62.60 years, SD = 5.19) men. Activity groups were martial artists, who held at least 1st Dan (black belt), sportive individuals exercising sports without explicit balance components, and nonsportive controls. Martial artists had an advantage over sportive individuals in dynamic posture tasks (upright stance on a sway-referenced platform), and these 2 active groups showed better postural control than nonsportive participants. Age-related differences in postural control were larger in nonsportive men compared with the 2 active groups, who were similar in this respect. In contrast, negative age differences in other sensorimotor and cognitive functions did not differ between activity groups. We concluded that individuals engaging in intensive recreational sports have long-term advantages in postural control. However, even in older martial artists with years of practice in their sports, we observed considerable differences favoring the young.

AB - The overall purpose of this study was to examine individuals’ experiences of running an ultramarathon. Following pilot work data were collected with six people who entered the 2012 Canadian Death Race. Participants were interviewed before the race, took photographs and made video recordings during the race, wrote a summary of their experience, and attended a focus group after the race. The research team also interviewed participants during the race. Before the race participants had mixed emotions. During the race they experienced numerous stressors (i.e., cramping and injuries, gastrointestinal problems, and thoughts about quitting). They used coping strategies such as making small goals, engaging in a mental/physical battle, monitoring pace, nutrition, and hydration, and social support. After the race, nonfinishers experienced dejection or acceptance whereas finishers commented on the race as a major life experience. These findings provide some insights into factors involved in attempting to complete ultramarathons and offer some implications for applied sport psychology.

AB - The current work examined the superstitious behaviors of sport fans. A sample of 1661 college students completed a questionnaire packet assessing demographics, team identification, sport fandom, superstitions, perceptions of superstition impact and importance, and why they engaged in the superstitions. A total of 675 persons reported at least one superstition. Higher levels of sport fandom and higher levels of team identification correlated with a greater number of superstitions listed. Further, persons with higher levels of team identification reported greater perceptions of the impact and importance of their superstitions. The categorization of the superstitions revealed that apparel superstitions were most prominent. Other prominent superstitions included vocalizations, consumption of food/drink (nonalcoholic), watching or not watching the action, and good luck charms/superstitious rituals.

AB - Team fandom origin, self-selected or socialized, should play an important role in one's level of team identification with and commitment to a favorite team. It was hypothesized that fans who self-selected their favorite team would report higher levels of team identification on three dimensions of team commitment: personal identity, affective commitment, and calculative commitment. Fans who were socialized to prefer a team were expected to report higher levels of two dimensions of team commitment: social obligation and regional tribalism. Participants completed the Sport Spectator Identification Scale, the Scale of Commitment to Sport Teams, and assessments of team fandom origin. It was found that socialized fans reported higher levels of social obligation and regional tribalism to their teams than self-selected fans. Additional findings include: Male fans reported higher levels of team identification, personal identity, affective commitment, calculative commitment, and social obligation than female fans; older fans reported more self-selection than younger fans; and female fans reported more socialization than male fans.

AB - The relation between conditions (more stable) and psychological skills (training need), discipline and category contribute lo the design of psychological training plans. In such plans, controlling anxiety is a critical factor. This study analysed a sample of 112 male and female athletes aged 16 to 45 from a variety of disciplines (volleyball, tennis and swimming) and categories (amateur, professional and youth). Questionnaires measuring psychological characteristics (CPRD) and anxiety levels (STAI) were administered. The results showed that men scored higher than women in cognitive coping skills (control of stress and mental ability). In contrast, women perceived both state and trail anxiety more intensely than men. Regarding discipline and category, the largest statistically significant differences were observed in variables related to menial ability.

AB - The study of psychological skill use in sport is a key area of research in sport psychology. Skilled athletes have been shown to use a variety of psychological skills in practice and competition to regulate their psychological states (Taylor, Gould, & Rolo, 2008; White & Hardy, 1998). However, the methods used to investigate psychological skill use have been questioned (Eccles, 2012). In particular, some studies have employed experimental procedures that constrain researchers' ability to elicit valid verbal reports of athletes' cognitive processes. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the use of psychological skills by golfers, as they prepared to putt, using a think-aloud cognitive process-tracing measure. Specifically, golfers' use of psychological skills during a particular episode (i.e., golf putting task), as indicated by think-aloud reports, was compared with their reported use of psychological skills in general, as measured by a traditional questionnaire instrument. Less-skilled (n = 26) and skilled golfers (n = 26) performed short- and long-distance golf putts under low- and high-stress conditions. On selected trials, participants verbalized their thoughts concurrent with task performance. For each putt, putt accuracy and the time taken to putt were measured. Also, for each putt, the concurrent think-aloud reports were transcribed, and statements indicative of psychological skill use were identified and tabulated. Results indicated a positive and moderate correlation between a traditional questionnaire measure of performers' general use of psychological skills (TOPS-2) and psychological skill use during actual task performance, as measured by think-aloud reports. Participants used psychological skills moderately during their practice and competition sessions, as measured by TOPS-2 and during their preparation to putt, as measured by think-aloud reports. Regardless of the measure used, psychological skill use did not differ significantly between the skill groups. As expected, both groups perceived the long-distance putts as more difficult than short-distance putts, and experienced more anxiety in the high-stress condition than the low-stress condition. However, participants in both groups did not increase their use of psychological skills with the increase in task difficulty or anxiety, as indicated by think-aloud reports. Psychological skill use after unsuccessful and successful putts was also analyzed; prior putt performance had no significant effect on psychological skill use, as measured by think-aloud reports. Despite the concerns that general measures of psychological skill, such as the TOPS-2, might not capture the actual thoughts being experienced by athletes (instead tapping a priori, implicit causal theories), the moderate correlation found here suggests some validity for the TOPS-2. Overall, this study represents a step toward better understanding and measurement of psychological skill use in athletes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Although many student-athletes find participation in college sports rewarding, there are many who experience difficulties. Student-athletes face the same concerns that nonathletes do which include becoming independent, coping with uncertainty, finding a clear purpose, and clarifying values (Astin, 1977; Chickering, 1969; Farnsworth, 1966; Pascarella & Terenzini, 2005). Social isolation, identity conflicts, and fear of failure become a reality for these student-athletes (Pinkerton, Hinz, & Barrow, 1989), consequently, student-athletes are at a possible risk to experience a wide range of distressful reactions linked to mental health. Many athletic departments are quick to handle an injury but not to handle emotional issues. For this reason, exploring the relationship between these factors of athletic identity and social support can provide new important information to individuals working with these student-athletes (e.g., sport psychologists, academic advisors, coaches, trainers). In a time when females are found to score lower in self-esteem, it is of vital importance that relationships and social support be strong and significant (Todd, 2003). Research has supported the theory that female student-athletes report higher levels of depressive symptoms, social anxiety and non-support than their male counterparts (Storch, 2008). There have been reports of higher levels of high risk drinking and depressive symptoms in female student-athletes (Zamboanga, 2008). The purpose of this study was to examine the health risk behaviors of female student-athletes and the relationship these behaviors have to their social support and athletic identity. The sample consisted of 190 female student-athletes in order to provide insight and data about the health risk behaviors of female student-athletes in Division I athletics. The sample was formed into two groups by type of sport. Group one was considered a team sport and included softball, basketball, volleyball, rowing and soccer. Group two was considered an individual sport and included golf, tennis, track, and gymnastics. Following are the significant correlations identified in this study: Sport had a moderate relationship with social support and a low but significant negative relationship with alcohol and eating disorders. GPA had a moderate to strong relationship with social support and a negative relationship with marijuana. Social support had a moderate relationship with HRB and a low but significant negative relationship with marijuana and alcohol. Athletic identity had a strong and moderate relationship with stress, HRB and alcohol and a low but significant relationship with depression. Stress had a strong relationship with depression and a low but significant relationship with alcohol. Marijuana and alcohol had a strong relationship with one another. Eating disorders and depression had a moderate relationship with one another. Significant ANOVA results are that group 1 scored higher than group 2 on alcohol use, and group 2 score higher than group 1 on eating disorders. Significant MANOVA results are: Reported Social Identity was greater in the team sport than the individual sport. Reported Exclusivity was greater in the individual sport than the team sport. Reported Social Support Quantity, Social Support Quality and Total Social Support, was higher in the Individual sport than the Team sport. Two regression models were formed using the totals of the Social Support Scale (Social Support Quality, Social Support Quantity) and the Athletic Identity Measurement Scale (SI-Social Identity, EX – Exclusivity, NA – negative affectivity of athletic identity). Results were that the variable of social support was the only significant predictor of GPA and had a medium effect. Both variables social support and athletic identity were significant predictors of HRB, with social support having a medium effect and athletic identity having a strong effect.

AB - In today's competitive and performance oriented culture many athletes are faced with mind and body separation and objectification. Even physical education programs at the universities are changing into more scientific based names like kinesiology and movement sciences. Movement based degrees are viewed as being subservient to other hard science degrees. Sport and exercise educators are faced with various issues influencing the implementation of adequate programs which would educate the physical and the mental to meet the needs of this group of students. This qualitative study utilizes phenomenology to engage the experience and the experiencer while in sport, human movement, play, and exercise. The focus of this study was to understand the lived experiences in the field of sport and movement to provide a description of how participants find meaning and mind/body connection in sport, human movement, play, and exercise. The data are presented in the words of the participants. Merleau-Ponty (1964) and Reid (2002) argue that to better understand sport and/or exercise phenomenology, one must refer directly to the source and learn from individuals who have experienced in the past. In addition to the body/self participants selected for this dissertation study, the lived sport and exercise experience examples can be located in Appendix E. This dissertation study will explore the phenomenological connection between mind and body and a description of sport experience, including human movement, play, and exercise through storytelling (life narrative approach). The lived experiences conveyed common themes including: (1) competition; (2) play; (3) passion; and (4) enjoyment. The themes were derived from the literature review. For example, what does your literature review tell you are the current themes in mind and body connection and do your interviews mirror, challenge, or add to these themes? Interviews with study participants revealed implications and application of study findings. The approaches suggested by the study results support (1) transformation towards the Natural Athlete and an (2) Appendix for sport and exercise educators.

AB - Athletic trainers work in clinical settings such as secondary schools, colleges and universities, sports medicine clinics, professional sports, hospitals, and other healthcare environments. However, with the rapid expansion of athletic training education programs (ATEP) over the years, another role for the athletic trainer has developed, the athletic trainer educator. Consequently, it is currently becoming increasingly apparent that athletic trainers must also be equipped with the knowledge and expertise to teach, mentor, and train the future generations of certified athletic trainers within the classroom. Recently, researchers (Hertel et al., 2001; Craig, 2006; Rich, 2009) have argued that athletic training instructors lack the necessary pedagogical knowledge to be more effective instructors. However, athletic training education is a unique environment that provides both a wealth of content knowledge and many opportunities for students and professionals to engage in inquiry, action, interaction, mentoring, and reflection. Does the athletic training environment provide informal opportunities for students and instructors to gain pedagogical expertise? To learn more about instructors’ preparation for teaching, this dissertation explored athletic training instructors perceived preparedness for teaching in an ATEP. This study used a mixed methods research approach through a self-developed and pre-piloted electronic questionnaire. The approach consisted of collecting and analyzing scalable quantitative and qualitative data as well as written narrative qualitative responses from 364 participants currently teaching within an ATEP. In addition, quantitative data was collected from ATEP program directors regarding their perceptions of pedagogy on instructor preparation and its place within athletic training (AT) education. Through the study’s findings, it became evident that instructors’ perceived preparedness for teaching is explained by several theories of learning, such as the mentor/protégé model of learning, experiential learning theory, and social learning theory. Demonstrated by their actions, attitudes, and beliefs, participants placed high value on pedagogy, its importance on effective teaching, and its place within AT education. Furthermore, from within athletic training’s unique clinical field and classroom settings, participants demonstrated how each environment provided them with their perceived foundations for teaching within an ATEP. Despite these findings, formal pedagogical preparation and its place within athletic training curricula needs further exploration. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - This study utilized a consumer marketing approach to investigate the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) market for sport psychology positions. Athletic administrators’ preferences for sport psychology positions were compared based on time commitment, affiliation, payment, services, and clients. Results indicated that services and affiliation were the most important characteristics. Specifically, athletic administrators found positions that were designed for part-time athletic department employees, providing both mental health and performance focused services, paid via annual salary, and working with athletes, teams, and athletics staff members as the most attractive positions; a market simulation suggested over twothirds of the sample would interested in hiring a sport psychology professional in this position. Furthermore, there were athletic administrators that were interested in all combination of the potential position characteristics. Implications suggest that the field of sport psychology continue to support multiple niches to most appropriately meet the perceived needs of NCAA athletic administrators.

AB - Be it a shiny sports car or a luxury watch, consumers are predisposed to approach appealing objects. However, rules of modern society restrict consumers from touching or taking objects based on a mere desire to do so. Instead, consumers must have a legal connection to an object—ownership—in order to have mastery over it. What are the cognitive implications of the transparent boundaries that society draws between consumers and objects that they do not own? Can these boundaries affect the way consumers mentally represent owned and unowned objects? How do such potential differences between mental representation of owned and unowned objects affect object evaluation and consumer choice? Addressing these questions, my dissertation suggests that the social and legal criteria that divide objects into 'mine' and 'not-mine' may lead consumers to classify objects as 'me' or 'not-me,' as internal or external to the category "self," namely to "egocentrically categorize" objects. Egocentric Categorization is suggested to be a cognitive "tool" that segments, classifies, and orders inanimate objects in consumers' environment, and thus guides consumers' appraisals of objects as well as consumers' judgment of the "self." Although ample research asserts that a consumer's possessions are associated with his or her "self," the possibility that people use the "self" as a reference category for products has not been examined. Addressing this gap in the literature, my dissertation introduces Egocentric Categorization as a new theoretical account and begins investigating implications of Egocentric Categorization for consumer judgment, behavior and choice.

AB - The purpose of the following study was to expand research on sports participation by assessing the relationship between organized sports participation and specific domains of behavioral and emotional functioning in elementary aged children. The data obtained may be used to help parents, educators, and clinicians understand the influence that sports participation has in children's lives and help influence the creation of primary prevention programs that target children's mental health. Organized sports, as opposed to free play or other forms of physical activity, were looked at as they provide boundaries, rules, and commitment. Additionally, as parent behaviors strongly influence children's development, the moderating role of parenting behaviors on this relationship was explored. The study included 70 mothers or fathers of children between the ages of six and eleven who attended elementary schools in New York and New Jersey. Overall, this study found that organized sports participation is associated with significant behavioral and emotional benefits for children and may serve as a protective factor against negative parenting behaviors. This research suggests that those who participate more in organized sports have fewer Aypicality and Withdrawal symptoms and have greater leadership skills than those who participate less. The more children enjoy participating in organized sports, the fewer Depression and Behavioral symptoms they have and the more leadership skills they possess. Significant gender differences and differences between contact and non-contact sports participants were found with regard to Internalizing symptoms.

AB - The design of effective interventions in sport psychology often requires a subtle blend of techniques, tailored to meet the client's specific needs. Input from a variety of disciplinary support specialists, working as a team, is also frequently needed Accordingly, this study investigated an interdisciplinary team approach to the technical change and rehabilitation of an elite weight lifter following injury; necessitating the avoidance of regression when performing under competitive pressure. Multiple coaching approaches were used and complimented by targeting specific mental skills. Kinematic analyses indicated progressive technical, and subsequently permanent, change even after 2 years. Self-report measures of self-efficacy and imagery use were deemed essential in facilitating the change. Finally, a discussion focuses on the intervention's multifactorial nature, its application within high performance coaching, and how this may advise future research into the refinement of already existing and well-established skills.

AB - Comments on an article by Deanna Perez, Stefanee Van Horn and Mark P. Otten (see record 2014-04938-019). The author have been blessed with the opportunity to spend time with Coach Wooden and work closely with those who have studied him extensively and those who have won championships with him. The author argues the need of scientific validation of Pyramid of Success . Perez et al contribute to the understanding of effective coaching and talent development. A critical examination of the scientific support for or against elements of popular mental models like the Pyramid of Success most certainly stimulate open dialogue and self reflection on how we collectively define 'success'. The author can imagine Coach Wooden looking down upon us at this very moment with an affirming smile cherishing the thoughtful dialogue that continues to be fuelled by a young high school boy's attempt to articulate success nearly 100 years ago.

AB - There has been little research devoted to understanding the sporting experience of Adventure Racing (AR) participants. Given the possible psychological benefits of AR participation, this investigation was undertaken to obtain additional insight into these competitors’ experience of participating in the Everglades Challenge. Existential phenomenological interviews were conducted with 10 participants ranging in age from 34 to 64 years who took part in the 2011 Everglades Challenge. Qualitative analysis of the transcripts revealed a total of 498 meaning units that were further grouped into subthemes, majors themes, and a primary ground. A final thematic structure revealed Adventure as the primary ground for the four major themes of Pushing Limits, Community, Preparation, and Natural Elements . The results suggest that AR can be transformational in many ways and that it provides an avenue for exploring personal meaning and promoting psychological benefits.

AB - Although coaches often talk about the importance of building a championship team, very few studies have addressed the mindset and psychosocial dynamics of teams winning multiple championships in a row. The purpose of this reflective report is to explore from a psychology of coaching perspective, factors perceived to be most paramount in building and sustaining a repeatable championship team culture over time. During the 2007–2010 seasons, a Division One NCAA university volleyball team won four successive national championships in a row. The lead author interviewed the head coach to ascertain his thoughts and reflections on foundational beliefs and coaching philosophy, program development and team norms, group dynamics and synergistic team functioning, and factors that influence the sustainability of excellence from year to year. Results from the structured interview were very enlightening, revealing insights into the importance of recruiting athletes that are the right fit, having a game plan to develop continuity and consistency from year to year, coaching for accountability and self-responsibility, reflections on true leadership and the essence of selfless service, mental skills training and the psychology of coaching, and getting athletes to buy into the program and perform with pride, collective confidence, and resiliency under pressure.

AB - Reviews the book, Routledge Companion to Sport and Exercise Psychology: Global Perspectives and Fundamental Concepts edited by Athanasios G. Papaioannou and Dieter Hackfort (see record 2013-21899-000). This substantial book addresses the major factors associated with sport and exercise, including understanding the types of influences others have on sport and exercise participation, specific techniques used to enhance athletic performance, what can be done to help people prioritize health and well-being, how an effective team structure is built and maintained, and the types of serious mental health concerns that can arise. This book is a significant contribution to the field and was supported by the International Society for Sport Psychology (ISSP) because it “fit with the mission of the organization to support and provide a global approach and international perspective on sport and exercise psychology issues” (p. xiii). Whether one is an advanced student of psychology contemplating the field of sport and exercise psychology as a career or an established professional considering retooling skills to focus on athletes and exercisers, this book will prove highly informative.

AB - Positive psychology is dedicated to balancing the psychological research equation by focusing on human strengths, virtues, health, and happiness in addition to human weaknesses, failings, sicknesses, and unhappiness. I have the special pleasure of introducing this book with three volumes. As a researcher I have long been interested in what promotes optimal functioning and the highest degree of happiness in individuals. The main goal of this volume is to analyze human training to achievement contexts. Using examples of developmental and high performance contexts, topics related to talent development, athletes and teams' training for high performance situations, and leaders' training to maximum professional efficacy (including mainly the cases of sports coaches) are discussed. How to coach individuals, teams, and leaders to high performance is addressed by authors Jean Cote, Eduardo Salas, Robert S. Weinberg, Wade Gilbert, Gordon Bloom, Harold Riemer, and many others. This is the journey through the complexity of human functioning being assumed in this book; it is a broad and deep perspective of the factors involved in human adaptation, human development, and human training. In sum, this book addresses the fundamental challenge referred to by Keimon M. Sheldon in the Preface of this book, namely, how to make things go right in our lives.

AB - This third edition of Exploring Sport and Exercise Psychology retains the focus of its predecessors, providing an overview of the field of sport and exercise psychology, connecting theory and practice, and discussing important practical issues related to credentialing and training. However, coverage of key areas such as assessment, diversity (with a focus on work with diverse groups, including master competitors), and international concerns has been expanded. New authors add fresh points of view to the topics covered, and current references and examples have been added to enrich this edition. We hope that this new edition will provide readers with a strong foundation in sport and exercise psychology and serve as a springboard for further exploration of the field.

AB - The present compilation marks the fifth consecutive year that Athletic Insight has teamed with Nova Science on the development of a compendium of writings from the journal. This year's contributions feature a series of international scholars from Canada, the United States, Norway, Finland, Denmark, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Norway, and Israel. Upon review of these submissions, one also finds an interesting turn on the part of the journal-that more than half of the submissions are from outside of North America. More broadly speaking, submissions were received form five continents, excluding the Arctic and Antarctica. Dissect the submissions further and you will recognize several senior authors within these submissions, including Ronnie Lidor, Craig Wrisberg, Diane Gill, David Lavallee, Theodore Butryn, Tatiana Ryba, and several more. Personally, I am quite excited by the series of authors and diversity in topic matter found in this compendium. I dare say that this year's compendium is the strongest offered by Athletic Insight to date. On behalf of the publisher and the editorial staff, I hope you enjoy the chapters that follow. What follows is a brief review of the contributions found in this compendium and then the accepted publications from 2013. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved)(introduction)

AB - The present study explored personality dimensions, as measured by the Junior Temperament and Character Inventory, passion and self-esteem among junior elite athletes. In addition, the athletes were compared with non-athletic peers to investigate if they had a personality profile which could be viewed as beneficial for the athlete. Female athletes scored significantly higher on the personality dimensions Reward Dependence and Cooperativeness, and significantly lower on Self-esteem than their male counterparts. In addition, the athlete sample scored significantly higher on Persistence and Self- Directedness and lower on Harm Avoidance than non-athletes. The use of the J-TCI as a measure of personality yielded significant differences between groups, which should be relevant for the sport psychology community and increase our understanding of personality dimensions among aspiring elite athletes.

AB - As is the case with many subfields of psychology, sport and exercise psychology encompasses a wide variety of clinical, educational, and research activities. A sport and exercise psychologist might work with elite or professional athletes, use exercise therapeutically with clients, conduct workshops for parents and youth sport coaches, and consult on the implementation of a community-based physical activity intervention. Although there may be no “typical” sport and exercise psychologist, all those who practice in this area should be familiar with a number of issues and content areas. Hence, this book is designed to acquaint psychologists, students, and other sport and mental health practitioners interested in sport and exercise psychology with basic interventions, clinical issues, special populations, and professional issues in the field. The primary purpose of this chapter is to provide an introduction to sport and exercise psychology—its historical foundations, research trends, current controversies, client populations, and applied settings. After a summary of the history and current status of the field, an overview of this volume is presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)

AB - In this chapter, the path towards a dynamic cognition is deemed to lie in coordination dynamics, a line of scientific enquiry that aims to understand, through theory, analysis and experiment, how patterns of coordinated behaviour emerge, persist, adapt and change in living things in general and human beings (and brains) in particular (Kelso 1995). Cognition arises from the coevolution of brains, bodies and the environment in which they are immersed; tempered, of course, by developmental and learning processes. Specific cognitive functions require coordination within and between specialized regions of the brain. The dual nature of this coordination, how the numerous parts of the brain retain their local individualized functions while interacting to form global context-dependent spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity may be understood through coordination dynamics, especially, as we shall see, in its multi- and metastable regimens. This theme of duality or coexistence permeates the entire chapter. In the next section, this dual, complementary nature of coordination dynamics is described, since it is crucial to the development of a truly (spatiotemporal) dynamic cognition. Self-organizing dynamics creates information and information modifies and directs dynamics. The following section stresses the need to identify relevant variables, parameters and their dynamics on a given level of description and articulates a research strategy ('constructive reduction') for doing just that, and for relating levels. A brief and non-inclusive summary of evidence is then presented for the first conceptual foundation of coordination dynamics, spontaneous self-organizing processes. Following this, the second, coexistent foundation of coordination dynamics is addressed: meaningful, often directed, information. Emphasis is placed on metastable coordination dynamics. This is the regimen in which the tendency of individual component parts and processes to function independently (sometimes called segregation) coexists with the tendency to coordinate together (sometimes called integration). In the final section of the chapter, some of the main messages of the coordination dynamics of learning are briefly presented, in the hope that these may be useful to practitioners and education policy makers, together with a short summary and some concluding remarks.

AB - Little is known about the factors that promote behavioural persistence among volunteer track and field officials. This preliminary qualitative study examined the explanations a sample of Canadian officials offered for their initial and continued involvement in track and field over time. Certified track and field officials ( N = 19) responded to 3 open-ended survey items exploring their reasons for initial, current, and future involvement in officiating. Content analysis indicated a varied and dynamic pattern of motivations that informed decisions to volunteer in the sport. Among them, intrapersonal factors were often cited as reasons for initial and current motivations for officiating, while a combination of intra- and interpersonal factors appeared salient reasons for anticipated future involvement. The current findings also support the important role played by satisfaction of the basic psychological needs outlined within Self-Determination Theory (Deci and Ryan, 2002) with respect to current involvement.

AB - The purpose of this article was to review a series of studies ( n = 16) on psychological and instructional aspects of serving in two racquet sports—tennis and badminton. The main findings of this review were that (a) imagery and self-talk can help players improve their serves in tennis and badminton; (b) task-pertinent learning strategies which are introduced at the beginning of the learning process, or at some time after some knowledge of the serve was acquired, can enhance serving performances of beginning learners; (c) although there are not enough data to indicate what type of feedback benefits serving performances, instructional feedback based on the correct movement of the server should be useful in practicing the serve; (d) contextual variety appears to improve the learning of the badminton serve. Implications for coaching are discussed based on the reviewed studies, taking into account a number of research limitations associated with these studies.

AB - Analyzing the influence of coaches on athlete performance and on the psychological experiences of team members (e.g., motivation, satisfaction, and cohesion) is a fascinating endeavor. Thus, it is not surprising that several authors have dedicated considerable effort to studying coaches' mental representations and actions being proposed important conceptual models (Chelladurai, 1993; Côté, Salmela, Trudel, Baria, & Russell, 1995; Smoll & Smith, 1989; Jowett, 2007). Despite the unequivocal interest in these proposals, insufficient attention has been given to recent developments in leadership research, namely charismatic and transformational leadership (Bass, 1985; Bums, 1978; Conger & Kanungo, 1987; House, 1977). Therefore, analyzing the application of transformational leadership in sports contexts becomes important. Taking this need into consideration, this chapter aims to: (a) review the theoretical proposals and research conducted regarding charismatic /transformational leadership in several organizational contexts; (b) review the research conducted regarding transformational leadership in sports; and (c) propose conceptual, empirical, and practical guidelines cocerning the application of transformational leadership in sports.

AB - The purpose of this study was to explore subjective beliefs among coaches in elite sports about what they think are effective communication during performance appraisals with their athletes. A Q-sample of 36 different opinions about different underlying aims for communication, and how this affects athletes' abilities to understand better (knowing), to perform better (doing), and/ or improve their focus, were presented to sport coaches from different top level sports. A sample of statements drawn from the actual concourse of communication was presented to 19 elite coaches who were asked to consider and rank-order the statements regarding performance appraisals through Q-sorting procedure. The authors will discuss their analysis using Q methodology, where a three factors solution was chosen from the factor analysis. In general, the coaches share some common viewpoints across the three factors (consensus), and believe that the communication process should be aimed at stimulating both coaches' and their athletes' understanding about their performances. Attending behaviour such as the ability to ask their athletes open questions and listen to what they are saying seems to be a necessity for coaches during performance appraisals. Interestingly, the importance of instructive behaviour is also emphasized among two of the three factors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)

AB - Although sport is played with the body, it is won mainly in the mind. But what exactly should athletes pay attention to and think about in striving for optimal performance in competitive situations? Answers to such questions about cognitive strategies in sport may be found in the field of cognitive sport psychology, the scientific study of mental processes in athletes (Moran, 2009). This chapter begins with an outline of paradigm changes that have led cognitive psychologists to abandon their traditional indifference to sport in favor of a more enthusiastic attitude. Next, key underlying principles and strategies used in achieving optimal attentional focus in sport performance are discussed. The relationship between self-talk and sport performance is explored. Finally, practical tips for effective thought management are presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)

AB - The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between athletic identity and physical activity among former college athletes. The relationship was first examined with former Division I athletes ( N = 56) and then in a second sample of former Division III athletes (N = 18) and non-athletes (N = 31) from a small college. All participants (N = 105) completed the Athletic Identity Measurement Scale (AIMS), the Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire, and the Stage of Exercise Behavior Change measure. The AIMS was a positive predictor of physical activity, and this relationship was stronger for alumni who had participated in college athletics. While former college athletes had higher AIMS scores, they were not more active than alumni who did not participate in college athletics. Former athletes were also more likely than non-athletes to report a decrease in physical activity after college. Substantial decreases in physical activity after the conclusion of a collegiate athletic career have important health implications for former college athletes, which warrant the development of transitional programs that promote lifelong physical activity participation among NCAA student-athletes.

AB - Although many people with disabilities are sedentary, physical activity (PA) involvement results in a host of benefits for those that are physically active. In addition to common reasons (e.g., lack of time) noted for low PA levels, people with disabilities also face a variety of individual (e.g., pain), social (e.g., fewer workout friends) and environmental (e.g., no curb cuts) barriers unique to their disability condition. Youth sport opportunities are similar to the limited PA participation opportunities for adults, but the benefits children derive from sport span psychological (e.g., enhanced efficacy), social (e.g., stronger friendships) and physiological areas. Finally, elite level athletes (e.g., Paralympians) have to deal with many sport related challenges and disability derived challenges that can undermine optimal training and performance. However, strong mental skills (e.g., imagery), sport specific psychological factors (e.g., sport efficacy) and personality traits (e.g., tough-mindedness) and mood states (e.g., vigor) are associated with superior performance suggesting important roles for sport psychologists.

AB - The field of applied sport and performance psychology is booming. More graduate education programs are emerging, attracting increasing numbers of qualified students, and growing the exposure and knowledge base of the field (Quinn, 2011). Coupled with a Strong theoretical and research foundation, applied sport psychology consulting experiences are vital to developing well-rounded professionals in the field (Balague, 2011). Guided by the three fundamentals of positive relationships, exchange relationships, and positive self-efficacy. Network Theory (Turnbull, Ford, and Cunningham, 1996) can provide graduate students with the opportunities and experiences in which to practice their applied sport psychology skills. Future applied sport psychology consultants will need to mesh their academic foundation with solid business, marketing, advertising, and branding skills and techniques to grow their personal consulting brand as well as the field of sport psychology. This article provides theory-driven practical applications of Network Theory for sport psychology students whose goal is to enhance their depth of knowledge through applied sport psychology consulting experiences.

AB - Sport has always served me well. I moved every four years as a child and went to up to six schools in four different countries. Throughout my childhood, sport was my constant companion and also a way of making new friends and settling into new environments. I was initially intrigued by the idea of being a barrister but following a mini-pupillage in London, I knew that was not for me. A chance conversation with someone in my psychology class led me to explore the idea of an MSc in Sport Psychology. In a break between lectures, Paul (who went on to be the first man to canoe from Ulan Bator to the Pacific) suggested that I might be interested in an MSc at Exeter University that he was looking into. To this day I do not know why he mentioned this to me, but at a wedding of a mutual friend over 10 years later I did thank him. Following this conversation, I started to explore different MSc options and after a conversation with Ken Fox when he was up in St Andrews to viva a PhD, I opted for Exeter. Alongside my BASES accreditation I eventually started to do some training in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) at the Oxford Cognitive Therapy Center. This played a major part in the evolution of my consulting philosophy. My six years as a lecturer provided a very solid research-based platform on which my applied practice was built. Over time, the amount of applied work I did grew. A lot of my early practice was based on mental skills, but I quickly integrated CBT into my work. My approach is built around the aim of preparing athletes and coaches to be able to train to perform at their optimum when they need to. This is a complex aim and I break it down into three interacting cogs: (1) knowing yourself; (2) stretching yourself; and (3) coping. Neuropsychological advances in the past 10 years have been a major influence on my work, and an understanding of how the brain works forms a large part of how I help athletes and coaches understand themselves more clearly. This may include understanding elements such as the impact of perceived unfairness on the brain; how the brain reacts to threat to ego in a similar fashion to physical threat; that self-control is like a muscle, or the impact of mindfulness/meditation on the size of the insula. Since 2007, I have also utilised the Insights Discovery psychometric as part of self-awareness and self-regulation promotion and have used it extensively for coach—athlete relationships and team dynamics. In terms of 'stretching yourself', this has led to education on being value-driven as well as goal-driven and also a lot of work on the environment that athletes and coaches are in. In writing this piece I hope I have shared some insight into my own development, the different careers and roles I have had as a sport psychologist alongside the varied demands and challenges of my current day job. I feel I have had a good balance between the science and art of sport psychology in my development. The result is that I feel comfortable providing both proactive and reactive psychological support.

AB - Coaches and practitioners recognize that talent identification and development have a crucial role in the pursuit of excellence. National governing bodies routinely allocate youth participants, irrespective of biological age, to chronological age categories in an effort to ensure developmentally fair competition and opportunity. However, differences in the timing and tempo of maturation provide evidence to exclude chronological age and can lead to the misclassification of children in relation to their biological maturity. The purpose of this study was to explore coaches' perceptions of how they use chronological age and biological age in coaching practice, and the importance they place on the measurement and utilization of biological age to develop young athletes. We conducted semi-structured interviews with six coaches and analyzed data using a qualitative description methodology. The results revealed three main themes relating to the delivery of the long-term athlete development model, the limited or lack of knowledge of all aspects of the long-term athlete development model, and a desire for a different model. Results provide scholars and practitioners with a greater understanding of coaches' perspectives of the use of chronological and biological age in the identification and development of talented athletes.

AB - For as long as I can remember, sport has played an integral part in my life—as a player, fan, coach, and now psychologist. I have found and still do find myself consumed by the drug that is competitive sport on a regular basis. Shortly after my sixth birthday I arrived home from school to find a brand new cricket bat, ball and gloves laid out in the garden—my life would never be the same again. Fast-forward to the age of 17, under the instruction of my county coaches (I was now part of the Leicestershire county academy), I moved to one of the best senior sides in the area so that I could further develop my skills and build my experience playing in the local Premier League. It was around this time that I also started to become aware and I guess somewhat interested in the role of the mind in relation to my cricket performance. During practice I would feel great and play really well—lots of confidence, freedom, and expression. When it came to games, on occasions, I started to feel different. What was going on? On occasions, I would walk out to bat and would feel heavy-legged, tense, and concerned about what I was going to do. Some days my batting would go great and I would play naturally and score the runs I so badly wanted. Other days (after a poor performance) I would sit in the pavilion asking questions of myself about technique and preparation, and even blaming my equipment. The game I loved so much and wanted to do so well at had become complicated — and the most frustrating part was that neither I nor my coaches had any answers. Sport psychology was largely on the periphery of professional cricket at this time and so I continued to practise hard and maintain my efforts, but slowly and surely my confidence and enjoyment for the game were dwindling. At the time I had no idea that my experiences would influence my interest in sport psychology and in years to come I would provide psychological support to sports people and in particular cricketers with similar performance-related issues, along with co-authoring a text on the psychology of cricket (Coterill and Barker, 2013).

AB - This article reviews approaches to studying sportspersonship, moral behavior in sport and broader morality theory to offer practical strategies to enhance fair play. By identifying stages and levels of morality and reviewing research supporting the relationship between goal orientations and moral behavior, we propose five practical strategies. Namely, we suggest that developing a mastery climate, developing a moral community, role taking, reflection and power transfer can be effectively used to progress performers from pre-conventional to a conventional level of morality and ultimately, establish principled morality in sport.

AB - In this case study of a Danish elite handball team, we explore team learning processes in order to examine to what extent team members' development of expertise is a shared deliberate practice. By drawing from theoretical frameworks on expertise and deliberate practice (Ericsson, 2006) and team cognition (Salas, Fiore, and Letsky, 2012), we aim to answer what characterizes efficient and successful handball team training. The case study involved participant observation and interviews, and it included the female first team in a Danish handball club Randers HK. The team is amongst the best three teams in Denmark. In particular, the case study found that important factors for shared deliberate practice are concentration, feedback and role modeling. There are four theoretical findings. 1. Deliberate practice in team sport is a shared activity. 2. Both structured tactical training and match training are deliberate practices. 3. Concentration mediates team cognitive skills. 4. Feedback and role modeling mediate team cognitive skills. From an applied perspective, this study points to the value of seeing team sport as necessitating shared deliberate practice. Team players need to train shared understanding and learn how to negotiate the coach's orchestration of the game plan. Specifically, the results may lead experienced coaches in high performance team sports to use experienced athletes to engage in verbal feedback and being explicit role models to less experienced players.

AB - The purpose of this study was to explore elite Korean tennis players' career transition experiences, focusing on psychological components (i.e., self-identity, life skills development, and coping strategies) and socio-cultural influences through the process. A longitudinal qualitative method was employed, and Korean tennis players ( N = 5; two males and three females; mean age 29.8 ± 5.54 years) who were considering retirement participated in the current study. Data were analyzed by interpretative phenomenological analysis and resulted in three super-ordinate themes: (a) sense of self and process of identity shift, (b) available resources during the career transition process, and (c) decision-making processes and consequences of decisions. These results provided practical implications for supporting athletes' career transitions (e.g., developing a balanced self-identity and life skill during their athletic careers, providing proactive intervention) and future research directions (e.g., examining athletes' retirement decision-making process, the need of cross-cultural research).

AB - Thirty-nine college students enrolled in a swimming class participated in a psychological skills training program (PST) called UNIFORM (Gilbert, 2011). The self-efficacy based program examined the relationships between the participants' use of psychological skills, self-efficacy, swim conditioning and techniques. Results demonstrated greater use of the psychological skills of relaxation and self talk. Improvements in swim conditioning and technique, as well as increases in swim conditioning and technique efficacy, and the efficacy to swim in the future were also acknowledged. Imagery, self-talk, goal-setting, emotional control and attentional control were positively associated with swim conditioning and swim technique self-efficacy and future swim self-efficacy. Furthermore, swim conditioning and swim technique self efficacy, as well as future swim self-efficacy, were related to swim performance with results demonstrating swim technique self-efficacy to be the greatest predictor of swim performance. Therefore, PST interventions act as moderators to self-efficacy, while self-efficacy mediates students' performances and subsequent perceptions to swim for exercise in the future. Thus, PST interventions based in self-efficacy may help college-age students improve their swim self-efficacy, conditioning, skills, and efficacy to exercise in the future.

AB - Most sport psychologists identify with either psychology or sport science. Professionals who enter the field with a preparation in counseling psychology often find themselves misclassified as clinical specialists. By training, counseling psychologists focus on individuals’ strengths and adaptive strategies across the life span, a focus that has more in common with educational sport psychology (Petitpas, Buntrock, Van Raalte, & Brewer, 1995; Petitpas, Danish, & Giges, 1999). The purpose of this chapter is to examine counseling-based interventions with athletes. Specifically, (a) a definition of counseling-based interventions is discussed, (b) the role of sport in human development is explored, (c) several examples of counseling-based interventions are outlined, and (d) suggestions for working with athletes from a counseling perspective are offered.

AB - The relationship between motivations for running a marathon and the benefits derived from its completion has not been systematically explored in the sport psychology literature. This study investigated motivations and perceived benefits of marathon participation in a non-elite population of runners. Ninety-nine runners completed questionnaires examining motivations and perceived benefits of marathon participation immediately after the event. Confirmatory factor analysis of a scale designed for the present study confirmed that the perceived benefits of marathon participation can be categorized as Psychological, Physical, and Relational. As expected, marathoners' motivations for running were predictive of perceived benefits along similar categories. Interestingly, participants also experienced perceived benefits that extended beyond their original motivations for running the marathon. The results of this study add to the body of evidence suggesting that marathon running enhances physical, psychological, and relational health.

AB - The purpose of this investigation was to determine differences in exercise motivation across age groups and gender of recreational endurance athletes (N = 2756), ages 18-64. Participants selected their top 3 motives from a list of 10 intrinsic and extrinsic factors, which across all individuals were enjoyment (57.1%), performance (53.3%), and health (51.9%). Performance motivation was endorsed by 79.7% of those aged 18-24 years vs. 37.8% of those aged 55-64 years. Women selected weight maintenance (26.8% vs. 17.4%) and appearance (15.7% vs. 7.0%) to a greater degree than men. Men endorsed improving performance (54.6% vs. 47.1%), living longer (18.5% vs. 9.7%) and feeling better (26.0% vs. 20.3%) as a primary motives more than women. There was a nonsignificant ( p = 0.049) age and gender interaction for weight maintenance with gender differences apparent in younger age groups but not in older ages.

AB - Measurement in sport and exercise psychology is a broad topic that includes measurement of psychological factors related to sport performance; of exercise adherence and related constructs; of team-related factors; of cognitive, affective, and self-assessment of athletes; and more (Tenenbaum, Eklund, & Kamata, 2012). There is not one “best” way to assess athletes and exercisers for performance enhancement, clinical concerns, or research purposes. Rather, the theoretical orientation of the practitioner and/or researcher guides the assessment and subsequent plan of action that is developed. The purpose of this chapter is to highlight key aspects of measurement in sport and exercise psychology. We begin with a brief history of measurement in sport and exercise psychology, followed by an overview of methods for capturing psychological processes in athletes. Next, we discuss cultural, ethical, and other issues related to measurement within sport and exercise psychology settings. We conclude with a presentation of tools for measuring psychological factors relevant to sport and exercise psychology (e.g., psychological skills, motivation, cognitive and perceptual processes, self-perception, affect, mood and emotion, perceived effort, team-related attributes, physical activity outcomes).

AB - Research on international labor migration in professional sports (e.g., Magee & Sugden, 2002) suggests that the experiences of athletes in foreign cultures are often diverse and entail numerous pressures. In order to examine such experiences in greater depth, existential phenomenological interviews (Thomas & Pollio, 2002) were conducted with ten current and former professional basketball players, ages 24 to 55, from the US. Thematic analysis of the interview transcripts produced eight major themes that clearly characterized participants' experiences: Learning the Local Mentality, Experiencing Isolation, Connecting with Others, Exploring the Physical Environment, Dealing with the Business, Adjusting to Team Resources, Managing Team Dynamics, and Playing the Game. Taken together, the results suggest that while playing overseas required participants to manage a variety of cultural and sport-related stressors, it also afforded them opportunities for personal and professional development.

AB - Psychological Skills Training is implemented in athletes and/or teams to enhance their overall performance. When implementing this training, a sport psychologist may work with an athlete who needs to enhance psychological aspects related to sport performance, or if the athlete has a clinical problem and will then need to be referred to a clinical psychologist. In this chapter, the focus is on implementing psychological skills to enhance performance. Establishing effective goals, using relaxation techniques, practicing imagery, reflecting on mental processes, and having a positive self-talk are appropriate psychological techniques. There are two types of programs: the Psychological Skills Training Program (PSTP) which allows athletes to learn psychological strategies that can be applied in practice sessions or competitions, and the Applied Psychology Program to Practice Sessions (APPPS) which aims at optimizing practice sessions, so the psychologist focuses on enhancing these sessions through psychological strategies. Clinical, field, or online intervention are three types of programs the sport psychologist must implement depending on the athlete's or team's needs.

AB - Athletic competition for children is a firmly established part of American society. In the United States, it is estimated that about 60.3 million youngsters 6 to 18 years of age participate in agency-sponsored youth sports, such as Little League Baseball, the American Youth Soccer Organization, and the Boys and Girls Clubs (National Council of Youth Sports, 2008). Additionally, about 7.5 million youth (4.4 million boys, 3.1 million girls) participate in high school sports (National Federation of State High School Associations, 2010). Nearly 70% of Canadian youth participate in organized sport at least occasionally during the school year (Canadian Heritage, 2003). A similar participation level exists in Australia (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2007). A realistic appraisal of youth sports indicates that participation does not automatically result in either beneficial or detrimental effects for all children (Fredricks & Eccles, 2006). We believe that the sport environment affords a strong potential for achieving desirable objectives. The question is not whether youth sports should continue to exist, for they are here to stay. The real issue is how the programs can be effectively structured and conducted in ways that ensure attainment of positive outcomes. In this chapter, we focus on methods developed by sport psychologists to influence the effects of sport participation in a positive direction through interventions directed at coaches, parents, and athletes.

The chapter begins with an explanation of the distinctions among college and university programs and types of athletes. Next, we discuss developmental issues relevant to intercollegiate athletes. We then move to some of the specific pressures that are faced by intercollegiate athletes on and off the field, including academics, time management, injury, the media, and clinical mental health issues. The chapter concludes with a discussion of how practitioners can work effectively in intercollegiate sport environments. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)

AB - In this chapter we consider psyching up and psyching down in sport. These terms refer to techniques that are used to increase arousal (psych up) or decrease arousal (psych down). We introduce the topic by explaining the central role of arousal in sport. Then we consider the relationship of arousal to performance, noting that although precise effects have not been determined, we now consider that there is an inverted-U relationship when cognitive state anxiety is low, but that this breaks down as cognitive state anxiety increases. Arousal is also related to enjoyment, but again the relationship is complex. In some circumstances some people find high arousal pleasant, but for others it is unpleasant. Our conclusion for these two relationships is that it is important to manage arousal level to optimize performance and motivation. To do this it is necessary to measure arousal. We explain that this has not been a simple task. We discuss physiological, self-report, and behavioral measures. We then move onto the main topic, the discussion of techniques to increase (psych up) and decrease (psych down) arousal. Psyching up techniques are divided into personal and environmental categories. Personal techniques are those where athletes address their own physical and psychological processes. These include breathing techniques, use of arousing words and phrases, behaving in physically arousing ways, and imagining arousing situations in sport. Environmental techniques originate outside the individual. They include arousing behavior of teammates, as well as stimulating music played before or during performance. Psyching down techniques include bodily relaxation techniques (muscle/somatic) that aim to calm the mind by relaxing the body mental relaxation techniques that focus on calming the mind, so that physical arousal reduction follows, and other techniques that are based on psychological processes used to manage thoughts and feelings. Throughout the chapter we make two important points. First, all these techniques involve learning skills and that is a process like the learning of sports skills that requires substantial practice. Second, arousal control is a complex process. A trained psychologist should be involved to monitor and advise athletes. Even then psyching up and psyching down are still part science, part art, and part trial and error. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)

Because the practice of a profession serves as the primary interface of the field with the general public and encompasses both legal and professional issues, no other area in an applied profession generates as much attention and controversy as codifying standards for professional preparation and practice (see Brooks & Gerstein, 1990, on the credentialing of counselors; see Cummings, 1990, and Fretz & Mills, 1980, on credentialing of professional psychologists). The general public views the educational background and professional behavior of those who practice as the model for the field. The field of sport and exercise psychology is no exception. There has been considerable debate as to the range of services that should be provided within sport and exercise psychology (Kirschenbaum, 1994; Morgan, 1988), who should provide those services, and how these individuals should be trained (Andersen, Van Raalte, & Brewer, 2001; Danish & Hale, 1981; Heyman, 1993; May, 1993; Monahan, 1987; Morris, Alfermann, Lintunen, & Hall, 2003; Silva, 1989). Certification is a function of a professional organization that attempts to codify a common standard of preparation and practice. At a beginning stage, these standards must serve the dual purpose of recognizing the experience of members currently in the field and setting guidelines for those newer members who wish to pursue sport and exercise psychology. The purpose of this chapter is to (a) define terminology associated with certification, which in our opinion has been at the root of much controversy; (b) provide a history of certification from an international perspective; (c) provide a rationale for the existence of the certification process; (d) outline and respond to criticisms that have been levied against certification; and (e) explore future improvements in certification that could further develop the field.

AB - We evaluated several behavioral coaching procedures with two young adults who had intellectual and developmental disabilities and were preparing for a Special Olympics track event. The primary dependent measure was their time running a 100 m sprint. Following a baseline phase, the athletes were coached to improve sprint times through different combinations of goal setting, performance feedback, positive reinforcement, and video modeling. In a sequential design, the average sprint time of both athletes was lower during intervention conditions compared with baseline. Following intervention, they ran faster than their baseline average in competition at a regional Special Olympics event. We discuss intervention and research issues in behavioral coaching of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.

AB - The aim of this pilot study was to explore disordered eating (DE) literacy in male and female athletes and to examine whether any gender differences were present. A related aim was to examine the moderating effect of gender on the relationship between indices of DE literacy and attitudes toward help-seeking for DE. A nonclinical sample of 133 (37% male) athletes from a variety of sports and competitive levels were recruited to complete an online questionnaire addressing a range of topics linked to DE literacy. Chi-square analysis indicated no significant gender differences on indicators of DE literacy. Findings from the survey revealed a number of beliefs conducive to low or inappropriate help-seeking for DE. The results highlight the importance of exploring DE literacy in athletes to develop more targeted interventions for this specific population.

AB - Research on experiences of Indian athletes is limited. This is the first study that explored the organizational stressors experienced by Indian elite female athletes and the impact on their psychological well-being. Ten participants were interviewed on their experiences with sport organizations in preparation for international tournaments. Drawing on Arnold and Fletcher's (2012) taxonomic classification of organizational stressors in sport performers, a range of first- and second-order themes were identified and categorized. The emergent themes were aligned with the dimensions of psychological well-being (Ryff 1989a). The study added to the existing literature on organizational stressors by considering them in a different cultural context as well as their link with psychological well-being. Perceived bias and lack of support from the sport organizations, limited access to support staff, and lack of basic training necessities were identified as the most commonly cited stressors. Data analysis led to the emergence of new themes specific to the Indian sports climate, such as, perceived gender discrimination and limited scope for a career in sports for female athletes. Consequently, the stressors resulted in feelings of low environmental mastery and personal growth. Recommendations are made for future research and practical implications for sport organizations and sport psychologists are identified.

AB - The purpose of the present paper is to illustrate how leaders can create high performance environments. Using Team Great Britain (TeamGB) cycling’s performance director as a case example, we discuss how leaders can develop social identities (i.e. an emotional attachment and sense of belonging) and shape group meanings as mechanisms through which performance excellence can be achieved. We draw on a contemporary theory of leadership derived from organisational and social psychology to explain how leaders can act to strengthen the emotional bonds within their sport group and motivate athletes to embrace specific group meanings. The present paper also reflects on the lessons learnt from London 2012 that could inform leadership practice in preparation for Rio 2016. In particular, the leaders’ role in developing social identities and distinctive group meanings is important to create an environment conducive to optimum performance. In sum, a social identity approach to leadership detailed within the current paper provides a useful framework to help maximise the opportunities that TeamGB gleaned from London 2012 in order to deliver performance excellence again in Rio 2016.

AB - Background: There are specific guidelines regarding the level of physical activity (PA) required to provide health benefits. However, the research underpinning these PA guidelines does not address the element of social health. Furthermore, there is insufficient evidence about the levels or types of PA associated specifically with psychological health. This paper first presents the results of a systematic review of the psychological and social health benefits of participation in sport by children and adolescents. Secondly, the information arising from the systematic review has been used to develop a conceptual model. Methods: A systematic review of 14 electronic databases was conducted in June 2012, and studies published since 1990 were considered for inclusion. Studies that addressed mental and/or social health benefits from participation in sport were included. Results: A total of 3668 publications were initially identified, of which 30 met the selection criteria. There were many different psychological and social health benefits reported, with the most commonly being improved self-esteem, social interaction followed by fewer depressive symptoms. Sport may be associated with improved psychosocial health above and beyond improvements attributable to participation in PA. Specifically, team sport seems to be associated with improved health outcomes compared to individual activities, due to the social nature of the participation. A conceptual model, Health through Sport, is proposed. The model depicts the relationship between psychological, psychosocial and social health domains, and their positive associations with sport participation, as reported in the literature. However, it is acknowledged that the capacity to determine the existence and direction of causal links between participation and health is limited by the fact that the majority of studies identified (n=21) were cross-sectional. Conclusion: It is recommended that community sport participation is advocated as a form of leisure time PA for children and adolescents, in an effort to not only improve physical health in relation to such matters as the obesity crisis, but also to enhance psychological and social health outcomes. It is also recommended that the causal link between participation in sport and psychosocial health be further investigated and the conceptual model of Health through Sport tested.

AB - Concussions are more serious than previously believed, and awareness of this fact has been increasing in both military and sports settings. Also known as mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), concussions often occur multiple times in the same service member or athlete. These brain injuries can seriously and negatively affect patients, leading to changes in personality, sleep problems, and cognitive impairments. They can also increase the risk for suicide, posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - At moderate intensity, an external focus of attention leads to improved running economy compared with an internal focus. In this experimental study, we assessed whether this finding also holds for running at high intensity levels despite predictions of Tenenbaum’s (2001) model. The model holds that an external attentional strategy would not be maintainable at high intensities. Twenty trained runners ran 3 × 10 min on a treadmill at a speed corresponding to 85% of their maximum oxygen consumption (VO 2max ). For each of the three 10-min blocks, they were instructed to focus their attention on different cues (internal: breathing, external: video, control: no instructed focus). Dependent measures were oxygen consumption (VO2), heart rate, blood lactate, and Ratings of Perceived Exertion (RPE). Results revealed a significant effect of attentional focus on VO2. An external focus can be applied during high-intensity running and is beneficial in terms of running economy compared with an internal focus. This finding sheds new light on the model proposed by Tenenbaum and its predictions about an unavoidable internal focus at high intensities.

AB - Objective: Previous research has indicated that older adults who expect decline and disease with age are less likely to engage in aerobic exercise. This study explores the influence that different types of aging expectations have on various modes of physical activity (PA) among aging adults. Design & methods: Community-dwelling adults aged 41e97 years ( M = 70.8, SD = 12.8, n = 247) completed a questionnaire including the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly, the Expectations Regarding Aging (ERA) Survey, and a number of demographic, socio-economic, and medical covariates. Results: Bivariate analyses revealed significant relationships between overall ERA scores and multiple modes of PA, but not at multivariate levels. Bivariate analyses of the ERA sub-scales revealed significant associations among PA and the physical health ERA sub-scale but not mental health or cognitive function ERA sub-scales. In the multivariate analyses, higher physical health ERA was correlated with strenuous sport and recreational physical activities after adjusting for all covariates among aging adults without restrictions of daily activity (OR = 1.01, CI = 1.00−1.02, n = 194). Conclusions: The association between aging expectations and PA appears to be dependent on the type of aging expectation (i.e., physical health), the mode or intensity of PA, and the functional abilities of the aging adult.

AB - Quiet eye training, a decision training intervention developed by Vickers and colleagues (see Vickers [Vickers, J.N. 2007. Perception, cognition and decision training: The quiet eye in action . Champaign: Human Kinetics] for a review), has been shown to facilitate anxiety-resistant performance in novice learners [Vine, S.J., & Wilson, M.R. 2010. Quiet eye training: Effects on learning and performance under pressure. Journal of Applied Sport Psychology, 22 , 361–376; Vine, S.J., & Wilson, M.R. 2011. The influence of quiet eye training and pressure on attention and visuomotor control. Acta Psychologica, 136 , 340– 346]. However, the potential mechanisms underpinning this beneficial effect are not fully known. This study examined the effects of a quiet eye training intervention on golf putting performance (mean performance error), gaze control (quiet eye duration), and one possible psychological mechanism; cognitive appraisal (evaluation of perceived demands and resources). Thirty novice participants were randomly assigned to a quiet eye or technical trained group and completed 420 baseline, training, retention, and pressure putts. Gaze was measured using an ASL Mobile Eye Tracker. Cognitive anxiety and appraisal were assessed via the mental readiness form-3 [Krane, V. 1994. The mental readiness form as a measure of competitive state anxiety. The Sport Psychologist, 8 , 189–202] and cognitive appraisal ratio [Tomaka, J., Blascovich, J., Kelsey, R.M., & Leitten, C.L. 1993. Subjective, physiological, and behavioural effects of threat and challenge appraisal. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 65, 248–260], respectively. Although both groups experienced greater cognitive anxiety ( p < .001), the quiet eye trained group performed more accurately ( p < .001), displayed more effective gaze control ( p < .001), and appraised the pressure test more favourably than the technical trained group ( p < .05). The more positive appraisal arose from the quiet eye trained group reporting a greater perception of coping resources than the technical trained group ( p < .05). Mediation analyses revealed that cognitive appraisal mediated the relationship between training group and mean radial error during the pressure test. Thus, quiet eye training protects against performance failure under increased anxiety by amplifying perceived coping resources, permitting performers to appraise demanding competitive situations more adaptively, as a challenge rather than a threat.

AB - Researchers sought to identify and analyze the actions of elite swimmers on a competition day that the athletes believed were critical to their success, and to understand the meaning the athletes assigned to each of these activities. The present study describes the competition-day routines of the elite swimmers by presenting the athletes’ actions, meanings, segments, and preparations within a substantive grounded theory. To this end, five U.S. Olympic medal-winning male swimmers from the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympic Games participated in a three-stage data collection: an initial interview during a two-day training visit, a competition observation at an elite meet, and a follow-up interview via telephone. In addition, each participant’s coach was interviewed. Utilizing constructivist grounded theory (Charmaz, 2006), a substantive theory of a competition-day routine for elite swimmers emerged. Results suggested that athletes understood all their actions during a competition day as one routine, and research of competitive routines should include both the ostensive (i.e., plan) and performative (i.e., enactment) aspects of routines (Feldman & Pentland, 2003).

AB - The institution of the Olympic Village—designated housing and amenities for athletes, coaches, officials and media participating in Olympic and Winter Olympic Games—constitutes perhaps the most significant contribution of the Olympic Movement to urban development and renewal in the cities where the Games have been staged. It has stimulated innovation in planning, architecture, technology, environmental renewal, protection and sustainability, and public and private finance and, in many cases, has been the subject of intense scrutiny, even controversy. But how well has the Olympic Village served participants, especially the athletes, and to what extent has it enabled the intercultural communication and exchange so fundamental to the core aspirations of the Olympic Movement? This paper pursued those questions at a conference organized by the Olympic Study Centre at the Autonomous University of Barcelona and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1996. I suggested that most athletes experience the Village as a contradiction, frustrating to both their preparations for competition and their desire to be a part of and contribute to a world community devoted to sporting excellence. I argued that every Olympic athlete should be required to live in the Village and encouraged to participate in intercultural activities, but to justify such a condition, the IOC and the organizing committees should give much more attention to the conditions of life within the Village. The paper anticipates some of the considerations that have gone into the design of the Youth Olympic Games. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - The current article explore that awareness of the potential long-term effects of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) that has increased in recent years. Certain populations, such as military service members and athletes who play contact sports, are susceptible to repetitive mTBI. With the United States operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, where explosive devices have been commonly used, blast-related brain injuries have come under scrutiny. Each year, about 28,000 service members experience a traumatic brain injury, most of which are considered mild but are frequently repetitive. In the sports world, a consequence of repeated mild brain trauma that was first identified in boxing as "punch drunk" syndrome has been recognized in other contact sports as well. The US Army and the National Football League have recently partnered to share research and to encourage current and former personnel to recognize their own or others' brain injuries and seek help. Concussions are more serious than previously believed. Brain injuries, especially multiple ones, can have serious negative impacts on patients, leading to changes in personality, sleep problems, and cognitive impairment and can increase the risk for suicide, PTSD, depression, and anxiety. In some people, repetitive mTBI can lead to CTE, a neurodegenerative disorder. As awareness and reporting of mTBI in both military and sports settings increase, evidence-based treatments and targeted suicide prevention strategies will hopefully emerge.

AB - African American Youth's Perceptions Of Cooperative Competition Sports by Rose Dunn MS, Walden University , 2008 BS, Baruch College, 1989 Dissertation Submitted in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy Public Health Walden University November, 2012 Abstract Inadequate physical activity has contributed to overweight, obesity and resulting chronic diseases among African American youth. This study sought to determine how 10 African American children (6 boys and 4 girls) who participated in cooperative competition (CC) perceived the program. Two motivational theories were used to guide the study: Harter's competence motivation theory, and, Azjen and Fishbein's theory of reasoned action/planned behavior. The research questions focused on whether African American children enjoyed CC sports, felt competent at physical activity, and had a positive attitude towards physical activity. A qualitative study was conducted using grounded theory approach. Data consisting of observations and answers to interview questions were analyzed using coding and constant comparison. Triangulation of the data which emanated from interviews, and observations supported the emergent theories of rewards and peer support contributing to skill building, perception of competence, enjoyment of physical activity and willingness to continue to participate in organized sports. It is recommended that program planners and coaches consider components of CC when planning physical activity programs for African American youth. Implications for positive social change included increases in physical activity which can lead to reduced prevalence of overweight, obesity, and their comorbidities. Such reductions can result in improved mental and physical health among African American youth. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Injured athletes, in general, are subject to a unique set of stressors and require additional considerations when approached in a clinical setting. Injured adolescent-young adult (AYA) athletes endure a particularly unique injury and recovery experience within sport context due to the increased interaction with individuals outside of the family and the socially-driven developmental tasks of this age group. The primary objective of this project was to detail the injury and recovery process as well as unique stressors experienced by the injured AYA athlete. This project also focused on the historical and current socioculture of sport and how it improves or impairs the athlete's injury and recovery process. The comprehensive literature review and professional interviews discussed individual and situational factors which contribute to the athlete's experience of injury and also identified suggested treatment guidelines and interventions. This project also includes a professional brochure (Appendix B) designed to assist mental health professionals with clinically treatment of injured AYA athletes and also bring attention to the positive and negative impacts of the sporting culture.

AB - Emotional Intelligence (EI) has received recognition in education, health, business, and recently sport. Yet, after 2 decades, there is little consensus over its definition and measurement (Zeidner et al., 2008). Some describe EI as a set of abilities and form of intelligence (Mayer & Salovey, 1997), while others conceptualize EI as a mixture of abilities and personality (Bar-On, 1997; Goleman, 1995). The limited research in sport has examined EI and its connection to a variety of performance-related outcomes, using measures developed from each of the two theories mentioned. While EI has been tied to performance outcomes, it may be that athletes' use of mental skills mediates the relationship between EI and performance. The primary purpose of this study was to examine the association between performance-based EI and use of mental skills. A secondary purpose of this study was to explore the extent to which gender and sport moderate the relationship between EI and mental skills use. Performance-based EI was measured using the online version of the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT: Mayer, Salovey, & Caruso, 2002), while mental skill use was measured using the Test of Performance Strategies (TOPS: Thomas, Murphy, & Hardy, 1999). Participants included 67 male and female Division III athletes from intact teams in baseball, softball, tennis and swimming. Relationships between the MSCEIT (and its subscales) and the TOPS (and its subscales) were examined. In addition, the extent to which athletes' gender and sport moderated the relationship between their EI and mental skill use was explored. Analyses revealed that there were no significant, positive relationships between EI and mental skill use totals or at the subscale level. On the contrary, one significant, negative relationship was found between the facilitating emotions branch of the MSCEIT and goal setting in practice. However, the main findings of this study centered on the low internal reliability of two branches of the MSCEIT. Results suggest that more research needs be done with a larger sample size to assess the reliability of using the MSCEIT with an athlete population before further studies are conducted in this area.

AB - Self-talk is a mental skill solicited in everyday life as well as in sports to enhance performance. Often this self-talk is instructional or motivational in nature. Self-talk research has support athletes using it during sport performance but this quantitative study was designed to understand more about its use during injury recovery. The target of this study was quantify self-talk before and after an injury as well as look at coping strategies utilized during sport injury recovery. Self-Talk was quantified pre and post injury using the Self-Talk Use Questionnaire (STUQ) (Hardy, 2004). Participants included 82 pre injury student athletes from four-year universities competing at the NCAA and NAIA level. Student athletes competing in a variety of team and individual sports were then eligible to complete the study if they had been injured and out of competition for a least one-week or more. 23 student athletes completed the post injury STUQ and the Brief COPE Inventory (Carver, 1997). Findings showed that there was increased use of self-talk pre-injury and that females used increased negative self-talk pre injury and higher positive self-talk post injury compared to male student athletes. The purpose of self-talk was for motivation during the pre injury and shifted to more instructional nature during the post injury. Athletes that injured their ankles and were treated with a cast reported the highest rates of self-talk during post injury. A weak correlation was found between injury severity and self-talk use. Student athletes with severe injuries also reported the most frequent endorsement of 12 of the subscales of coping including seeking social support, planning and acceptance of the injury. This study, focusing on athletes recovering from injury, offers greater insight into the athletic experience of being injured and how to incorporate an athlete's propensity for self-talk and coping into psychological interventions coinciding with physical rehabilitation.

AB - This is a qualitative study on the Filipino athlete's experience of the bahala na attitude in international sporting competition. Bahala na translates literally as "leave it up to God" and is used as an expression almost universally in Filipino culture. Filipinos engage in the bahala na attitude when faced with challenging situations. Eleven Filipino athletes who have participated in an international sporting competition participated in a semi-structured interview, and the conventional qualitative content analysis was utilized to analyze the data. The study found that Filipino athletes experienced and utilized the bahala na attitude in sports and in other contexts. The common themes that emerged among the participants' description of their bahala na experience were: Bahala na as adaptive attitudinal coping with significant challenges, performance pressure as prompting context for bahala na, bahala na as an automatic response to routine stress, bahala na as problematic effort reduction, use of bahala na as a source of performance learning, and preparation obviating need for bahala na. The discussion concentrated on the bahala na attitude as a culture-influenced coping strategy for performance anxiety and to manage expectations and situational demands in sports and in similar contexts. Clinical implications and directions for future research are also discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - The authors aimed to investigate the effects of different sporting experience on nonspecific temporal preparation. They evaluated temporal preparation in tennis players (an open-skill sport) and their athletic (swimmers, a closed skill-sport) and nonathletic (sedentary students) controls using a go/no-go variable foreperiod paradigm in which one simple condition and two go/no-go conditions (central-go and mixed-go) were included, which can be used to study the temporal aspects of nonspecific preparation with decision making in inhibition with different levels of cognitive load. Tennis players responded faster than nonathletic controls while there was no significant difference relative to the athletic controls. Additionally, the main finding of the present study is that the difference in reaction time between tennis players and nonathletic controls was found selectively for short foreperiods in which temporal uncertainty is higher and less temporal preparation can occur. Moreover, correlation analysis revealed that superior temporal preparation was positively associated with enhanced go/no-go decision making in the higher difficulty condition. Our findings are consistent with tennis players showing superior temporal processing. The absence of a significant effect in athletic controls suggests that there is a specific benefit from tennis training and indicates that temporal preparation may be susceptible to modulation by fitness and appropriate training.

AB - The purpose of this study was first, checking the psychometric properties of the Sports Performance Psychological Inventory (IPED) and secondly, to know the strengths and weaknesses of competitive psychological profile of calm water paddlers based on sex, age and number of weekly workouts. We used the Spanish version of IPED (Hernandez, 2006) arising from the Psychological Performance Inventory (PPI) of Loehr (1982, 1986, 1990). The participants in the Study were 258 federated paddlers aged between 14 and 65. The results show that the Castilian version of the instrument used demonstrated acceptable validity and reliability in the sample of canoeists. These athletes reflect a psychological profile that is characterized by a high motivational level. The study confirms the existence of significant differences in gender and age of the participants and the number of workouts per week.

AB - This book looks at the problem of why so many professional and amateur athletes kill themselves. Professional athletes lead what seem to us to be glamorous lives and make large, and sometimes huge, salaries. In schools, the athletes are often the formal and informal leaders, given recognition and honors. News of their suicides shocks us because, to the rest of us, these are the successful members of our society, often looked up to as heroes and role models. The book, therefore, explores the incidence of suicide in athletes and reviews the risk factors that increase the likelihood of suicide in athletes. Research on these risk factors, such as the role of steroids and concussions, is reviewed, and case studies are provided to illustrate these risk factors. Some of the topics include: suicide in baseball and cricket; how steroids is often linked to suicide, as well as concussion and traumatic brain injury; how social relationships of athletes, including suicide among lesbian, gay and bisexual athletes, and sexual abuse, can lead to suicide; suicide as a result of bullying among high school and college athletes and suicide contagion; how spectators" involvement in sports can be related to suicide; and the effect of retirement on athletes, psychiatric problems among athletes, and how substance abuse among athletes can cause suicide, along with many other topics. The book concludes with ways in which suicide might be prevented in athletes. It will be of great interest to crisis workers and those who work in crisis centers as well as suicidologists, mental health workers and others interested in the topic.

AB - Welcome to this, the second edition of Pure Sport , and the journey through the world of sport psychology that it offers. Before setting off, maybe it's worthwhile laying a few ghosts to rest. First of all, even if you've never heard of sport psychology before, or never met a sport psychologist, make no mistake you will have come across sport psychology. The reason why is because sport psychology is all about the countless ways that the mind influences our performance. Sometimes these effects are obvious and sometimes they are subtle. Sometimes they are planned and sometimes they pop up out of the blue. Sometimes they have a minor impact on how you play and sometimes they can make you despair as to why you ever play at all. In so many ways it is impossible to ignore the massive influence that our minds have on the way our body performs. Without knowing it, throughout your life a great many people, including yourself, will have been practising a version of sport psychology on you. We are sure that all of us, from our schooldays onwards, can remember those times when a few ill-chosen words, or negative thoughts, took their toll on performance or belief. If you play, watch or manage sport, it is impossible to ignore the influence of the mind on sporting endeavour-but does it have to be haphazard and random? The answer is no. Our goal in Pure Sport is simple. It is to help you to use the mental side of sport to your advantage and thereby allow you to explore your true sporting potential.

AB - Individual differences at the psychological level make each athlete unique. They are useful for explaining and predicting behaviour and performance. Acquiring a comprehensive understanding of individual differences in sport would help to consider each athlete with his/her own particularities, to understand him/her better, in order to help him/her to reach a higher performance. In this chapter, we will discuss which personality-trait-like individual differences are of main importance in sports, and how they might affect performance. Mental toughness, perfectionism, emotional intelligence and hardiness are such individual differences linked to personality, which were found in recent scientific studies to predict athletes' performance. Theories about individual differences will be presented, showing how they can be used in applied settings. Advice will thus be given to coaches, in order to encourage them to treat each athlete independently, individualising training and establishing a specific relationship with each athlete. The importance of considering individual differences when running experiments is also discussed, showing how sport researchers can integrate them into their design in order to reach a better comprehension of their object. Finally, we aim to conclude this chapter with some stimulating thoughts about the role of individual differences in sports: are we genetically determined at the level of individual differences, or is there a way to change them? How can they be integrated into training? We hope this reflection will highlight the fact that each athlete is unique, and, therefore, deserves individualised attention in order to reach peak performance.

AB - This chapter discusses career transitions of athletes in China. The wisdom of the ancient Chinese has had a great impact on Chinese traditional sport and sports culture. In traditional Chinese culture the harmonious relationship between human beings and nature was highly valued, providing a foundation for the development of character and ethics. As a result, unlike other countries, Chinese people try to comply with the laws of nature in sports. the 19th century, modem sports began to be introduced to China, which brought about profound changes in Chinese people's understanding of sport. Competitive sports in China experienced a great leap after the foundation of the People's Republic of China as many resources from the whole nation could be gathered to support athletic trainings and competitions. Sport psychology in Chinahas primarily focused on the psychological characteristics of high-level athletes, talents selection, mental training and coach training. Recently, a review was carried out on sport and exercise psychology studies in China conducted between 2008 and 2011. In total, 421 published research papers were reviewed, within 15 core Chinese sport science journals and nine core Chinese psychology journals. Among the main research domains, that is, competitive sports, exercise and physical education, literature on competitive sports occupies 48.5 per cent of all publications. There are seven studies on athletic career, accounting for 1.66 per cent of the indexed literature. Target populations in sport and exercise psychology studies include athletes, college student-athletes, teachers, coaches and sports managers.

AB - Engaging in and maintaining a physical activity program is important for mental and physical well-being (Marcus et al., 2000; Powell, Paluch and Blair, 2011). Prior research has shown that interventions designed to increase people's physical activity produce moderate effects, but mostly short-term improvements (Kahn et al., 2002). About 50 percent of individuals who are inactive and start a physical activity program drop back to their prior physical inactivity (drop-out) after six months (Bock, Marcus, Pinto and Forsyth, 2001). One reason is that physical inactivity is most often habitual. Breaking inactive behavior habits may be accompanied by difficulties and negative experiences. Therefore, taking a closer look at the individual differences in dealing with negative experiences could improve our knowledge about the behavioral change processes and the maintenance of physical activity. With this short communication, we will give an introduction into the habit concept, followed by a short summary of the difficulties and consequences of breaking habitual physical inactivity. This leads to the theory of learned optimism (Seligman, 1991), which hypothesizes that the way people explain negative occurrences is important for their following behavior. We end with a synopsis and some future prospects. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)

AB - This chapter discusses career transition of athletes in Germany. In Germany, competitive sport is organized by clubs and federations, most of which are non-profit organizations and earn their money from membership fees and some public contributions. Young athletes who are scouted as talents are educated in special schools and/or special training groups. Financial support for these athletes is primarily given by the parents. Student-athletes get some instrumental support from their universities and a limited number of senior athletes get financial support through contracts with federal agencies, i.e. the federal police, the army and federal customs. In addition, elite-level adult athletes are eligible for grants that are distributed by foundations. All these efforts are focused mainly on providing instrumental rather than psychological support for athletes. The systematic psychological support of young athletes only starts at the junior level and is regularly offered to elite athletes of adult age at the Olympic Training Centers (OTCs). Currently, more and more federations are discovering the importance of psychological skills training for high performance. Coordinated efforts are being made by some federations to improve the mental skills of their athletes, for example in swimming and diving. But much more needs to be done. In particular, psychological programs and consultation should be offered on a regular basis not only to adult athletes, but also to young ones. The challenge of the future will be to support athletes from the beginning of their sport career not only instrumentally, but also psychologically. This will help more athletes to reach their goals and to make it to the top. Besides psychological skills training for performance enhancement, OTCs offer assistance in career planning during and shortly after the athletic career.

AB - Correspondence analysis is a multivariate statistical technique for visualizing and describing the associations between two or more variables. It is particularly applicable to a table of categorical data—for example, counts or percentages—but can also be used to visualize non-negative data on a common ratio scale, such as a table of measurements all in centimeters or all in euros. Its main objective is to represent the rows and columns of a data matrix as points in a spatial representation, called a map or a biplot according to the coordinates chosen. The positions of the points suggest and facilitate interpretations of the data content. The method resembles principal component analysis but distinguishes itself by the way distances are measured between points, adapted to categorical data, and by the differential weighting of rows and columns proportional to their marginal sums in the table. Extensions of correspondence analysis are multiple correspondence analysis (for multivariate categorical data) and canonical correspondence analysis (when an additional set of external explanatory variables is available).

AB - Many studies have shown that a strong link exists between health status and physical activity, sports activities, and level of fitness. The perception that involvement in physical activity and sports is a protective factor against stress, depression, and other behaviors (notably risk taking and drug use) is spreading among health professionals and policy makers (Ferron, Narring, Cauderay, & Michaud, 1999). Several mechanisms have been hypothesized to account for this link. Biochemical mechanisms involving the release of endorphins and increased serotonin and norepinephrine synthesis have been suggested. Exercise may reduce emotional strain and serve as a buffer against stressful events, and in addition, participation in regular physical exercise programs may convey a sense of mastery and increased self-esteem. Participation in sports and exercise groups may also provide social interaction and promote social support (Sagatun, Sogaard, Bjertbess, Selmer, & Heyerdahl, 2007). However, in recent years, studies have also focused on the possibility that physical activity may be not only a protective factor for mental disorder and suicide risk but also a risk factor. In fact, elevated physical activity is characteristic of bipolar patients, and bipolar patients have a high risk of suicide (Pompili et al., 2009; Rihmer, 2005). The present chapter reviews research on the link between physical activity and involvement in sports and suicidality, using a literature search in PubMed® and Psyclnfo®.

AB - This chapter reviews career research and assistance in Soviet/Russian sport psychology by casting the spotlight on historical key events such as the Olympic debut of the 1952 Soviet team in Helsinki, the 1980 Olympics in Moscow, the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the-formation of the Russian Federation, and the hosting of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. The successful debut of the Soviet Olympic team in the 1952 Summer Olympic Games stimulated the Communist Soviet government's efforts to exploit success in sports in the ideological battle of socialist against capitalist society. As a result, substantial investments were made in sport, coaching education and sports sciences with the directive to establish a high international reputation for Soviet sport. In the 1950s and 1960s, Soviet sport psychologists focused on the psychological aspects of physical, technical and tactical preparation in sport, the volitional and ideological preparation of athletes, and psychological preparation for competitions. Hosting the 1980 Olympics in Moscow raised the development of sport and sport psychology in the Soviet Union to new heights. Preparation for the Moscow Olympics was also highlighted as a political and social event due to the United States team's boycott of the Games. The success of Soviet athletes in the 1980 Olympics followed by the boycott of the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles by socialist countries, kept elite Soviet athletes at the center of public attention throughout the 1980s.

AB - Classic developmental theory suggests that aging is associated with using compensatory strategies to prolong independence. While compensatory strategies are typically considered positive adaptations, they also signify an early phase in the disablement process—commonly known as pre-clinical disability. To build a better understanding of psychological constructs related to these early signs of disability, we examined the contribution of SE and state anxiety on using compensatory strategies among pre-clinically disabled older adults. Compensatory strategies were observed during performance of daily activities in 257 pre-clinically disabled older adults (67.6 ± 7.04), and SE and state anxiety were evaluated prior to performing each task. In univariate models, lower SE and higher anxiety were associated with more compensation (Spearman correlations: 0.15–0.48, p < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression indicated that low SE [Odds Ratio (OR): 1.70; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.40–2.08) and high anxiety (OR: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.10–1.63) were positively associated with using ≥ 6 compensatory strategies – a level signifying substantial compensation. When considered jointly with SE, the association with anxiety was reversed—higher anxiety demonstrated a lower likelihood of using compensation (OR: 0.70–0.73; 95% CI: 0.50–0.99). The addition of SE might remove the self-defeating cognitions characterizing anxiety allowing the remaining arousal component to appear beneficial. In conclusion, lower SE and higher anxiety are associated with using compensation to complete daily tasks among pre-clinically disabled older adults. Such psychological constructs may contribute to the use of compensatory strategies and represent future intervention targets to help reduce early signs of disability.

AB - This article uses preparations surrounding the 2010 Winter Olympic Games as an opportunity to examine the idea and practice of resiliency in the field of security, public safety, and urban governance. The enthusiasm for resiliency today is said to connect with broader shifts in the logics of security in response to the proliferation of disruptive events that are difficult to anticipate and potentially catastrophic in impact. How, though, is it possible to plan for an unknown and unknowable future? This article outlines three sets of practices for building urban resiliency that, while seemingly routine and mundane, and associated primarily with the domain of emergency management, exemplify a field of governmental activity that has flourished after 9/11 but received little scholarly attention to date.

AB - Background: Despite considerable investment in UK government initiatives (e.g., the Physical Education School Sport [PESS] plan) aimed at improving the delivery and quality of physical education (PE) in primary schools, many remaining problems have been highlighted (e.g., facilities; staff training). It is suggested that the head teacher (school principal) plays a fundamental role in the experience of PE delivery within their schools as well as the effective implementation of government initiatives (e.g., PESS) that aim to enhance the quality of PE within primary schools. However, this role has been previously overlooked in the literature. Purpose: This study offers an in-depth examination of the challenges faced by primary school head teachers in effectively creating and managing an environment that supports high quality PE and school sport. The study also explores the head teachers’ perceptions of the challenges caused by the implementation of the PESS plan within their school. Participants: 14 head teachers of primary schools located in the same local authority agreed to participate in the study through the provision of informed consent. The participants ranged in age from 45 to 61 years, had held their position between 6 and 10 years, and included 5 males and 9 females. Research design: A qualitative approach using a semi-structured interview design was employed. Data collection: Participants were sent an interview preparation booklet one week prior to their individual interview date in an attempt to aid memory recall and improve the flow of the interview. During the interview itself, participants were guided through a semi-structured interview process that consisted of six sections but remained flexible in attempts to enhance the depth and quality of data collection. Data analysis: A combination of both inductive and deductive content analysis procedures were applied to each interview transcript with trustworthiness characteristics being considered throughout the analysis procedures via thick description, the recording and transcribing of all interviews, triangulation, peer debriefing, and member checking. Findings: The participants reported a number of issues relating to the provision of high quality PE including: (a) school policies; (b) the curriculum; (c) extra-curriculum provision; and (d) resources and finance. Participants also acknowledged the challenge of implementing and managing the PESS plan and outlined some initial problems with the initiative. Benefits of the PESS initiative in raising the standards of PE delivery were also reported. Conclusions: The head teacher faces many challenges when it comes to creating and managing an environment that supports high quality PE provision. Although some aspects of these challenges are out of the control of the head teacher (e.g., government targets; access to facilities), it would appear clear that a commitment to PE provision by head teachers would result in greater strategic planning and use of resources to support their staff in implementing PE policy. Consequently, the role of the head teacher in ensuring a specific policy is developed for PE that considers the wider targets of government PE initiatives and that encourages the development of effective, high quality PE cannot be underestimated.

AB - Quadrennial in nature, multisport in character, bringing together several thousands athletes and coaches for highly mediatized elite level competitions within a period of only two weeks, the Olympic Games certainly are regarded by many as being the pinnacle of an athletic career. In fact, the Olympic Games are perceived to be so unique that they are seen as probably the most challenging and prestigious competition for athletes. In order to make it to the Olympic Games and to perform at their best athletes, teams and coaches face many challenges and needs that are psychological and psychosocial in nature. Illustrations of the diversity of these challenges and of their significance to athletes are of course presented in media reports on Olympic performances. This special issue on sport psychology and the Olympic Games presents a number of high quality articles. This special issue also contains a short article in which Wylleman, Reints, and van Aken investigate the challenges perceived by four first-time Olympic athletes in preparation for, during and after the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. As guest-editors, we would like to thank both current and past Psychology of Sport and Exercise ( PSE ) editors-in-chief for supporting us in the development of this special issue. A big thank you of course goes out to the authors of the different contributions in this special issue. We are also indebted to the 16 colleagues who provided excellent and timely reviews. We hope that this special issue will support the ongoing development and optimization of ASP support to Olympic athletes, teams and coaches.

AB - Objectives: Taking into account the need for applied research on the most effective ways to prepare Olympians psychologically, the first purpose of this study was to gain more insight into the changes perceived by four athletes in view of their participation in the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. The second purpose of this study was to illustrate how using a holistic and dynamic approach to the identification of the perceptions of these athletes' Olympic experiences can provide information relevant for the provision of individual ASP support to these athletes. Design: Using a prospective design athletes' perceptions of changes were gathered prior, during as well as after the Olympic Games. Methods: A combination of interview (pre and post Olympic Games) and self-reporting (during Olympic Games) was used to describe athletes' perceptions of changes occurring at athletic, psychological, psychosocial, academic/vocational level. Results: Results confirmed in first instance athletes' perceptions of the multifaceted nature of their Olympic experience. In second instance, the use of a dynamic and holistic perspective allowed to identify that participants perceived (a) during the phase prior to the Olympic Games 14 changes at all four levels, (b) during the Olympic Games eight changes at three levels, and (c) during the phase after returning from the Olympic Games 11 changes having occurred at four levels. Conclusions: This study showed the usefulness of using a dynamic and holistic perspective not only in order to identify athletes' perceptions of their Olympic experiences, but also to enhance ASP practitioners' knowledge on the needs for a holistic and dynamic ASP-support provision. In this way, the effectiveness and efficiency of ASP practitioners working with athletes preparing for, or competing at the Olympic Games could be enhanced.

AB - Objectives: A multi-action plan (MAP) intervention model has been applied to the Italian shooting team in preparation for the London 2012 Olympics to help athletes improve, stabilise, and optimise their performances during practice and competition. Design: A longitudinal design was adopted to assess the intervention effects over two years. Methods: Fifteen participants, two female and three male carbine shooters, and five female and five male pistol shooters, took part in the study. First, shooters were requested to accurately and extensively describe their usually optimal sequence of actions for the execution of a single shot from start to follow-through. Second, shooters were asked to identify a small number of the most important core components(three or four) deemed fundamental to optimal performance. Third, performers were engaged in several shooting sessions and asked to assess themselves by rating the quality of each core component. Finally,the most influential core components were further assessed under conditions of increased distress and simulated competition. Results: Core component ratings were linked to shooting scores classified as optimal or suboptimal. The probability levels of optimal/suboptimal performance associated with the core component ratings were derived using logistical ordinal regression analysis. The full links among core component scores and the full range of shooting scores were also examined through path analysis. Conclusions: Findings highlighted the benefits of using the MAP intervention model in the preparation of elite level shooters.

AB - In this article we reviewed a series of studies ( n = 18) on psychological preparation of the goalkeeper (GK) for the 11-m penalty kick in soccer. The main findings of this review were that deception strategies (e.g., standing slightly off-center) can increase the chances of the kick being directed to a desired direction, and that individual differences among GKs should be considered when planning sport psychology programs for GKs. A number of research limitations and methodological concerns, such as the lack of ecological validity of the tasks performed in the studies and the lack of studies on psychological interventions, were discussed. In addition, a number of practical implications for sport psychology consultants who work with GKs in soccer were suggested.

AB - The aim of the current study was to facilitate systematic reflection and action to improve the performance environment of a soccer team during a competitive season. Using the Performance Environment Survey (PES; Pain & Harwood, 2007) as a diagnostic instrument, the researcher worked with the coach to collaboratively identify areas in which team preparation and functioning could be improved. Completed by the players and coach after each match, the PES captured feedback around team preparation and performance in the physical, psychological, coaching, social, planning/organizational and environmental domains. Analysis of this feedback provided the stimulus for weekly discussions with the coach. Results suggested that coach and player reflection increased during the study, and the coach reported that the PES data and his reflections on that data were beneficial to managing the performance environment. In areas where change was targeted—in particular the social and the phaysical domains—improvements in team functioning were reported. Team feedback meetings were also perceived as helpful to improving player ownership and cohesiveness. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - Recording cognitions in real-time while running has been identified as one of the major limitations in the field of sport psychology. In this study, a new methodology was developed to overcome this limitation. For this purpose, 17 competitive long distance runners participated voluntarily. The experimental session consisted in identifying and storing cognitions (thoughts, emotions, sensations and mental images) while performing a 30 minutes treadmill run. In addition, participants were asked to register which of these cognitions were perceived as unpleasant. The mapping task showed a total of 1154 cognitions recorded, mostly thoughts. In general, during the session, cognitions perceived as unpleasant represented 13.43% of the total recorded. These cognitions were mainly directed to physical sensations that resulted from stimulations derived from the physical effort of running. Consequently, it is possible to claim an interaction relationship between sensations and exercise workload. The results attempt to demonstrate that the study of cognitions in real-time is deemed suitable during running. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - Objective: Previous studies focused on investigating the separate effects of anxiety, cognitive load, and expertise on perceptual-motor performance, but the combined effects of these factors have not been studied yet. The objective of the current study was to investigate these factors in combination. Design: Eleven expert dart players and nine novices performed a dart throwing task in low-anxiety (LA) and high-anxiety (HA) conditions with and without a secondary task. Method: To manipulate anxiety the dart throwing task was performed low (LA) and high (HA) on a climbing wall with and without the secondary counting backwards task. Performance and efficiency of task execution and gaze behavior were assessed. Results: The anxiety manipulation evoked a decrease in dart performance, but only for the novices. Increases in mental effort and dart times and a decrease in response rate on the secondary task were observed for both groups. This shows that there were decreases in processing efficiency with anxiety. Most important, the anxiety-induced decrease in performance for the novices was accompanied by final fixations on the target that were substantially shorter and deviated off the target earlier. The dual task did not affect performance. Conclusion: Anxiety affects efficiency and sometimes performance in far aiming tasks. Changes are accompanied by changes in gaze behavior, particularly the final fixation on the target. All in all, findings provide support for Attentional Control Theory as a suitable framework to explain the effects of anxiety, a cognitive secondary task, and expertise in far aiming tasks.

AB - In this article I focus on intersections between the National Football League’s (NFL) security practices and the US Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) counter-terrorism agenda, including new policies and legal structures that support pre-emption, protection, and preparation activities that manage and mitigate the effects of terrorist attacks. As I will argue, the intensifying and mutually supportive relationship between the NFL and the various forces employed to keep it safe is both unique in US sports and implies the militarization of football fans in somewhat unexpected ways. I will argue that the security strategies of the US government and those of the NFL are mutually beneficial in ways that help secure the NFL’s position and profitability and, more importantly, help implement and secure consensus for the US Department of Homeland Security's continued ‘war on terror’. Coaffee’s recent work on urban resilience in the UK (Coaffee, 2009; Coaffee and Wood, 2006) contends that in the present historical moment, ‘security is becoming more civic, urban, domestic, and personal’ (Coaffee, 2009: 9). How, if at all, does resilience play out in the context of anti-terrorism policy in post-9/11 America? How, if at all, does US professional football articulate with that policy? These are two key questions I intend to address during the course of this article. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - In preparation for the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympic Games, the lead author engaged in systematic reflection in an attempt to implement coaching behaviours and create practice environments that promoted athlete development (psycho-social and physical performance). The research was carried out in relation to his work as head Ski Cross coach working with (primarily) three athletes in their quest for Olympic qualification and subsequent performance success in the Olympic Games. This project sought to examine coach-athlete interactions. Of particular interest were coach and athlete responses regarding the implementation of autonomy supportive coaching behaviours in a high context. Autonomy supportive coaching behaviours have previously been strongly associated with positive athlete psycho-social and performance outcomes, however, a paucity of research has examined its implementation in high-performance contexts. Through the use of participant ethnography, it was possible to gain considerable insights regarding athletes’ perceptions of choice, implications of perceived athletic hierarchies, as well as cultural and experience-related influences on training and performance expectations.

AB - This paper explores the complexity of developing decision-making skills in elite netball. Using the attacking centre pass as a theme, we present a framework designed to develop decision-making capabilities of the coach, performers and the players collectively as a team. The paper exemplifies the integration of reflective practice principles into coaching strategies, as the cyclic link between the ‘off-court’ slow deliberate environment and the ‘on-court’ applied performance environment. Using a five-stage framework adapted from field hockey, we describe various reflective mechanisms which can be used and incorporated into coaching strategies to develop effective team decision making. The paper utilises a period of preparation from a world cup programme to demonstrate how a coach can empower players individually and collectively as a team to reflect ‘on-action’ which, in turn, facilitates the coach, players and team ‘reflecting-for-action’ and ultimately ‘in-action’.

AB - The present article outlines the development and implementation of a multifaceted psychological skills training program for the Canadian National Short Track Speedskating team over a 3-year period leading up to the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Games. A program approach was used emphasizing a seven-phase model in an effort to enhance sport performance (Thomas, 1990) in which psychological skills training was integrated with biofeedback training to optimize self-regulation for performance on demand and under pressure. The biofeedback training protocols were adapted from general guidelines described by Wilson, Peper, and Moss (2006) who built on the work of DeMichelis (2007) and the “Mind Room” program approach for enhancing athletic performance. The goal of the program was to prepare the athletes for their best performance under the pressure of the Olympic Games. While causation cannot be implied due to the lack of a control group, the team demonstrated success on both team and individual levels.

AB - Multiple conceptual frameworks support the link between coaches’ attitudes and behaviors, and their effect on a variety of athlete outcomes, such as performance, motivation, and athlete self-perceptions. The present study explored the relationships among coaches’ attitudes and behaviors, with respect to psychological skills training (PST), and the beliefs of their athletes. One hundred and fifteen coaches completed PST attitude (SPA-RC-revised) and behavior measures, while 403 athletes completed two perception measures (CCS and SCI). Structural Equation Modeling showed that the proposed relationships were statistically significant, except for the pathway between coaches’ attitudes and their behaviors. Results support the disconnect between coaches’ attitudes and behaviors previously established in PST research, as well as the theoretical links between coaches’ behaviors and athletes’ perceptions (i.e., evaluation of their coach and self-confidence).

AB - Reviews the book, Routledge Handbook of Applied Sport Psychology; A Comprehensive Guide for Students and Practicioners edited by Stephanie J. Hanrahan & Mark B. Andersen (2010). With this book, the editors present a model of applied practice that seeks consilience by linking together principles from counseling, assessment, therapeutic models, and traditional mental skills training. By emphasizing the importance of establishing therapeutic relationships between sport psychology practitioners and their clients, they are attempting to make applied sport psychology more "psychological". The editors make the point that if it is the athlete’s agenda to learn mental skills for performance, then it is appropriate to follow the athlete’s lead and address performance concerns. Most of the chapters deftly summarize state-of-the-science research, while emphasizing practical application through the use of vignettes, case studies, and examples. This Handbook also passes the "highlighter test" as there were numerous points and passages in my copy of the text that deserved highlighting. Overall, this book is an admirable step forward in the evolution of applied sport psychology. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - The authors review the historical context of sport psychology to explore the present state of sport psychology and make suggestions for the future of the field. The origins of sport psychology are rooted in efforts to improve athletic performance. However, the label “sport psychology” has been used to describe two different service delivery models: performance enhancement and therapy with athletes. Presently, advancements have been made in terms of organizational structure, but there has been little impact on the applied profession. In order to advance the profession, protect the public, and resolve confusion, sport psychology is examined. The authors identify performance excellence as the unique aspect of sport psychology and propose the field be identified as “performance psychology.” In order to practice performance psychology competently, four areas of training are identified: (a) performance excellence, (b) mental health counseling, (c) consulting psychology, and (d) performance specialty domain(s). Finally, the authors recommend that a licensure specific to performance psychology be developed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - Background: It is unclear whether and how elite athletes process physiological or psychological challenges differently than healthy comparison subjects. In general, individuals optimize exercise level as it relates to differences between expected and experienced exertion, which can be conceptualized as a body prediction error. The process of computing a body prediction error involves the insular cortex, which is important for interoception, i.e. the sense of the physiological condition of the body. Thus, optimal performance may be related to efficient minimization of the body prediction error. We examined the hypothesis that elite athletes, compared to control subjects, show attenuated insular cortex activation during an aversive interoceptive challenge. Methodology/Principal Findings: Elite adventure racers (n = 10) and healthy volunteers (n = 11) performed a continuous performance task with varying degrees of a non-hypercapnic breathing load while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. The results indicate that (1) non-hypercapnic inspiratory breathing load is an aversive experience associated with a profound activation of a distributed set of brain areas including bilateral insula, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulated; (2) adventure racers relative to comparison subjects show greater accuracy on the continuous performance task during the aversive interoceptive condition; and (3) adventure racers show an attenuated right insula cortex response during and following the aversive interoceptive condition of non-hypercapnic inspiratory breathing load. Conclusions/Significance: These findings support the hypothesis that elite athletes during an aversive interoceptive condition show better performance and an attenuated insular cortex activation during the aversive experience. Interestingly, differential modulation of the right insular cortex has been found previously in elite military personnel and appears to be emerging as an important brain system for optimal performance in extreme environments.

AB - Research on flow (Csikszentmihalyi, 1975) has traditionally focused on reactive, externally-paced sports (e.g., tennis) without exploring those that are self-paced and stop-start in nature. This study investigated the occurrence of flow in a sample of thirteen elite golfers by conducting semi-structured interviews discussing: (i) their experiences of flow, (ii) factors that influenced flow occurrence, and (iii) the controllability of these experiences. Results shared similarity with existing research in terms of the majority of influencing factors reported, including motivation, preparation, focus, psychological state, environmental and situational conditions, and arousal, and that flow was reported to be at least potentially controllable. Golf-specific influences were also noted, including pre-shot routines, use of psychological interventions, standard of performance, and maintenance of physical state, suggesting that flow may have occurred differently for this sample. Findings are discussed and applied recommendations are made that may help golfers put relevant factors in place to increase the likelihood of experiencing flow.

AB - This paper summarizes some of the results obtained by our group at the Institute of Physiology in Siena where, in the 1970s, Giancarlo Carli founded the School of Sports Medicine. Carli inculcated a deep interest in the relation between cognition and physical activity in students and colleagues. The main focus of our work were the cognitive factors able to influence sport performance, their neurophysiological correlates, the effects of physical and mental training on performance, and the relation between nutrition and physical/cognitive activity. We have shown that: (a) training reduces reaction times, errors, and variability in the performance of attentional tasks; (b) the characteristics of the motor action and of the related motor cortex potential is modified by both physical and mental imagery training; (c) dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids and policosanols improves reactivity and attention, modifies the profile of mood states, and induces changes in the cerebral activity associated with motor action, similar to those observed after physical training; and (d) the glycaemic index of foods is associated with specific levels of cognitive performance relevant to physical activity. We are grateful to Professor Carli to have oriented our interests, encouraged our research, and helped us with his enthusiasm and criticism.

AB - Binder (1999) suggested that interactive, multimedia-training activities could be used to fill the gap between coursework and supervised practicum experiences. Consistent with this idea, the purpose of the present study was to evaluate a computer-training program that combines case-based instruction, self-evaluation, and models as feedback. Case-based instruction gives learners practice with applying their knowledge in real-world situations (Mayo, 2002), situating the learning in the context in which it will be used (Williams, 1992). Thus, learners become more flexible and effective in transferring and applying their knowledge in a variety of situations, and are better able to build adaptive expertise. Adaptive experts are more effectively able to think and act flexibly and appropriately, handle uncertainty, and build understandings for new experiences (Fazey, Fazey, & Fazey, 2005). Thirty-four sport psychology graduate students participated in the study, and responded to four sets of two performance-consulting scenarios. Participants outlined for each scenario the additional information they would want in the situation, and how they might handle the situation. Half of the participants then viewed other sport psychology graduate students’ responses, while the other half viewed experienced professionals’ responses. Participants were also assessed on their self-efficacy before and after viewing the models and ratings of comparisons with the models. Participants were subsequently asked to comment on the usefulness of the program and the models. The results of the study provided only limited support for the idea that viewing experienced professionals’ models would be more beneficial to learning, though there was evidence of potential trends for their usefulness, particularly with respect to the participants’ written responses. This is important given that individuals with more knowledge in a domain have more elaborate mental representations, which over time enable them to develop situation awareness and adaptive expertise, resulting in more flexible and effective application of their knowledge to a wide variety of situations (Berliner, 1994; Endsley, 1995; Ericsson, 2003; Glaser, 1987; Hatano & Inagaki, 2005; Tan, 1997). Self-efficacy ratings overall did not depend on which models were viewed, but rather may be based on the previous backgrounds and experiences of the participants. Model comparison ratings also did not depend on which models were viewed, which may be due to the design of the program rather than an indication of a lack of learning. However, the results highlighted a potential trend that participants in the novice feedback group rated their responses as more comparable to the models than did participants in the expert feedback group. Overall, participants indicated that the program would be a useful addition to performance consulting training, and stated that the models, regardless of level, were a beneficial aspect of the program. Suggestions for modifications to the program are discussed in order to further enhance the usefulness of the program. The process of sport psychology practice in the real world is not widely discussed in the field (Anderson, 2000), and learning activities need to be made available to students so that they can practice providing services to clients (Silva, Conroy, & Zizzi, 1999; Tod, Marchant, & Anderson, 2007). Therefore, the usefulness of this computer program is that it provides quality practice opportunities for graduate students in sport psychology to test out their skills, view the processes of how others approach consulting situations, and engage in reflective practice to become more self-aware and competent practitioners.

AB - Eating disorders, and variants of these disorders (e.g., body dissatisfaction, weight control behaviors), represent pressing and prevalent health problems that affect American adolescents with potentially chronic consequences (Commission on Adolescent Eating Disorders, 2005). Although the World Health Organization (2003) designated these issues as a global priority area for youth mental health, reaching a complete understanding of the developmental processes that increase and maintain risk and protection is complicated by several unique theoretical and empirical challenges. In order to address these conceptually and empirically interrelated problems, the current study integrated existing theoretical frameworks derived from the eating disorder literature with relevant perspectives from the adolescent development field, and elaborated a systems-based theoretical framework and methodology for the study of associations among adolescents' experiences pertinent to eating pathology and body dissatisfaction, their patterns of sports participation, and the implications of these associations for their positive and problematic development. Sports participation was examined as the primary contextual factor because of its central role in affecting adolescent development. Using data from Grades 9 to 11 of the 4-H Study of Positive Youth Development (PYD), this research first identified qualitatively distinct trajectories of adolescents' eating pathology and body dissatisfaction using group-based modeling, and then used multinomial logistic regression analyses to describe the individual and contextual correlates of these pathways. Next, multiple regression analyses were used to examine whether trajectories of eating pathology and body dissatisfaction related to youth positive and problematic development, such as PYD and depression. The final phase of this study investigated whether sports participation moderated associations between specific trajectories of eating pathology and body dissatisfaction and adolescents' positive or problematic development. Results from the group-based modeling and multinomial logistic analyses supported the presence of qualitatively distinct trajectories of eating pathology and body dissatisfaction that differed with respect to patterns of constancy and change across middle adolescence. In addition, several physical, psychological, and demographic factors were associated with adolescents' membership in specific trajectory groups. In general, the results suggested that boys, adolescents with perceptions of normal weight, and adolescents with higher levels of self-worth, were more likely to be in favorable trajectories of eating pathology and body dissatisfaction. Actual weight (BMI-z) at Grade 9 was related to membership in body dissatisfaction trajectories but not to membership in eating pathology trajectories. Maternal education and duration of sports participation were not associated with membership in any of the eating pathology and body dissatisfaction trajectories. Findings from the multiple regression analyses demonstrated that diverse eating pathology and body dissatisfaction trajectories were significantly associated with youth positive and problematic functioning, after accounting for specific demographic, physical, and psychological factors. In general, eating pathology and body dissatisfaction trajectories were associated more with adolescents' depression scores than with adolescents' PYD scores. In addition, results suggested that unique patterns of associations between trajectory group membership and psychosocial functioning existed for female and male adolescents. Among girls, experiencing unhealthy or problematic eating- and weight-related trajectories were not only significantly associated with lower levels of PYD, but were also associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms as well. Among males, membership in problematic eating pathology tra... (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Prior to improving the strength/power qualities associated with a movement, strength and conditioning coaches need to first understand the mechanics of the movement via some sort of movement analysis. The purpose of this study was to determine the key technical features associated with a 180° aerial change of direction (aCOD) performance. The aCOD task involved catching a suspended ball while turning 180° in the air and was recorded using high-speed video. Thirty seven netball players (5 elite, 32 sub-elite) were grouped into three categories (Superior, Average and Below Average) based on the effectiveness of their landing (a complete 180° rotation with a two-foot landing). Seven key technical features were consistently observed in the superior aCOD performances: 1) sinking into a deep hip and knee flexion (∼135°) through the final ground contact in the approach; 2) rotating about the takeoff leg prior to leaving the ground; 3) driving both arms up towards the ball, no more than shoulder width apart; 4) driving the free leg up towards the ball at takeoff; 5) following possession of the ball, rapidly rotating the head Into the new direction; 6) holding the ball close to the body at chest height once possession had been made in preparation for a quick release pass; and, 7) rapid rotation of the lower body throughout the airborne phase to elicit a full 180° turn. This type of analysis provides focus for programming of the appropriate musculature and technical cues for coaching the movement of interest.

AB - It is well known that athletes use mental imagery for five different functions; motivational general-arousal (MG-A; arousal and stress) motivational general-mastery (MG-M; control, mental toughness, and self-confidence), motivational specific (MS; goal-oriented responses), cognitive general (CG; sport-specific strategies), and cognitive specific (CS; sport-specific skills; Hall et al., 1998; Paivio, 1985). While much research has been conducted on the MG-A, MG-M, MS, and CS imagery functions, there has not been as much focus on CG imagery. This is somewhat disheartening since various researchers have pointed out this issue many times (e.g., Hall, 2001). The purpose of this review was to examine the research conducted on CG imagery since the publication of Martin and colleagues’ (1999) applied model of imagery use. A literature search was conducted of published peer-reviewed journal articles using Proquest to identify all studies that have examined CG imagery. Forty-three articles were identified as relevant towards understanding the role of CG imagery in sport. The research findings were discussed in one of two sections depending on the type of study design used (e.g., descriptive/correlational study or imagery intervention). The strengths and weaknesses of the CG imagery studies are discussed. From this review, the authors hope to make researchers aware of the avenues that still need to be explored in regards to CG imagery, as well as provide researchers with potential approaches to answer such questions.

AB - Objectives: Research examining how emotional intelligence (EI) relates to the performance of athletes has been conducted using various EI measures including the Bar-On Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQ-i; Bar-On, 1997), but no one has investigated the factor structure of the EQ-i in the area of sport psychology. The current study explored the dimensional structure and factorial validity of the EQ-i in a sample of male athletes. Design: Confirmatory factor analysis was used to examine Bar-On's (1997, 2004) model of emotional–social intelligence and the 1-5-15 dimensional structure which underpins the EQ-i. Method: A total sample of 706 male athletes from various sports and competing at the national age group level through to the professional level of competition completed the EQ-i. Results: Confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated that the 1-5-15 dimensional structure was a poor fit for the data. A re-specification of the model representing the best fit for the data was a 1-4-15 dimensional structure. The factorial validity of the individual subscales was also examined at the item level using confirmatory factor analysis. Thirteen of the 15 subscales showed close, reasonably good, or mediocre fit for the data. Conclusion: Further construct validation of Bar-On's model and measure is required. Sport psychologists administering the EQ-i in applied practice should consider using the EQ-i subscales rather than referring back to the 1-5-15 dimensional structure.

AB - The use of doping agents by individuals involved in sports is not decreasing. Anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) or 'anabolic steroids' remain the most widely abused drugs. Such drugs can have serious physiological and psychological effects, which should preclude their abuse. The escalation of drug taking in this market has also predisposed opportunities for counterfeiting, with the consequences of adverse effects from non-sterile contamination causing a variety of communicable diseases and other health problems throughout the world of sport. The law is currently vascillatory. In the USA, possession is a federal offence, but it is not in the UK or Europe. However, it is illegal to take drugs in all professional sports with the exception of bodybuilding, where no testing is currently conducted. The majority of dope testing that is conducted is in the field of athletics, in individual sporting events. Team sports have enjoyed a sustained degree of immunity. The consensus of opinion is that the team player would be less likely to wish to bring disrepute on their compatriots, but it is often suggested that team sports (such as football) are more powerful as an industry, than the authorities that test them. Counterfeiting markets have dominated the field of drug use to such an extent that immense temptation pervades for succumbing to the lures of fame and fortune that derive from sporting success. The policy of 'zero tolerance' has failed. Management of this dilemma needs to achieved through education. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)

AB - This chapter addresses the psychology of performance in domains including sports, the performing arts, business/executive coaching, and high-risk professions. Performance psychology and sport psychology are described as interrelated fields. At the same time, with its long history of research as well as practice, sport psychology holds a particular, privileged position within the broader field of performance psychology. The roots of performance psychology lie in the fields of applied sport psychology, psychotherapy, and consultation or coaching. The chapter reviews critical issues in the psychology of performance: standards and excellence, competition, emotion, temporal factors, audience, pressure, performance consequences, and performers' developmental trajectories. Issues of appropriate preparation for performance psychology practice and performance psychologists' roles and ethics are briefly addressed. In the various domains of performance psychology, clients' attitudes toward consultants may vary. Further research, training, and practice implications are reviewed.

AB - When this client inquired about mental training using biofeedback and neurofeedback, he was a 45-year-old male Professional Golf Association (PGA) Level 1 assistant at a country club in South Carolina. I will refer to him as "Al". After retiring from the Marine Corp, Al became a golf course manager and his desire to become a member of the PGA became his goal. He was a self-taught golfer with no formal training. By watching others, asking for tips, reading books, watching training videos and continuous practice, he became a golfer whose average score was in the mid-70s. Al's career as a PGA Professional depended on him passing the Playing Ability Test (PAT). Al knew that he was skilled enough at the mechanics of golf to pass the PAT, but he "continuously lost his focus and self-confidence" when he attempted to pass the PAT. He stated that he experienced a lot of anxiety because of several different factors. Al was taught to balance his autonomic nervous system, to keep his emotional state in neutral or return quickly to a neutral emotional state, to not worry or complain about things he had no control over, and to accept whatever happens with a calm mind state. Al had read every mental golf book that he could find. So, he knew what he was supposed to do, but was unable to "get out of his own way," as Dr Bob Rotella quite often says (Rotella, 2001). Biofeedback and neurofeedback instruments helped him to better understand this concept. After eight years and 22 attempts, he had finally passed the PAT.

An interpretivist approach was adopted to highlight the real life experiences of key stakeholders from the elite level of one particular high-profile, multi-event sport. The 'sociological voices' were crafted into non-fictional narratives and include contributions from an international competitor inexperienced at senior level, three Olympians, a Paralympian, an elite level specialist coach, and a senior administrator—of these, two were female. The data are presented in this way to synthesise the findings into an accessible form, and protect the anonymity of those involved. The main themes to emerge from the interviews and presented in the narratives include: the pressures and responsibilities of being an elite performer, the relation of performance to financial security, the fairness and integrity of sports, the perception of variable robustness of testing amongst different countries, differences between junior level and senior competition and between men and women.

Sports may be seen as an unusual family of social practices that, while aiming at excellence, delimits the legitimate ways in which participants may prepare for, and perform in, those social practices. The present chapter sketches the terrain within the academic bioethics literature concerning the use of AAS for therapy and enhancement. There is examination as to the extent of the prevalence of AAS use within the sporting environment including the standard arguments that are raised within the philosophy of sports ethics giving consideration to the specific policy position of the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA).

AB - Most experts agree that good health depends upon regular exercise and eating the right foods. Daily physical activity helps to maintain overall good health and stable weight. Exercise improves heart and lung function and mental outlook while also preventing or delaying the progression of many chronic illnesses that can shorten life span. But exercise is a dirty word for some people, conjuring up visions of work and effort. Those who say they hate to exercise, however, often admit that they feel better and healthier when they do. The good news is that more people are learning that exercise is a necessary daily activity for good health. This chapter explores the importance of physical activity, discusses individual and team sports, and addresses how people with different physical abilities can still exercise and benefit from a physical activity program. Sports nutrition and injury prevention will also be explored. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)

AB - This chapter presents a validated multifaceted assessment and intervention protocol (Carlstedt Protocol; CP) that has been used on hundreds of athletes over the last 15 years. It is conceptually based on an integrative individual-differences model of peak performance that is supported by strong construct validity and an extensive evolving database of psychophysiological and performance relationships and findings across numerous sports. The CP stresses ecological validity, real-time psychophysiological monitoring, biofeedback-based multimodal intervention and importantly, extensive efficacy testing. The protocol involves a step-by-step hierarchical evidence-based approach that is predicated on the comprehensive assessment of athlete mind-body-motor response tendencies in pre-intervention and intervention phases prior to, during and after practice and official competition (real games/matches). The goal of the protocol is to establish statistical relationships between interventions and objective macro and micro outcome measures of a specific sport, the benchmark for determining whether a mental training method works and to what extent. It was designed to bring accountability to the assessment and intervention process in the fields of sport psychology and biofeedback. Readers will be exposed to specific components of the CP that were applied to starting players on an elite youth baseball team. Group data and findings will be presented along with contrasting case studies that demonstrate wide variability in terms of outcome or intervention efficacy, considerations that are crucial to higher evidentiary athlete assessment and mental training will be featured. It should be noted that this is the first study on record in which athletes' psychophysiological responses were monitored and measured during official league games over the course of an entire season. Pre-intervention assessment and intervention phases (biofeedback) were carried out prior to every at-bat (over 1200 data points/repeated measures; about 100-150 at-bats per player). Complete datasets of psychometric, behavioral, psychophysiological (heart rate variability) and critical moment performance statistics (predictor and macro-micro criterion measures) were generated for analysis and athlete (client) feedback purposes. In addition to discussing group and case study findings, particular attention will be paid to critical issues in applied sport psychology/sport psychophysiology and biofeedback. A goal of this chapter is not only to present data and findings on athletes who have experienced the CP but also advocate for the integration of procedures and methodologies that are vital to evidence-based applied sport psychology, the credibility of the field of sport psychology/biofeedback and its practitioners. Consequently, points of critique and rationale for doing specific things within the protocol will be discussed throughout the chapter. As I progress through specific procedures of the CP player data will be inserted along with comments regarding their relevance. Certain procedures, methods and response outtakes (e.g. heart rate variability reports) will also be shown and discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)

AB - In exercise psychology, cognition is again very broadly defined, and empirical studies have focused on a variety of cognitive abilities in furthering our understanding of how physical activity might affect cognitive performance. As in the parent discipline of psychology, exercise psychology uses behavioral measures and measures of cerebral structure and activation to ascertain the effects of physical activity on cognitive outcomes. Behavioral measures are typified by tasks that require the participant to perform a cognitive activity with performance operationalized in various ways, including number of correct responses, number of errors, failure to respond, and speed of response. There are literally hundreds of behavioral measures of cognition, and each is expected to assess at least one underlying cognitive ability. Measures of cerebral structure usually involve magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and provide measures of the volume and density of cerebral structures at both the cortical and subcortical levels. Based on the link between cerebral structure and cognitive performance, findings from these studies are used to make inferences regarding the effects of physical activity on cognitive abilities. Measures of cerebral activation typically are taken concurrently with the performance of a cognitive task, and these measures are used to identify the influence of physical activity on patterns and amounts of activation during task performance. The measures of cerebral activation that have been used in the extant literature include electroencephalographic (EEG) activity, event-related potentials (ERPs), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), functional MRI (fMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).

AB - The new emphasis in psychology is on positive psychology—on how healthy, normal, and exceptional individuals can get the most from life (e.g.. Marsh & Craven, 2006; Seligman & Csikszentmihalyi, 2000; Vallerand et al, 2003). Consistent with this emphasis, a positive self-concept is valued as a desirable outcome in sport, exercise, and health psychology as well as in many other disciplines (e.g., developmental, mental health, social, personality, and educational psychology). The study of self-concept has a long (and often controversial) history, and it is one of the most established areas of research in the social sciences. This chapter provides an overview of the conceptual and measurement aspects of self-concept, focusing in particular on physical self-concept (PSC). We begin with the theoretical and historical underpinnings of the self-concept construct. We then discuss how these differences in conceptual frameworks have led to differences in the development of PSC instruments. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)

AB - The complex relationship between body image and aesthetic physical activities, defined here as activities that emphasize artistic qualities or beauty, is seen in contrasting images of "having the time of my life" ( Dirty Dancing ) and "oh, what a feeling" ( Flashdance ) with the very public struggles with eating disorders for prima ballerina Gelsey Kirkland and Olympic gymnast Nadia Comaneci and the fictional lead character in the recent award-winning film Black Swan. The possibility for dance and other aesthetic pursuits to provide both powerfully positive and negative experiences for its participants is an interesting phenomenon. On the one hand, evidence exists that engaging in physical activity can improve one's body image. In fact, dance has been successfully used therapeutically with at-risk populations such as people with obesity, mental illness, and developmental delay. On the other hand, gymnasts and dancers, in particular ballet dancers, are renowned for their extremely thin bodies and high rates of eating disorders. The question arises as to where the line between positive pursuits of these forms of physical activity and the negative consequences of this pursuit occurs and why. This article reports an examination of trends in body image in different aesthetic physical activities and correlated or feasible causal factors.

AB - Doping remains a practice among a small proportion of the sporting community, yet individuals taking prohibited substances appear to have limited understanding of their effects. The purpose of this review is to document the knowledge of performance enhancing and prohibited substances in elite and recreational athletes. A systematic search of the literature produced 25 papers satisfying the eligibility criteria: 11 investigating elite athletes' knowledge; 2 examining recreational athletes in the fitness community, 7 exploring younger athletes' and adolescents' knowledge; and 5 probing athlete knowledge of over-the-counter preparations that contain prohibited substances. Few studies comprehensively investigated athlete knowledge of performance enhancing substances and fewer used psychometrically tested questionnaires. Most studies directed questions towards assessing knowledge of the desirable and adverse effects of anabolic steroids and stimulants, and to identifying known prohibited substances. More recent studies evaluated athletes' knowledge of wider anti-doping issues and a range of prohibited substances. Overall, elite athlete knowledge was poor to moderate. With the exception of one study in which recreational and young athletes and adolescents were tested on their knowledge of anabolic steroids which was observed to be poor, particularly in identifying adverse effects of the drug. Similarly, athletes' awareness of over-the-counter preparations that contain prohibited substances was limited. Doping practice in the sporting community presents a social, ethical and medical concern to sporting, government and health authorities. Despite educational interventions and sanctions, this problem has not abated. Athletes' knowledge and awareness of prohibited substances is poor to moderate. Therefore, it is essential that individuals who dope or are considering the practice have an adequate knowledge of its effects on health, performance and career. Developing and implementing comprehensive education programs is a fundamental component in the prevention of doping behaviour. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)

AB - This chapter discusses the measurement of precompetitive and competitive emotional experiences and how these experiences affect sport performance through specific cognitive, physiological and behavioral mechanisms. We begin by defining the often misunderstood concepts of affect, mood, and emotion. Two specific emotions, fear and anxiety, are then elucidated, followed by a discussion of arousal and stress and their roles in considerations of emotional experience. We then summarize the state of contemporary theory in the study of emotion. A discussion of specific measures and assessment tools used in the study of emotion follows, with an emphasis on anxiety. Throughout this discussion, we highlight empirical works from the extant mainstream sport psychology literature as examples of how the measures of interest can be implemented. Finally, we provide recommendations for both researchers and practitioners. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)

AB - The ability of athletes in both individual and team sports to self-regulate their behaviors, feelings, and thoughts before and during their sport activity is crucial in determining proficiency. In this chapter we examine a number of measurement issues associated with instruments and questionnaires given to athletes to assess their coping skills. We also look at preperformance strategies that athletes can use to prepare themselves for coping with the physical, cognitive, and emotional demands of their sport activity. The purpose of this chapter is threefold. First is to discuss a number of measurement issues related to instruments and questionnaires dealing with the coping process in sport and exercise settings from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives. Second is to highlight a number of measurement issues associated with the use of preperformance coping strategies. While there are many different coping strategies available to athletes, in this chapter we focus on only one type of coping strategy—preperformance—that can be used in one type of sport activity—self-paced events. Third is to offer researchers a number of recommendations on how to strengthen the validation process of instruments and questionnaires used to assess coping in sport and how to increase the number of variables measured in studies on preperformance coping strategies as well as to provide practitioners with a number of recommendations for selecting coping instruments, questionnaires, and preperformance coping strategies.

AB - Curiosity about and interest in optimal performance has grown markedly among researchers, practitioners, athletes, and performers over the past 30 years. Despite this interest, elite-level performance in "the zone" continues to be an elusive phenomenon for researchers and practitioners to understand. This chapter discusses the various psychological factors involved in optimal performance and summarizes the historical and current research and scholarly writings in the area. The subjective experience of optimal performance is defined and clarified, and the psychological profile of optimal performance is described and elaborated. Issues related to the assessment of psychological characteristics and skills associated with optimal performance are discussed, and a model for understanding the myriad of factors that impact optimal performance is provided. The application and effectiveness of psychological skills training to promote the occurrence of optimal performance is reviewed as well. Finally, directions and opportunities for future research are presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)

AB - Although sport psychology is an interdisciplinary field, it has a natural and strong philosophical and historical connection to counseling psychology. With this connection as the foundation, we discuss sport psychology's history and identify the current issues in the field, such as graduate training and professional certification. We define mental toughness and identify the skills and strategies consultants use to assist athletes, teams, and coaches in attaining it and improving their performances. Several clinical issues are then discussed in the context of the uniqueness of the sport environment. Given the centrality of training to the field, we present an ideal training model for students and professionals who want to be applied sport psychologists. Finally, we identify the issues that we believe will define the future of applied sport psychology and offer suggestions on how to address them.

AB - The controversy over whether fantasy sports should be considered a new form of gambling was investigated. The predominance rule was used to operationally define gambling. This rule states that an activity is gambling if outcomes are due more to chance than to skill. Individuals active in a fantasy baseball league (commonly referred to as “owners”) and individuals who had never entered any type of fantasy league (“non-owners”) participated. Perceptions of skill-to-chance ratios were assessed and a content analysis of the specific skill and chance features involved in fantasy baseball was conducted. The results showed that fantasy baseball owners and non-owners judged outcomes to be more the result of skill. In an attempt to determine whether these results were supported by actual outcomes, a second study analyzed the records of a fantasy baseball league over an extended period. The findings of this additional study also suggest that skill may predominant over chance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - Psychological skills training procedures for athletic performance enhancement, a cognitive-behaviorally based group of procedures, have traditionally been understood from the perspective of self-control theory. From the perspective of this classic theoretical model, increasing and developing mental skills promotes an athlete's ability to control internal processes such as cognitions, images, and emotions, which in turn is thought to enhance performance via the creation of an ideal internal performance state. The evidence for the efficacy of these procedures has been previously challenged, as has the empirical evidence in support of the mechanisms by which these procedures are purported to work. Based upon the burgeoning empirical data in the broad area of emotion regulation, this article (a) presents similarities and differences between traditional PST and contemporary acceptance-based approaches to performance enhancement with an eye toward rapprochement, (b) offers an alternative explanation for the possible mechanism by which psychological skills training might be effective, and (c) suggests some possible modifications of mental skills training procedures that might enhance their efficacy.

AB - The purpose of this study was to examine how female freestyle wrestlers experience the resonance process and how a resonance intervention affected performance and achievement of ideal feelings. The four-part Resonance Performance Model (RPM) describes the process through which experts become accomplished by defining and achieving ideal feelings. Although the RPM has been successfully applied in several sport contexts, further exploration is needed in different sports to continue the model's validation. Three female wrestlers from a university wrestling team participated in semi-structured interviews, which were analyzed via Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis, and reflective journaling. Participants gained insight in five areas: achievement of the Dream feeling, perceived effect on performance, decision-making, Obstacle-Preparation Loop and the most meaningful RPM component. Results support the RPM as a tool for improving self-awareness and achievement of desired feelings. It may also be used to improve performance of freestyle wrestlers and other athletes.

AB - This paper summarizes the topic of well-being as it applies to competitive athletes, with a particular focus on definitional and conceptual issues. Established definitions within research on human happiness and flourishing based on the hedonic and eudaimonic perspectives are contrasted against definitions applied within sport psychology. The majority of the reviewed sport psychology studies either failed to define well-being or used a variety of labels to describe the construct (e.g., subjective well-being, psychological well-being, mental well-being). A large number of assessments have been used to assess well-being among athletes, but most were applied with only a weak theoretical rationale and did not distinguish between well-being at the global and sport levels. It is concluded that well-being studies within sport psychology have been hampered by conceptual ambiguity, which makes it difficult to compare results across studies and generalize findings in order to develop a sound theoretical base of knowledge. Future research needs to more explicitly define the conceptual framework of well-being and the level (global or context-specific) on which the construct is investigated. Toward this goal, an integrated model is presented to provide a conceptual well-being structure in sport studies, and future directions for research are discussed.

AB - The development of talent is a complex process mediated by a host of psychological, social, physical, and environmental variables. Unfortunately, the multiple processes involved in talent development are frequently ignored by the systems and protocols employed in sport. Modern approaches to talent development are beginning to stress the initial possession, then subsequent development, of generic psychological characteristics (e.g. psychological characteristics of developing excellence; MacNamara, Button, & Collins, 2010a, 2010b) as the best way to realize latent potential. Accordingly, this paper describes the development and initial validation of the Psychological Characteristics of Developing Excellence Questionnaire (PCDEQ). In the first phase, an initial list of 160 items was developed. A combination of expert panel reviews, cognitive interviews, and a pilot test was used to assess the relevance, representativeness, and validity of each item. Ninety-six items were retained following these steps. Exploratory factor analysis, with a sample of 363 athletes, revealed an interpretable 59-item, 6-factor solution with good internal consistency (0.870, 0.866, 0.847, 0.741, 0.749, and 0.701 respectively). The Psychological Characteristics of Developing Excellence Questionnaire would appear to hold promise as a useful tool to provide coaches and athletes with information about the psychological characteristics of developing excellence that are being properly addressed or neglected during different stages of development or in different contexts.

AB - Physical education (PE) in primary schools has traditionally been taught by qualified primary teachers. More recently, some teaching of PE in primary schools has been undertaken by coaches (mostly football coaches). These coaches hold national governing body awards but do not hold teaching qualifications. Thus, coaches may not be adequately prepared to teach PE in curriculum time. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the perceptions of a group of community-based football coaches working in primary schools for the impact of a Continuing Professional Development (CPD) programme on their ability to undertake ‘specified work’ to cover PE in primary schools. The programme focused on four areas identified as important to enable coaches to cover specified work: short- and medium-term planning, pedagogy, knowledge of the curriculum and reflection. Results showed that for the majority of coaches the CPD programme had made them more aware of the importance of these four areas and had helped to develop their knowledge and ability to put this into practice in covering planning, preparation and assessment time. However, further input is still required to develop coaches’ knowledge and understanding in all four areas, but especially their curriculum knowledge, as well as their ability to put these into practice consistently. These findings are discussed in relation to the implications of employing coaches to cover the teaching of PE in primary schools and, if employed, what CPD coaches need to develop the necessary knowledge, skill and understanding for covering specified work in schools.

Can psychologists help performers in sport, business, and the performing arts achieve peak performances more often and with greater consistency? Sport psychologists have taken the lead in researching peak performance in an attempt to answer this question. This article focuses on optimal experiences in sport and ways in which the author works with athletes to help them achieve peak performances. Peak performance in sport is overviewed, the application of two models related to the preparation for peak performance in sport are discussed, and applied sport psychology experiential knowledge is shared.

In light of such an extrinsically motivated structure, the purpose of the current study was to examine the impact of the talent development environment on the goal pursuits and life aspirations of young athletes. Intrinsic goal striving was predicted by a mastery approach and an environment that prioritized long-term development and fundamentals, and provided a good support network. On the contrary, a lack of quality preparation and understanding of athletes promoted extrinsic goal-striving, as did both performance-approach and performance-avoidance goals.

This book is a welcome addition to the field of adapted physical education and youth sports. Although there are many books on youth sports and many others on adapted physical education, this is one of the few books in which the author attempts to combine these two areas to provide concrete information on how to include children with disabilities into youth sport. This is an excellent resource for parents and coaches who want to include children with various types of disabilities into youth sports programs. The information is practical, nicely organized, and will help both parents and coaches create more successful and meaningful youth sports experiences for children with disabilities.

AB - Presents an obituary of Ema Geron (1920–2011). Ema Geron was born in Bulgaria on 13 October 1920 and passed away in Jerusalem, Israel on 11 March 2011 at the age of 90. Ema was a pioneer in the sport psychology domain. In 1965 Ema attended the first congress of the International Society of Sport Psychology (ISSP). For her major contribution to the field of Sport and Exercise Psychology, the ISSP has awarded her the ISSP Distinguished Scholar Award in 1993. Ema’s scientific work centered on psychological preparation of athletes for competitions, concentration and volition, and psychological characteristics of athletes as a function of sport-type, all of which were considered milestones for the newly established domain of sport psychology. Her research on gymnastics with a special focus on female athletes may be considered as the dawn of the gender perspective in sport psychology. She will be remembered as a great woman who left a great legacy behind her. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Objective: The aim of this study was to demonstrate how research on emotion in sport psychology might inform the field of human factors. Background: Human factors historically has paid little attention to the role of emotion within the research on human-system relations. The theories, methods, and practices related to research on emotion within sport psychology might be informative for human factors because fundamentally, sport psychology and human factors are applied fields concerned with enhancing performance in complex, real-world domains. Method: Reviews of three areas of theory and research on emotion in sport psychology are presented, and the relevancy of each area for human factors is proposed: (a) emotional preparation and regulation for performance, (b) an emotional trait explanation for risk taking in sport, and (c) the link between emotion and motor behavior. Finally, there are suggestions for how to continue cross-talk between human factors and sport psychology about research on emotion and related topics in the future. Results: The relevance of theory and research on emotion in sport psychology for human factors is demonstrated. Conclusion: The human factors field and, in particular, research on human-system relations may benefit from a consideration of theory and research on emotion in sport psychology. Application: Theories, methods, and practices from sport psychology might be applied usefully to human factors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - Reviews the book, Performance psychology in action: A casebook for working with athletes, performing artists, business leaders, and professionals in high-risk occupations edited by Kate F. Hays (see record 2009-05799-000). Over the years, the field of sport psychology has gradually been expanding to include other domains in which psychological skills training (PST) enhances performance - most notably in performing arts, business, and the military. The book is organized into an arc of subject areas, beginning with Mental Attributes for Peak Performance and continuing through Performance Challenges, Performance-Related Consequences, and The Consultant and The System. It concludes with a wonderful reflection on the role of The Consultant as a Performer by Brown, who uses himself as a case example from a time when he prepared and delivered a presentation for medical faculty and residents at a teaching hospital. The practitioners conclude each chapter with a case study consisting of the scripts from personal interactions with clients, as well as a reflection about their methodologies and thoughts about the process. As the experts describe their interactions with clients, the reader is exposed to a variety of styles and viewpoints. I believe the book is an important contribution to the literature. It would be an excellent seminar textbook for graduate students and case study guide for both practicum interns and veterans in private practice.

AB - This is a study on tactical transference between collective sports with similar internal logic. Fifty eight secondary school students (34 girls and 24 boys, M = 14.4; SD = 0.6) in physical education classes had four class sessions to practice and learn how to solve different 2 vs. 1 problem situations in a well-known sport (basketball). Afterwards, they were evaluated on two tactical aspects (mental solution and physical skill solution) through declarative and procedural tests. They were then asked to apply the same concepts learned in basketball to an unfamiliar sport (floorball). The results show that the tactical knowledge acquired in basketball can be transferred to a sport with a similar internal logic such as floorball. However, transference of declarative knowledge is higher than that of procedural knowledge. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - Personal life meaning is necessary to successful aging, and meaning has been found to derive from many potential sources. This qualitative study asked if active participation in sports can be a source of meaning for older adults, and how that meaning is experienced. It further asked how older adults would describe meaning from sports participation as contributing to successful aging. The research was performed qualitatively using a generic approach. The sample was purposive and the data collected through personal interviews. The research found that sports participation is a significant source of meaning for those older adults who engage in it, and that the meaning is experienced in a number of ways. Themes abstracted from participant-provided data that speak affirmatively to these research questions were positive physical and emotional experiences; health and fitness, physical and mental; personal challenge; social aspects of participation in sports; lessons learned in sports transfer to other areas of life; compensation for inevitable aging deficits; and must be active for as long as possible. Further, the research findings are discussed in relation to prominent models of successful aging and other research pertinent to it. Additional research is recommended in the area of successful aging, particularly study into the sources of meaning experienced by physically challenged individuals who nevertheless exhibit all the other aspects of aging well.

AB - Contemporary sport is associated with increasing pressure relative to the outcome. The player is required to achieve the master level as quick as possible, in the widest area of operation. This could be a major threat to the internal LOC. Sport psychology is a discipline, relatively young but dynamically growing, that follows the changes on the ground of the sport. Sport psychologists, who offer suitable mental training, support player's development in holistic way. It is inextricably linked with internal LOC. Psychology allows to treat a LOC as a dimension of personality. In the literature there are indications that the LOC may have the dimensions relating to the situation of success or failure, as well as to different areas of functioning. These reports, as well as a deficit of specialized research methods used in the sport, inspire to create a questionnaire PKSPwS. This paper represents a description of the subsequent stages of the work on this tool. The questionnaire allows to diagnose the sense of control in a situation of success and failure, but also enables identification LOC in specific social situations, typical for the players—in a situation of competition, training, interpersonal relationships. The issue of LOC in the context of the sports situation is complex. This points further research perspectives not only on the ground of the psychology of sport, but also include health psychology, developmental psychology and cultural psychology.

AB - Tailoring intervention to particular target groups presents a challenge for the promotion of physical activity. While target group-specific offers in leisure and health sports mainly focus on objective needs (diseases, risk factors), individual reasons for exercise are scarcely taken into account. This can be considered one of the causes of the drop out phenomenon in leisure and health sports. This paper presents a differential-psychological approach to the segmentation of the target group (middle-aged people), focusing mainly on individual explicit motives and goals. The study group consisted of 139 women and 89 men ( M = 48 years, SD = 8 years) who took part in a screening of their physical-motor, health, and mental characteristics as well as characteristics of their sports and exercise behavior. The data is used for a cluster-analytical classification of typical motive profiles. On the basis of these profiles, nine “motive-based types of sports person” are characterized with regard to physical-motor, health as well as activity-related prerequisites. These types of sports person can form the basis for a target group-specific conception of sports programs that should, in the sense of a person-oriented approach, be tailored to a wide range of individual prerequisites.

AB - Drug use and abuse is perhaps the biggest challenge facing sport today. However, in the eye of the storm of public and press opinion and with medals and morals at stake it can be difficult to gain a clear perspective on this complex issue. Drugs in Sport is the most comprehensive and accurate text available on the subject. Now in a fully revised and updated fifth edition, taking into account the latest regulations, methods and landmark cases, the book explores the hard science behind drug use in sport, as well as the ethical, social, political and administrative context. Key topics include: Mode of action and side effects of each major class of drugs used in sport; Discussion of cutting-edge issues, including gene doping; The latest doping control regulations of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) methods and advances in doping control, including new intelligence-led detection policies; The use of Therapeutic Use Exemption for certain drugs banned in sport; Issues surrounding non-prohibited substances and ergogenic aids; An assessment of the prevalence of drug taking in sport. Accessibly written, extensively referenced, and supported throughout with illustrative case studies and data, Drugs in Sport provides a comprehensive, objective resource for students and researchers, athletes, sports scientists, coaches, journalists, sports administrators and policymakers.

AB - On behalf of Athletic Insight, the journal that made this book possible, welcome to the "Sport Psychology: Training, Competition and Coping". Following the release of "Contemporary Sport Psychology" (2010), where revised versions of earlier featured materials from Athletic Insight were printed, the present book is built from the most recent contributions to Athletic Insight, accepted in 2009. Within the present compilation you will find an international listing of contributors. Authors have contributed to this compilation from the United States, Canada, Switzerland, Finland, Sweden, Israel, Japan and Australia. The structure for this book is comprised of four sections. Section one includes three invited papers that are not found in the 2009 installment of Athletic Insight. The first paper is guest authored by Dr. Frank Gardner (Kean University) and Dr. Zella Moore from Manhattan College. Frank is among the premiere applied sport psychologists in professional ice-hockey, having worked with NHL Stanley Cup winning teams. Zella is an elite sport psychologist as well with elite amateur and professional athletes and teams. Frank and Zella have been asked to speak about clinical practice within their submission, and they do so with a paper titled "Challenges and Opportunities in the Assimilation and Delivery of Acceptance-based Behavioral Interventions". Dr. Kerry McGannon presently works at Laurentian University as an exercise and health psychology researcher. Kerry is also in my view, among the research elite among those who employ qualitative methods in sport and exercise. Within her submission, Kerry combines auto-ethnography and creative non-fiction to produce a self-reflexive story about exercise self-identity and embodied running. Jack Watson and his colleagues have written about the ethical concerns that surround internet page use in sport and exercise psychology. Jack is among the most proflic researchers in topic matter pertaining to the intersection of ethics and our field. Thereafter, we follow with sections that reflect the consecutive released Athletic installments from 2009. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)(preface)

AB - The aim of this book was to investigate the relationship between intellectual functioning and sports performance for athletes with intellectual disabilities and to present the Computerized Cognitive test battery for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (CCIID), which was developed for that purpose. A literature review indicated that there is a significant difference between physical performance of athletes with and without intellectual disabilities, but so far, no studies have examined the association between the degree of intellectual functioning and sports performance for athletes with intellectual disabilities. Following an analysis of verbal and nonverbal intelligence tests, it was decided to develop a new Computerized Cognitive test battery for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (CCIID), which was focused on the target population (individuals with intellectual disabilities) and based on theories of intelligence and research of cultural fairness. The test battery includes two subtests for inductive reasoning and one subtest for visual processing. Further research should investigate this relationship for different sports disciplines and examine the role of adaptive behaviour and different cognitive abilities using a wider range of cognitive information processing tests.

AB - The purpose of this qualitative case and action research study was to describe and evaluate the implementation of a one-season-long goal setting program in an ice hockey team in Finland. The aim of the study was to explore the process of setting specific and quantitatively measurable goals in team sports. The data were derived from field observations and interviews. It was found that setting specific and quantitatively measurable goals in a team, proposed by the goal setting theory, was difficult in practice. Setting specific and measurable goals, and goals concerning the core areas of team and individual performance would have led to multiple goals and consequently to an uncontrollable situation. It is therefore suggested that setting general and unspecific goals, which enable the development of technical, tactical and phycical ice-hockey skills would be beneficial.

AB - Successful athletes differ psychologically from their less successful counterparts in their mastery and proper application of an array of mental skills that allow them to anticipate success, concentrate on the task at hand, transfer skills and strategies from practice into competition, and overcome adversity, which is inherent in competitive sport. Sport psychology deals with the psychological factors that influence physical performance—including sport, exercise, work, rehabilitation, and the arts (e.g., dance, acting, performing music). In more recent years, sport psychology has become increasingly linked to areas that go beyond sport performance. The most notable areas of expanded study and practice include psychophysiology (i.e., examining physiological responses that influence or accompany cognition, such as thinking and emotion), exercise psychology, and rehabilitation psychology (also called psychology of athletic injuries). Sport and exercise psychology organizations, dimensions of sport psychology: applying sport psychology to daily life, clarification of correct titles, ethics in sport psychology, and proper inventory use are discussed.

AB - Alcohol is the most widely used drug among athletes and its misuse with this population is well documented (O'Brien & Lyons, 2000). However, underlying emotional causes for its misuse have not been identified, nor has the interaction of gender and athletic status been examined. We hypothesized that coping styles used by athletes would relate to their drinking behaviors and this pattern would differ based on gender and athletic status. Female non-athletes consumed the least amount of alcohol and male non-athletes were the least likely to become intoxicated, whereas male athletes drank the greatest amount and were the most likely to become intoxicated. Drinking to cope had the highest correlation to drinking behaviors, but there were differences in the relation between coping tactics and drinking behaviors dependent upon gender and athletic status.

AB - This chapter discusses anabolic steroids as performance enhancing drugs in sports. For centuries, it was popularly believed that symptoms of ageing in men were caused by testicular failure. This stimulated a search for an active principle of the testicles that, when isolated, would restore sexual and mental vigour to ageing men. The testicular principle, we now know, is the male sex hormone testosterone, which was first synthesised in 1935. Experimental studies in both animals and humans soon showed that testosterone possessed both anabolic and androgenic actions. The androgenic actions of testosterone are those actions involving the development and maintenance of primary and secondary sexual characteristics while the anabolic actions consist of the positive effects of testosterone in inhibiting urinary nitrogen loss and stimulating protein synthesis, particularly in skeletal muscle. Synthetic anabolic steroids that mimic the effects of testosterone have been manufactured. However, a number of substances possess anabolic activity but are not based on the "steroidal" structure of testosterone. For this reason, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) prohibited list describes the class as anabolic agents, which includes both anabolic steroids and other anabolic agents. This group of other anabolic agents will be described later in this chapter. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)

AB - The purpose of this study was to test the predictions of cognitive evaluation theory (CET) by exploring the relationship between Division 1 student-athletes' ( N = 122) perceptions of scholarships and intrinsic motivation (IM). Student-athletes were asked to rate the extent to which they perceived their own scholarship and athletic scholarships in general as informational (i.e., competence feedback) and controlling. IM was measured with the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory. Results showed: a) athletes' perceptions of scholarships as competence feedback predicted the perceived competence aspect of IM, b) athletes' perceptions of scholarships as controlling did not predict IM, and c) there were no differences on IM based on percentage of teammates on scholarship. Implications of the study included a better understanding of student-athletes' perceptions of scholarships, support for aspects of CET, and considerations in the measurement of IM.

AB - A review of the burnout literature reveals a paucity of research examining the relationship between goal orientation, motivational climate, and burnout among collegiate student-athletes. The present research investigated the relationship of these constructs among Division I student-athletes from a mid-Atlantic university. Gender differences in burnout were also examined. Student-athletes ( N = 14) completed inventories assessing burnout, motivational climate, and goal orientation. Significant relationships between burnout and motivational climate were observed. Athletes perceiving high ego-lowtask climates reported the greatest burnout levels. Female athletes also reported significantly greater burnout levels. Motivational climate and gender also predicted burnout among participants. Results provide support for examining burnout within an Achievement Goal Theory framework. The importance of the potential social impact of coaches and gender on collegiate athlete burnout is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)

AB - The incidence of athlete burnout among competitive athletes from youth, high school, and collegiate age groups as well as the associations between competitive trait anxiety and personal control with athlete burnout were explored. The sample consisted of 153 competitive athletes (58 men, 95 women) from three age groups. The Hades Athlete Burnout Inventory (Eades, 1990), Sport Anxiety Scale (Smith, Smoll, & Schutz, 1990), and a modified version of the Control Over One's Sport Environment scale (Tetrick & Larocco, 1987) were completed by 30 youth (ages 10-13 years), 67 high school (ages 14-18 years), and 56 college (ages 18-22 years) athletes. Also, a directional scale was added to the Sport Anxiety Scale on which athletes rated the extent to which items were perceived as helpful or hurtful to performance. Results revealed that overall the sample reported a low incidence of burnout ( M = 62.88, SD = 33.67). A moderate to strong positive relationship ( r = .645) between athlete burnout and competitive trait anxiety was found as well as a moderate negative correlation ( r = -.433) between athlete burnout and perceived control. Youth athletes ( M = 28.21, SD = 18.41) scored significantly ( p < .05) lower on the EABI than high school ( M = 69.66, SD = 21.93) and college ( M = 72.95, SD = 39.24) athletes, and women ( M = 68.89, SD = 37.49) reported significantly ( p < .05) higher burnout scores than men ( M = 52.19, SD = 22.19). Somatic anxiety was perceived to be helpful to performance ( M = 2.50, SD = 12.95) while worry ( M = -1.75, SD = 11.34) and concentration disruption ( M = -1.01, SD = 8.54) were perceived as detrimental to performance.

AB - Approximately20% to 70% of athletes may experience some type of performance staleness during their training seasons or careers (Morgan, O'Connor, Sparling, & Pate, 1987; Nederhof, Lemmink, Visscher, Meeusen, & Mulder, 2006). While monitoring an athlete's training load, or "stress" can help prevent staleness (Kellmann & Kallus, 2001), it can also be costly, invasive, one-dimensional and time consuming. The purpose of this investigation was to construct and examine an abbreviated self-report measure of underrecovery, the "Brief Assessment of Recovery Stress" (BARS) that would be convenient and useful for applied sport psychologists. BARS is a 19-item, Likert type self-report instrument designed to efficiently assess stress recovery status perceptions more quickly than the Recovery-Stress Questionaire-76 Sport (RESTQ-76; Kellmann & Kallus). Participants were 387 undergraduate college student-athletes and non-athletes from a large southern and mid-Atlantic university. Results suggest that BARS, in its early form, is a reliable,practical instrument. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)

AB - Incentives play an important role in human motivation (see Beckmann & Heckhausen, 2008). In the present research we used Rheinberg's (2008) distinction of activity-related incentives (e.g., having fun) and purpose-related incentives (e.g., improved fitness) and investigated the influence of these two types of incentives on commitment and well-being in the domain of sport. Assuming that activity-related incentives have stronger rewarding effects on human behaviour than purpose-related incentives, we hypothesized activity-related incentives to be stronger predictors of sport-commitment and well-being than purpose-related incentives. Study 1 ( N = 129) confirmed this hypothesis using a correlational design. In Study 2 ( N = 67) we experimentally induced activity- and purpose-related incentives. We found stronger effects of activity-related incentives on sport-commitment and well-being compared to purpose-related incentives.

AB - The phenomenon of collective collapse in team sports, conceived in terms of negative psychological momentum when the players on a team suddenly perform below the expected level despite having had a good start, was investigated in two studies. One of them involved four male coaches of different sports, all at the elite level, and the other involved nine male players from a handball team, likewise at the elite level. Semistructured interviews were employed in both cases. The major causes of collective collapse were found to be inappropriate behavior, failure of the role system to function properly, negative communication within the team, a change in the tactics of the opposing team, and goals being scored by that team. Factors seen as needing to be dealt with to prevent collective collapse included negative thinking, negative emotions, and negative emotional contagion. The studies provide a team perspective on negative psychological momentum as well as tentative proposals for avoiding collective collapse.

AB - This chapter discusses gene doping in athletic competition. There is concern that methods developed for genetic approaches to human disease (gene therapy) may be used for athletic enhancement. Although there have been 1537 human gene therapy trials approved in the past 20 years, very few have shown clear efficacy and no therapeutic products have been registered for human use apart from two viral products for the treatment of cancer that are licensed in China. Genetic manipulation as a form of performance enhancement is, at the time of writing this, still a theoretical rather than a proven issue. The possibility of advances in genetic technology being applied in sports has been recognized by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) since 2001. The current 2010 regulations define gene doping as follows: The following, with the potential to enhance athletic performance, are prohibited: 1) the transfer of cells or genetic elements (e.g. DNA, RNA); 2) the use of pharmacological or biological agents that alter gene expression; 3) Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor delta (PPARδ) agonists (e.g. GW 1516) and PPARδ-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) axis agonists (e.g. AICAR) are prohibited. Why is gene doping seen as such a problem for WADA? Conventional drug and protein treatments are given on an intermittent basis via oral or intravenous dosing. It is necessary to give large doses to maintain effective levels in target tissue(s) until the time of the next dose. This peak-and-trough pharmacodynamics means that there is a greater chance of detection of high levels of the prohibited drug. In contrast, gene transfer means that continuous steady-state expression is possible and so the peak level may only be close to the minimum therapeutic level, making detection harder. Secondly, as the protein is made within the body of the treated individual it is more likely to be indistinguishable from the normal endogenous protein. Finally, in many cases the gene and its product may remain within the treated tissue, for example skeletal muscle, and so is less likely to be detected by assays using urine or blood. Consequently, gene doping may be harder to detect than conventional drug doping and so may be more likely to be adopted by athletes who are seeking to gain an unfair competitive advantage.

AB - This chapter discusses, cultural sport psychology aims at a culturally sensitive research and practice of sport psychology. Central to the debates of what constitutes a culturally sensitive approach is an understanding of culture itself To attempt to answer the deceptively simple question "What is culture?" opens a Pandora box of interpretation and takes one on a journey of discovery. He has been on this jounce since he was first introduced to cultural studies in 2000. His research foci have been shifting over time from exploration of how sociocultural difference is an effect of power relations to genealogical analysis of the production of knowledge in sport psychology. My current concern is that "culture"increasingly becomes a commodity in our globalizes scholarship—something that is packaged, marketed, and consumed by at times unreflective application of research based knowledge.

AB - Youth participation in competitive sports continues to grow by leaps and bounds as children hit the fields in recreational and school-based sports at earlier ages than previous generations. It is suggested that as many as 1.25 million high school student athletes compete in contact sports (Iverson, Gaetz, Lovell, & Collins, 2004). In the current Zeitgeist of hockey moms and soccer dads proudly sporting these titles on their T-shirts, young brains are increasingly exposed to head injuries, of which mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), also referred to as concussion, is the most common. Youth may not report or be aware of the immediate signs of concussion, such as disorientation, confusion, visual disturbance, balance difficulties, slowness in responding, amnesia for the event, nausea, vomiting, and headache. In fact, in a study that surveyed knowledge about concussion in minor league hockey players (Cusimano, 2009), it was estimated that approximately 25% to 50% of youth were only able to identify one symptom or no symptoms of concussion. Furthermore, parents and teachers may not realize the impact of the lingering effects of concussion, such as slowed mental processing, poor attention and concentration, memory difficulties, mental fogginess, difficulty multi-tasking, significant fatigue, irritability, and sadness. It is not uncommon for a symptomatic youth to return promptly to school, only to experience a sudden decline in grades, decreased motivation, and an increase in behavioral difficulties. Often enough, these changes go untreated or are misattributed to adolescent angst or an undiagnosed learning disorder (LD) or attention disorder (ADHD). This lack of proper identification and treatment can unwittingly wound a child's sense of self, alter his or her academic career, and unnecessarily cut short his or her athletic endeavors. The purpose of the current chapter is to present an overview of sport-related concussion in youth that will address epidemiology, common misconceptions, possible gender differences, cumulative effects, and concussion assessment, treatment, and management. However, its greater mission is to advocate, through education, on behalf of these youth athletes for whom we, the adults, are ultimately responsible.

AB - Inflammation is the major response of the body to sports injuries. Moderation of the inflammatory response may be beneficial, certainly in terms of improving the comfort of the injured subject but also in accelerating the restoration of a competitor to fitness. In this chapter an alternative therapeutic approach using steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs will be considered. Whilst the use and approach to treatment of these drugs differ from the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) the underlying issues are essentially the same. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) 2010 prohibited list states that all glucocorticosteroids are prohibited when administered by oral, rectal, intravenous or intramuscular routes. In accordance with the International Standard for Therapeutic Use Exemptions (TUEs), a declaration of use must be completed by the athlete for glucocorticosteroids administered by intra-articular, periarticular, peritendinous, epidural, intradermal or inhalation routes. Topical preparations when used for auricular, buccal, dermatological (including iontophoresis/phonophoresis), gingival, nasal, ophthalmic and perianal disorders are not prohibited and require neither a TUE nor a declaration of use. Of course, the interpretation of analysed urine samples showing the presence of glucocorticoids is complicated by this mix of regulations.

AB - Amongst athletes, participation in sports brings its own unique form of stress, not only before important contests but also due to frequent competitive events. Though a certain amount of pre-competition anxiety is inevitable, the anxiety response varies enormously between individuals, with some people coping extremely poorly. Many find their own solutions to attenuate anxiety levels, without exogenous aids. Anxiety may adversely affect performance, especially in activities highly demanding of mental concentration and steadiness of limbs. This likely impairment has prompted the use of anti-anxiety drugs, although some are not permitted in many sports. In this chapter the relationship between anxiety and sport performance is first explored. The next section concentrates on alcohol, its metabolism in the body and its effect on the central nervous system. Next, the interactions between alcohol and health are considered. Its impact on physiological responses to exercise and its uses in aiming sports (such as archery, billiards, darts, pistol shooting and snooker) are then examined. Finally, the relationships between alcohol and sports accidents are addressed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)

AB - This chapter responds to the call for research that is inclusive and respectful. To achieve culturally inclusive and competent research, an advisory group was established and several processes implemented to ensure Indigenous voices are involved in formulation and execution of the research. To ensure and sustain engagement was difficult and often not possible. However, there is much more that needs to be done to promote culturally inclusive research. For example, we can extend processes for participation and inclusion by using "talking circles" and "community meetings" or similar grounded techniques for information gathering and sharing. Having greater community involvement would have enriched the current study and strengthened collaboration. Nevertheless, the current study provides a glimpse into the experiences of 10 Indigenous Australian footballers and how they have negotiated their relocation experiences away from their home and into mainstream cultural settings. Although social and economic indicators continue to point to disparities between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australian wellbeing, this study provide examples of stories of strength, perseverance, and patience. Importantly, from the research there is indication that the footballers must negotiate multiple transitions as they become professional footballers. Recognizing and understanding these dynamic transitions is important because at the heart of the transition and settlement process is the ongoing struggle to protect and strengthen Indigenous cultural identities within a broader context of race relations ~ Australian Football League clubs provide the setting for these negotiations.

AB - In this chapter, we describe the evolution of a program of research on coaching behaviors and interventions that has spanned more than three decades and has resulted in an empirically supported coach training program. We describe the manner in which a theoretical model derived from the areas of learning, social and personality psychology, and developmental psychology has helped guide a program of basic and applied research. Research results derived from the basic and applied research has guided the intervention program's development, and research results from basic research and program evaluations address important theoretical issues. In order to measure leadership behaviors, the authors developed the Coaching Behavior Assessment System. The theoretical model assumes that the effects of coaching behaviors will be mediated by athletes' perceptions and recall of the behaviors. The Player-perceived Behavior scale was designed to measure these. A study with 51 male Little League Baseball coaches indicated that players responded more favorably to coaches who engaged in higher percentages of supportive and instructional behaviors. A third phase consisting of the Coach Effectiveness Training and the Mastery Approach to Coaching compared 18 trained Little League Baseball coaches with 13 untrained coaches. Results include a discussion of performance anxiety, self-esteem and achievement goal orientation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)

AB - This chapter discusses over-the-counter (OCT) agents and their use regarding performance enhancement in sports. Regulation by the World Anti-Doping Agency is also discussed. Whilst there are countless drugs available over the counter, stimulants are typically deemed to be potential performance enhancers in sport. For this reason there are currently a number of OTC stimulants whose use is prohibited in sport. Many of these stimulants, known collectively as sympathomimetic amines, are contained in numerous OTC preparations for the treatment of symptoms associated with upper respiratory tract (URT) conditions, such as the common cold, sinusitis and seasonal rhinitis. In addition, methylxanthines, including caffeine and related substances, are stimulants commonly found in OTC preparations; however, their use is permitted in sport. Products designed specifically to increase alertness and combat drowsiness typically contain methylxanthines. Also, both sympathomimetic amines and methylxanthines are common constituents of products designed to promote weight loss. In addition to being present within OTC pharmaceutical preparations, such stimulants are also commonly available in their naturally occurring botanical forms as herbal preparations. From an anti-doping perspective it would seem that the availability and general lack of control surrounding the use of over-the-counter (OTC) stimulants (in both their pharmaceutical and botanical forms) pose the most difficult problem in regulating their use. Sympathomimetic amines and methylxanthines contained in OTC medications have clear therapeutic roles in alleviating the symptoms of URT conditions. In therapeutic doses these sympathomimetics are typically devoid of adverse side effects and performance-enhancing properties. Even in supratherapeutic doses research has found it difficult to elucidate the performance-enhancement properties of these drugs. However, pseudoephedrine and ephedrine (both commonly available OTC stimulants) are prohibited in competition. As a consequence of the principle of strict liability there is a huge responsibility for ensuring that athletes are aware of these stimulants and the products that contain them. This responsibility lies with the athletes and their support personnel. These issues are even more pertinent when the use of herbal preparations is considered. Due to the limited research into the efficacy of these products and the general lack of regulations surrounding their quality and therefore their safety, it is advisable that athletes are warned against using such products.

AB - This chapter examines how the physical and mental challenges inherent in exercise, games, and sport may affect the neurological underpinnings of children's executive functions, which constitute the ability to reason, plan, and execute problem-solving strategies. A developmental neuropsychological approach is taken to explain how physical activity may interact with children's emerging brain structures, their functions, and plasticity. The results of a number of recently conducted studies that examine the effects of exercise on children's and adults' executive function are presented. On the basis of these studies, the emergence of executive functions in children is hypothesized to be determined, at least in part, by the context in which movement skills are learned and by the learner's level of mental engagement. The benefits of such training may be far reaching, as foundational executive processes appear to play important roles across multiple domains and may be critical to success; not only on the playing field but also performing in academic tasks and real-world conditions that involve behavior inhibition, working memory, and strategy.

AB - Concussions in sports typically arise from a hard blow to the head. In soccer, for example, head-to-head impacts carry a high risk for concussion. In the National Football League (NFL), an injury reconstruction study revealed that a striking player often lines up his head, neck, and torso to deliver maximum force to the other player in helmet-to-helmet impacts that result in concussive injuries to the player being struck. Fortunately, most injuries in sports fall on the milder end of the spectrum of mild traumatic brain injuries (MTBI). Occasionally, however, athletes experience complicated mild, moderate, or severe traumatic brain injuries. In equestrian and auto racing, for example, accidents can result in much more serious injuries to the brain. According to the American Academy of Neurology (AAN): "Concussion is a trauma-induced alteration in mental status that may or may not include a loss of consciousness". Following a Concussion in Sport conference in Vienna, the following definition was published: "Concussion is defined as a complex pathophysiological process affecting the brain, induced by traumatic biomechanical forces". The features of this injury are defined below. 1) Concussion may be caused either by a direct blow to the head, face, neck, or elsewhere on the body with an "impulsive" force transmitted to the head. 2) Concussion typically results in the rapid onset of short-lived impairment of neurological function that resolves spontaneously. 3) Concussion may result in neuropathological changes, but the acute clinical symptoms largely reflect a functional disturbance rather than structural injury. 4) Concussion results in a graded set of clinical symptoms that may or may not involve loss of consciousness. 5) Resolution of the clinical and cognitive symptoms typically follows a sequential course. 6) Concussion is typically associated with grossly normal structural neuroimaging studies. This chapter discusses sports-related concussions including neurobiology and pathophysiology; recovery time; classification systems; multiple concussions; emerging evidenced-based neuropsychology; and finally, returning to play.

AB - Time constraints in ball sports encourage players to take advantage of any relevant advance information available to prepare their actions. Advance information, therefore, can serve to prime movement parameters (e.g. movement direction) and reduce the amount of time required to prepare the upcoming movement. Regularly, however, players face situations in which the information used to prepare the action turns out to be outdated just prior to movement initiation and the prepared action needs to be changed as soon as possible. The aim of the experiment presented here was to determine whether the priming effect , generally reported for reaction time tasks, could be generalised to interceptive actions. A secondary aim was to examine the strategies employed by the participants to cope with valid, invalid, or no advance information. The results indicate that, when available, the participants used advance information to prepare their movements. More specifically, in comparison with valid advance information, hit rate and spatial accuracy were reduced when the participants had no advance information and were even smaller when the information conveyed was invalid. The results also suggest that in the absence of valid advance information, the strategies employed to intercept the moving target were tuned to the time remaining until the interception was due to occur.

AB - The popularity of sport psychology, both as an academic discipline and an applied practice, has grown substantially over the past two decades. Few within the realm of competitive athletics would argue with the importance of being mentally prepared prior to an athletic competition as well as the need to maintain that particular mindset during a competitive contest. Nevertheless, recent research has shown that many athletes, coaches, and sporting administrators are still quite reluctant to seek out the services of a qualified sport psychologist, even if they believe it could help. One of the primary reasons for this hesitation appears to be a lack of understanding about the process and the mechanisms by which these mental skills affect performance. Unlike the “harder sciences” of sport physiology and biochemistry where athletes can see the tangible results in themselves or other athletes (e.g., he or she lifted weights, developed larger muscles, and is now stronger/faster as a result), the unfamiliar and often esoteric nature of sport psychology appears to be impeding a large number of athletes from soliciting these important services. As such, the purpose of this article is to provide the reader with a simple framework depicting how mental skills training translates into improved within-competition performance. This framework is intended to help bridge the general “understanding gap” that is currently being reported by a large number of athletes and coaches, while also helping sport psychology practitioners sell their valuable services to individual athletes and teams.

AB - The development of a pre-performance routine continues to be an intuitively appealing and widely accepted technique to enhance preparation for performance in sport. However, actual understanding falls somewhat short of that required to recommend with confidence the development of a pre-performance routine. At a fundamental level it is still not clear what function routines fulfil, what they should consist of or the most effective way to teach them. This review seeks to clarify current understanding and highlight areas requiring further attention. Greater understanding is required to understand the psychological components of routines as well as understanding the process through which a routine is developed/taught.

AB - This study explores the antecedents, mechanisms, influencing variables, and consequences of choking in sport and identifies interventions that may alleviate choking. Through the use of qualitative methods, the experiences of six elite golfers who choked frequently under pressure were examined and compared with five elite golfers who excelled frequently under pressure. The perspectives of four coaches who had worked extensively with elite golfers who had choked and excelled, were also considered. The study indicated that the participants choked as a result of distraction, which was caused by various stressors. Self-confidence, preparation, and perfectionism were identified as key influencing variables of the participants’ choking episodes, and the consequence of choking was a significant drop in performance that affected negatively future performances. Process goals, cognitive restructuring, imagery, simulated training, and a pre/postshot routine were perceived as interventions that may possibly prevent choking.

AB - This study examined the applicability of confidence profiling to the development of an individualized intervention designed in accordance with Murphy and Murphy’s (1992) eight step cognitive-behavioral model. The case study design illustrated the potential uses and benefits of confidence profiling when developing an athlete driven intervention to enhance the sport confidence of a female swimmer. Specifically, it showed how confidence profiling can act as an applied measure to accurately assess sport confidence from the athlete’s own perspective, provide the basis of an intervention targeted toward the athlete’s individual confidence needs, and provide feedback to the sport psychologist concerning the effectiveness of the intervention. A postintervention interview with the athlete highlighted the usefulness of the confidence profiling process. Specifically, the profiling process helped to raise the athlete’s awareness of the factors that facilitated and debilitated her sport confidence. Furthermore, the athlete reported feeling more confident and very satisfied with the mental skills training, which she perceived resulted in performance gains.

AB - This paper tested the relationship between mental toughness and attitudes towards risk-taking in undergraduate student athletes attending two Universities in the North of England. A sample of 69 men ( M age = 22.2 years, s = 5.28) and 36 women ( M age = 24.6 years, s = 7.67) participated and ranged from club to national level in a variety of sports. Participants gave informed consent before completing questionnaires to assess mental toughness and attitudes towards risk. Pearson Product Moment Correlations found significant and positive correlations between overall mental toughness and attitudes towards physical risks, but no relationship with psychological risk. Regression analysis found the mental toughness subscale of challenge to be the most significant predictor of attitudes towards physical risk. Interpersonal confidence was the only mental toughness subscale found to be significantly and positively related to attitudes towards psychological risk. Independent t -tests found men reported significantly higher overall mental toughness, confidence in abilities, and attitudes towards both physical and psychological risk, than women. These results are discussed with regard to previous research findings and future researchers are encouraged to consider employing experimental methodologies in order to manipulate contextual factors to more fully understand any individual differences.

AB - This article discusses athletic insight from an international sport psychology perspective. It is fundamental for this perspective to emphasize the functional interrelation of mental processes, for example, cognitive and affective processes, a dialectic relation of external and internal factors, the objective and subjective world and the construction of the action situation by a person environment task constellation. To some extent it is a definitional issue to differentiate cognitive and affective processes properly, but already Piaget explained that cognitive and affective processes represent two sides of one coin, that is, these two fundamental processes cannot be regarded independently. Maybe it is a meaningful conclusion to highlight that both, cognitive and affective processes, are representing complex sub-systems which are interrelated in manifold ways. The relation between a person and the environment is constitutive for human life. To organize and manage this relation to optimize it with regard to the individual needs and to bring it in a better fit is characteristic for human beings and the general purpose of actions. Based on this understanding the general objectives in sports and exercise to maximize performance and well being only can be achieved by an approach to optimize the person environment task fit.

AB - The aim of this study is to identify psychological skills in fencers according to different training and competition situations, as well as to establish experience influence when practicing sport. 40 absolute Spanish national ranking fencers (24 women and 16 men; age: M = 23.17, dt = 8.92) were evaluated. The evaluation system used was the Pmeba para Evaluar Rasgos Psicológicos en Deportistas Versión Revisada (PAR P1-R; Serrate, 2006). The group has shown excellent skills in competitive challenge (M = 7.95, dt = 1.86) and emotional sensitivity (M = 4.22, dt = 2.57), but a need of improvement in self-assuredness, motivation, positive attitude, concentration, and imagination. When comparing fencers according to their sport experience significant differences arise in fencers with highest experience in attention (p = 0.04) and emotional sensitivity (p = 0.03). However, they experience less motivation (p = 0.01) in practicing. Results highlight the need of psychological intervention in fencers' preparation systems in order to improve psychological skills and, therefore, achieve maximum competence development and an optimum performiance profile in their sport.

AB - This article critically discusses the use of movement, games and sport in cooperation for development, in post conflict rehabilitation and in the context of violence, disaster and conflict. Pointing out the ambivalent nature of sport and its limitations, we conclude that, if we really want to achieve an impact through movement, games and sport, we should use them as tools with concrete strategies according to specific goals, local context and based on the interests, needs and leadership of the participants. In addition, we argue that in psychosocial intervention, sport is even more powerful combined with other movement, educational or therapeutic methods, and interventions. In spite of a few interesting evaluation and research projects, which we discuss briefly in this article, we still generally lack knowledge about the effects of the applied strategies. Nevertheless, we conclude that there are some possible key factors and basic aspects to contribute to the development of pertinent and effective projects using the potential of movement, games and sport in psychosocial interventions within cooperation for development. We also highlight the importance of the relationship with, and between, the participants and the active, dynamic and participatory character of the intervention.

AB - The objective of this study was to evaluate a resilience-enhancing program for youth (mean age = 13.32 years) from Beslan, North Ossetia, in the Russian Federation. The program, offered in the summer of 2006, combined recreation, sport, and psychosocial rehabilitation activities for 94 participants, 46 of who were taken hostage in the 2004 school tragedy and experienced those events first hand. Self-reported resilience, as measured by the CD-RISC, was compared within subjects at the study baseline and at two follow-up assessments: immediately after the program and 6 months later. We also compared changes in resilience levels across groups that differed in their traumatic experiences. The results indicate a significant intra-participant mean increase in resilience at both follow-up assessments, and greater self-reported improvements in resilience processes for participants who experienced more trauma events.

AB - This study investigated attitudes toward Native-themed mascots in the context of color-blind racial attitudes. Results indicate that higher color-blind racial attitudes are related to lower awareness of the offensiveness of Native-themed mascots. The researchers tested the effectiveness of a training intervention designed to produce attitudinal change among master's level counseling students. Results demonstrate that the training intervention produced significantly greater attitudinal change than did a general training session on culturally sensitive counseling practices with American Indian clients, particularly among students with high color-blind racial attitudes. Results also indicate that this training intervention on Native-themed mascots contributed to lower color-blind racial attitudes, thus increasing the students' awareness of societal racism. Psychological training programs may benefit from augmenting their multicultural counseling curriculum by specifically addressing the offensive nature of Native-themed mascots. An awareness of the marginalization of American Indians, particularly as it involves racialized mascots, can reduce color-blind racial attitudes, and may provide psychologists with a more comprehensive understanding of aspects of the reality of American Indian clients that contribute to their worldview.

AB - The term ‘sport intelligence’ was first introduced by cognitive sport psychologists (e.g., Fisher, 1984; Tenenbaum and Bar-Eli, 1993, 1995) in reference to the ability of athletes to solve problems and make decisions while taking part in competition. More recent definitions (e.g., Gould, Dieffenbach & Moffet, 2002) propose sport intelligence to include components beyond in-competition decision making. In general, despite its apparent practical and theoretical importance, sport intelligence is a relatively underexplored phenomenon. This dissertation is an exploratory investigation of the components of ‘sport intelligence’ in the context of golf. In-depth, semi-structured qualitative interviews were performed with 16 experienced and expert golf coaches. The participants were prompted to create their own definitions of sport intelligence in golf based on their expertise and experiences. Also, participants assessed the suitability of components included in previous definitions of sport intelligence for the golf context. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, and data was analyzed using both inductive and deductive methods. For example, data from exploratory portions of the interview were analyzed inductively while data from portions of the interview that directly referenced components previously included in definitions of sport intelligence were analyzed deductively. Analysis of interview data indicated that the components of sport intelligence in golf could be separated into two separate and somewhat distinct sets of cognitive and emotional skills. “Competitive intelligence” included cognitive and emotional processes that took place on the course during competition. Themes that described the components of competitive intelligence in the golf context were (a) Self-Knowledge, (b) Self-Awareness, (c) Environmental Perception, (d) Information Processing, (e) Course Management, (f) Cognitive Control, and (g) Understanding the Nature of Golf. “Developmental intelligence” included cognitive and emotional processes that took place during training and/or preparation and influenced the long-term development of a player. The components of developmental intelligence were (a) Self-Knowledge, (b) Self-Regulation, (c) Attitude for Development, and (d) Understanding of the Elite Sport Process. Theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed, and future directions for research are suggested. The possible significance of developmental intelligence for talent development across sports is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - In Taiwan, technology is constantly advancing, and the percentage of people with higher education levels is increasing. Both physical and mental strength are needed to thrive in one of the fastest-paced economies in the world. People must consider how to lead a healthy life in order to be more productive in the workforce. In recent years, the number of sports centers in Taiwan has grown rapidly due to social needs and the awareness of the importance of having a healthy mind and body. In short, the general social and economic environment in Taiwan has been transformed and has become conducive to the growth of a multiple sports industry. However, some sports centers are very successful, and some are not. A question has arisen in Taiwan's sports environment regarding the connection between the leadership practices of managers and the satisfaction of customers. Very little research has been conducted to examine executive and employee behaviors, customer expectations and satisfaction, and the increasing popularity of sports centers. This research aimed to provide help to the managers of Taiwan's sports industries so that they may look for ways to improve managerial efficiency and increase customer satisfaction. The sample questionnaires were answered by the managers of six sports centers, following the government's Operation-Transfer model. Surveys were administered to approximately 1,500 customers and 240 workers from the six sports centers. This study addressed two main concerns about the future needs of Taiwan's sports industry. These two concerns dealt with the leadership practices of managers and the customers' satisfaction at the sports centers which operate with the OT model. The results of this study were delivered to the managers of Taiwan's sports centers, providing them with knowledge to enhance their professional practice. The results of this study, Spearman rho correlations and MANOVAs clarify the relationships between Inspiring Shared Visions and satisfaction with Tangibles and Empathy and relationship between Enabling Others to Act and satisfaction with Responsiveness and Empathy in sports centers. Employee performance directly affects the satisfaction of the customers of the sports centers. Customer satisfaction with Empathy correlated with all factors of leadership practice and Inspiring Shared Visions had strongest correlation with customer satisfaction.

AB - Anecdotal evidence indicates that athletes encounter in their careers various changes that interfere with their "comfortable zone of functioning," or their "athletic status quo." For example, Roy Keane, Ireland national soccer team's captain, had a dispute with his coach and squad during the preparation camp for the 2002 World Cup, and decided to leave the team; Jeremy Wariner, the 400-meter 2004 Olympic Champion changed both his coach and his shoes the year prior to the Beijing Olympic Games, and lost his title. During these transitional periods, change can occur in diverse levels of the athletic experience, such as the identity, personal, performance, physiological, technical, and technological levels. While these and other stories emphasize the importance of understanding athletes' experiences of situations of change, hardly any empirical evidence exists on the magnitude and meaning of this aspect of the athletic career. Additionally, there is a shortage of comprehensive conceptual models in sport psychology to explain how athletes experience, and cope with, situations that require them to initiate psychological and/or behavioral change. The present study, therefore, was an initial attempt to validate a new conceptual framework of change-event experiences in athletes' careers. Specifically, the study was focused on identifying the frequency in which athletes experience various change-events, portraying the characteristics of change-events in terms of perception and reaction, and examining the associated coping and decision-making processes. Hence, this study was a response to an existing theoretical and practical need in the area of athletic career transitions to critically account for potential events influencing athletes' lives that are not explained by the traditional career stage models. The scheme of change for sport psychology practice (SCSPP) is a new conceptual framework in which typical characteristics of change situations that challenge athletes to respond with matching personal adaptations or reactive change are described. It involves a three-stage process of change including the appearance of certain change-events, the athlete's perception and appraisal of these events, and his or her reaction to and coping with the events. The conceptual framework underlying the SCSPP focuses on two dimensions: (a) the situational stages that unfold as athletes encounter and cope with changes in their athletic status quo, and (b) the therapeutic process that might facilitate an effective personal change. It is suggested that certain personal characteristics (e.g., athletic identity, competitive level, capacity for change ), as well as particular aspects of the change process, might affect athletes' ability to effectively cope with change-events, and resolve them in a satisfying manner. In this context, it is assumed that when athletes turn to consult with others, and are motivated to make the necessary adjustments involved in initiating a matching personal change in response to a change-event, they will also be more likely to cope effectively with the event and resolve it successfully, given that the necessary environmental conditions exist. Pilot preparation for this investigation of the proposed conceptual framework was focused on developing a new survey (The Change-Event Inventory; CEI) to enable exploring athletes' experiences of change-events, as well as on validating the general structure of the SCSPP. While results were largely encouraging, several limitations were identified in the structure and content of the CEI. Additionally, results indicated that the use of coping strategies is a significant factor that should be assessed as part of athletes' change-event experiences. The purpose of the present study was to explore athletes' change-event experiences from a broad conceptual and methodological perspective.

This book represents a fine work in the field of sport psychology, which connects theories and practice and emphasizes practical application. This edited book is organized in 10 themes containing 30 case studies, which are all based on issues of psychological adjustment that are most commonly observed in athletic training and competition. All the 30 cases were derived from actual classic stories of Chinese athletes’ success in winning Olympic gold medals. The value of this book not only lies in the interpretation of Olympic Spirits from a psychological approach, but also in guiding overseas readers through their contemplation of particular philosophies of athletes’ psychological preparation and adjustment prior to major competitions in the context of Chinese culture.

AB - Although a considerable amount of research provides insight into why people participate in high altitude mountaineering, it neglects to consider how climbers stay motivated and surmount the obstacles that are inherent in the activity when they perform on the mountain. Through this ethnographic study, we explored the multidimensional experience of feel and motivation of a small group of Mount Everest climbers ( N = 4) as they scaled the mountain in order to shed light on factors that sustained their drive toward reaching their goals. The qualitative data collected via participant observation and multiple interviews was subjected to a content mode of analysis. Results revealed that the climbers’ motivation was influenced by the various ways in which they felt on the mountain. Differences and similarities between the felt experiences of the recreational and elite climbers, and their ability to regulate how they felt through preparation and how they responded to obstacles in order to sustain their motivation, are discussed.

AB - The study aimed to examine the types of coping strategies preferred by adolescent competition tennis players and specific attention was paid to understanding these strategies' perceived effectiveness and the coping strategy's subsequent effects on well-being. The sample for the study was made up of 27 adolescent tennis players with a mean age of 15 years who participate at a high competitive level. The Approach to Coping in Sport Questionnaire (ACSQ-1) was used to measure the coping strategy used by the players and their psychological well-being was assessed by the Psychological Well- Being Scale. The results indicated that the emotional calming strategy was the tennis players' preferred coping strategy in general. At the same time, emotional calming and active planning were the strategies the players' considered to be the most effective in terms of improving performance. An additional finding was that players with lower levels of self-acceptance relied more heavily on the emotional calming strategy and those with higher levels of self-acceptance used mental distancing more frequently. Players who perceived greater environmental control relied more heavily upon mental distancing as their preferred coping strategy. These findings indicate that individual differences were present in terms of preferred coping strategies and that the strategies produced differentiated effects on well-being for young competition tennis players.

AB - Do either instantly applied relaxation methods or a quickly executed cognitive method help climbing novices to control their state anxiety?We used Lichstein’s (1988) Deep Breathing Technique or Meichenbaum’s (1977a, 1977b) Self Instruction Training technique as methods to reduce anxiety in climbing novices immediately before climbing their first route. State anxiety was measured by using an anxiety thermometer (Houtman & Bakker, 1989); as additional indicators of anxiety we measured heart rate and climbing velocity (see Pijpers et al., 2003). The heart rate decreased after the instructions were given, which shows the efficacy of the manipulation. Compared to a control group, neither of the techniques showed anxiety-reducing effects for the novices during climbing. Therefore, instantly applied manipulations for reducing anxiety do not seem to have an effect, and long-term preparation as well as training of the interventions seem to be necessary for anxiety reduction.

AB - Achievements related to human performance have recently surpassed what was once thought possible. In part, these developments are due to greater understanding of the scientific factors that underpin performance in tasks related to all aspects of human movement. This has included advances in varied academic domains such as exercise physiology, nutrition, strength and conditioning, psychology, ergonomics and physical therapy. This book presents recent research in the field that provides a bridge between scientific knowledge and practitioners involved in the enhancement of human performance. Short communication A presents data on psychological aspects of nutritional manipulation with an examination of the placebo effect of caffeine on sport specific skill performance. Short communication B provides the reader with an insight into the role of hiking poles of the physiological responses to uphill walking, thus illustrating how particular equipment may influence human exertional performance and short communication C identifies positional differences in the anthropometric profiles of junior ice-hockey players which has possible application to the development of sport specific training programs and talent identification in ice-hockey. It is hoped that this text provides a broad and balanced overview of a range of topics relevant to individuals working within the field of human performance. Whilst this field is vast in terms of the disciplines it encompasses, the chapters in this book are drawn from a range of disciplines including exercise physiology, nutrition, physical activity, biomechanics, psychology and sports therapy and rehabilitation. Hopefully, the information presented here will prompt discussion, further research and stimulate further improvements in the scientific enhancement of human performance.

AB - Recent research has indicated improved aerobic performance after caffeine consumption. However, few studies have examined placebo effects on skilled sports performance. The aim of this study was to examine the placebo effect of caffeine on motor skill performance. Following ethics approval and informed consent, 9 male and 7 female university hockey players (mean age = 21 ± 1.8 years) volunteered to participate. Participants completed a hockey skills test under 3 conditions: control, placebo and a caffeine condition. However, no caffeine was administered, instead a deceptive administration protocol was used and 300ml of an orange flavored drink was consumed 30 minutes prior to testing in both the placebo and caffeine conditions. During each condition, participants completed the Chapman Test protocol as a measure of hockey ball handling ability and provided RPE indicators. Results indicated there were significant differences in stick handling ability across the three conditions (P = 0.001). Bonferroni post hoc tests indicated that performance was better in the perceived caffeine condition compared to the control condition (P = 0.01), and in the perceived caffeine condition compared to the perceived placebo condition (P = 0.024). Scores in the perceived placebo condition were also significantly better compared with the control condition (P = 0.009). RPE scores were higher in the control condition compared to both the perceived caffeine (P = 0.01) and perceived placebo conditions (P = 0.01). The results suggest that when participants believed they had consumed caffeine, hockey skill improved in comparison to perceived placebo and control conditions.

AB - The purpose of the present study was to compare the use of hiking poles on physiological responses to walking at various uphill gradients. This was conducted on a treadmill at various inclined gradients (0, 10 and 20%). Ten participants (mean age = 26 ± .5 years) walked for 15 minutes at 0, 10 and 20% gradients, on two separate occasions, once with hiking poles and once without in a randomised order. Participants carried a backpack weighing 9.5kg during all trials. Oxygen uptake, heart rate, blood lactate and rate of perceived exertion were assessed throughout. A 2 (conditions) X 3 (gradients) way repeated measures ANOVA was used to examine the differences in each variable across conditions. Results indicated that there were no significant differences in oxygen uptake ( F 1.9 = 1.98, P = 1.93), blood lactate ( F 1.5 = 3.65, P = 0.572), heart rate ( F 1.8 = 6.827, P = 0.732) or RPE ( F 1.9 = 1.095, P = 0.323) when comparing the poles condition to the no-poles condition. The results suggest that using hiking poles with respect to varying uphill gradients may not cause the increased work rate as some research suggests. However, conclusions are limited due to the ecological validity of walking on a treadmill, as opposed to an ecologically valid environment.

AB - The objectives of the present study were to investigate the anthropometric characteristics of elite Junior ice-hockey players. Eighteen ice-hockey players from a British 'Elite Hockey League' academy (mean age ± S.D. = 15.8 + 1.2 years) were assessed on a number of anthropometric variables. Somatotype was assessed using the Heath- Carter method and body composition (% body fat) was assessed using surface anthropometry. Results indicated that defencemen were significantly taller than the forwards ( P = 0.009), had greater body mass and a higher percent body fat compared to the forwards. These were not significantly different (P > 0.05), however the difference in body mass represented a large effect (d = 0.83). Defencemen were also significantly more endomorphic (P = 0.047) than forwards. Overall, defencemen were classed as endomorphic mesomorphs and forwards were classified as ectomorphic mesomorphs. These results indicate the need for sports scientists and conditioning professionals to take the kinathropometric characteristics of ice-hockey players into account when designing individualised position specific training programmes.

AB - Studies investigating the effect of caffeine ingestion on short-term high-intensity exercise performance are equivocal and few studies have investigated the effect of caffeine on rowing performance. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of caffeine ingestion on short-term rowing performance. Ten males and two females (mean age ± S.D. = 22.4 ± 2.6 years) volunteered to participate in this study and completed a 1000-metre (m) rowing test on three occasions in a randomised order. The first condition was a control where no solution was consumed, 5mg kg -1 caffeine diluted into 250ml of artificially sweetened water was consumed in the second condition and the third condition was a placebo condition where 250ml of artificially sweetened water was consumed. In both cases, solutions were consumed 60 minutes prior to exercise testing. Repeated measures ANOVA indicated that 1000m rowing time was greater in the control condition compared to the caffeine condition (P = 0.01) but there was no difference between the placebo and caffeine conditions (P = 0.11). There were no differences in peak heart rate across conditions (P = 0.79). RPE values were however, significantly lower in the caffeine condition compared to the control (P = 0.002) and the placebo condition (P = 0.01). These results indicate that caffeine ingestion may have a role in dampening the perception of exertion during short-term, high-intensity rowing performance but that improved rowing time may be a result of a placebo effect as much as the ergogenic effect of caffeine itself.

AB - The aim of this study is to examine basic leg extensor isometric F-t curve characteristics obtained by testing in standing position. The sample consisted of 5 different sub-samples: power lifters (N = 22), karate athletes (N = 9), judokas (N = 10), well trained athletes (N = 39), and a control group (N = 31). Six contractile characteristics were investigated: F maxIZO —the level of maximal isometric force; tF maxIZO —the time necessary for achieving maximal isometric force; RFD FmaxIZO —an index of basic isometric explosive force i.e. the isometric rate of force developement; F rellZO —the relative value of the achieved maximal force; RFD FrellZO —the relative value of isometric rate of force developement; and RFD/F max —an index which determines the level of development of basic isometric explosive force from the aspect of biological potential. Regarding all individual contractile parametres, the results showed that there is a statistically significant differences (p < 0.001) between the sub-samples. Regarding all standardized differences, where the criterion represented the result of control group, F maxIZO in power lifters is 65.34%, in karate athletes is 11.41%, in judokas 22.58%, and at well trained population 15.12% bigger. Regarding RED FmaxIZO in power lifters, the obtained value was 243.80%, in karate athletes 118.36%, in judokas 129.17% and in the well-trained group was 43.33% higher that the control group. From the point of view of RFD/F max value, the obtained value in power lifters was 243.80%, in karate athletes 118.36%, in judokas 129.17% and in the well-trained group was 43.33% higher than the control group. According to the obtained analyses here related to F-t curve leg extensor characteristics, it is possible to define initial model indicators for six tested contractile characteristics in tested athletes and well-trained populations.

AB - The use of a variable resistance (VR) combined with a traditional resistance exercise (TRE) has become increasingly popular amongst strength and conditioning practitioners as a method of training. Mostly anecdotal, the evidence has suggested that the addition of chains can improve strength and power, extend the duration of the acceleration phase and subsequently increase velocity during the concentric phase of a lift. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the combined acute effects of chain and TRE on force and power characteristics during the parallel back squat exercise. Following ethical approval and informed consent, six recreationally trained male sport and exercise science students (Mean age ± S.D. = 22.0 ± 1.9 years) performed single, maximal effort repetitions of the parallel back squat during 3 testing sessions using the following loading conditions: Session 1, baseline measures; Session 2, condition 1-60% of 1-RM TRE; condition 2-60% of 1-RM TRE as well as an additional 20% of chains (VR); condition 3- 60% of 1-RM TRE and an additional 35% of chains (VR); Session 3, condition 4-85% of 1-RM TRE; condition 5-85% of 1-RM TRE as well as an additional 20% of chains (VR); condition 6-85% of 1-RM TRE and an additional 35% of chains (VR). All sessions were conducted 72 hours apart to account for fatigue effects. A ballistic measurement system (Fittech, Australia) calculated force and power characteristics. One-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed significant differences (p = 0.001) in peak force production between TRE and all VR conditions at 60% and 85% of 1-RM. Further analysis also revealed significant increases (p = 0.04) in the maximal rate of force development between TRE and 60% of 1-RM and an additional 20% of chains (condition 2). The acute effects of supplementing chains with TRE may enhance acceleration during the initial concentric phase of the squat, promote power output and elevate neural drive in recreationally trained athletes. However, coaches must acknowledge the limitations in chain training until conclusive evidence is presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)

AB - This chapter deals with the role of sensorimotor exercises in sports training and rehabilitation. Both acute and adaptive changes in neuromuscular performance due to various forms of intervention are addressed. These include serial mechanical proprioceptive stimulation, task-oriented sensorimotor exercises, and those performed on unstable support surfaces. While instability agility and resistance exercises are effective for improvement of neuromuscular performance in athletes and healthly subjects, visual feedback exercise seems to be a promising tool for retraining balance function in individuals after injury. It may be of potential use also in elderly populations, for decreasing risk of falling and reduction of health-related consequences.

AB - Exercise that meets guidelines for duration, frequency and intensity can provide health and performance benefits. Interactive video games or exergaming may thus provide an opportunity to enhance physical activity levels that would not normally be obtained with traditional means of exercise. This may be feasible taking into account the popularity of interactive games such as the Nintendo Wii Sports. In this chapter, studies will be reviewed that focussed on the physiological demands of Nintendo Wii Sports. Only studies that reported direct measurements of oxygen uptake or other means of predicting energy expenditure by playing Nintendo Wii Sports were discussed. Also, potential issues related to the physiological demands when playing Nintendo Wii Sports such as gender and body mass are identified. The main take home message from this chapter is that enhancement of human performance or improvement of health by regular interactive game play (i.e. exercise) must meet physiological requirements. It remains uncertain, however, whether individuals would intentionally implement regular interactive play to obtain health and performance benefits. Future work on physiological demands of playing interactive video games in the community may reveal the potential for enhancement of exercise performance and health.

AB - The purpose of this paper is to examine the efficacy of using augmented eccentric loading (AEL) as an alternative training approach for athletes and weight trainers involved in strength and power development. The practice of incorporating AEL into resistance exercise is still relatively new and although limited, there is evidence that supports the contention that AEL may lead to both superior acute and chronic adaptations over more traditional methods. AEL involves coupled concentric and overloaded eccentric muscle actions, and attempts to optimise the muscular adaptations associated with stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) activities. Examples of exercises that can be performed with an eccentric-enhanced resistance include: plyometric drop/depth jumps. jumps in place, squats, squat jumps, lunges, bench press and bench throws. Due to the 'stop-start' nature of AEL exercises, cluster set configurations (i.e., inter-repetition rest intervals) maybe used as a means for implementing AEL into a periodised training plan. The inter-repetition rest interval may improve the quality of each AEL repetition when compared with more traditional set structures by offsetting the affects of fatigue. More research into concentric and eccentric relative loading as well as the rate of eccentric loading is necessary to further define its role within the weight training and strength and conditioning communities. However, it is possible that enhanced training effects may be achieved if increased eccentric loads are implemented into periodised strength-training programs.

AB - The prospect of fame and fortune are among the leading factors that influence athletes to use substances. These factors usually override both legal and medical pitfalls that may arise while an athlete is using performance-enhancing drugs. The actual or perceived benefits drive the athlete to continue their drug habits, often to the detriment of their health. With fortunes to be made in supplying athletes with substances, both illicit and for doping, it is no surprise that trafficking and distribution of substances is dominated by organized crime, multinational pharmaceutical companies, both legitimate (e.g., BALCO) and clandestine, and even rogue governments; with physicians, pharmacists, other athletes and the Internet playing a major role in athletes' relative ease of access to these substances. With new developments in masking techniques for steroid users, gene doping and designer street drugs, all parties involved, including lawyers, physicians and administrators, must continue to increase their knowledge base to be effective in their endeavors to control substance use in athletes. This chapter will discuss the historical perspective of drug use among athletes, elaborate on the reasons athletes use substances, and detail both specific performance-enhancing and recreational drugs.

AB - The purpose of this study was to conduct a qualitative exploration of the substitute role in an attempt to uncover detailed understanding of soccer players' experiences. Twenty soccer substitutes were individually interviewed. Inductive content analysis revealed that they experienced mainly negative organizational, person and competitive factors as substitutes, with fewer positive experiences. Organizational factors were: receiving short notice, segregation, poor coach communication, inactivity and restricted preparation. Person factors were: dissatisfaction with status, self-presentation and impression motivation concerns, reduced control over performance and coach's decisions, reduced motivation to prepare, negative emotions and elevated state anxiety. Positive responses were: role acceptance, remaining focused, enthusiastic and confident and performing well.

AB - Fatigue is often a consequence of physical training and the effective management of fatigue by the coach and athlete is essential in optimizing adaptation and performance. In this paper, we explore a range of practical and contemporary methods of fatigue management for Olympic athletes. We assesses the scientific merit of methods for monitoring fatigue, including self-assessment of training load, self-scored questionnaires, and the usefulness of saliva and blood diagnostic markers for indicating fatigued and under-recovered athletes, effective nutrition and hydration strategies for optimizing recovery and short-term recovery methods. We conclude that well-accepted methods such as sufficient nutrition, hydration, and rest appear to be the most effective strategies for optimizing recovery in Olympic athletes.

AB - Objectives and method: As the field of applied sport psychology (ASP) is witnessing a growth in interest in professional practice, it is also faced with the challenge of developing its professional status. Taking into account the lack of research on the career development of ASP practitioners, this article reviews research and information relevant to two major career phases: a) education in preparing for ASP practice, and b) initiation and development of professional ASP practice. The paper also provides an initial collation of information and research regarding ASP education, professional development, and service provision in Europe. Results and conclusions: Results revealed that the field of ASP still faces the challenge of formulating an encompassing and uniformly used definition of ASP; of gaining a better understanding of the career development of ASP professionals, with particular attention for female ASP practitioners; of gaining insight into, analyzing and providing quality management in the educational pathways preparing for ASP practice; and of optimizing the vocational development of the ASP professional by way of ensuring the quality of ASP service delivery and the development of competencies in ASP practitioners. In conclusion, recommendations are formulated for furthering the development of ASP in Europe, and on the possible role of the European Federation for the Psychology of Sport and Physical Activity (FEPSAC).

AB - Reviews the books, Finding your zone: Ten core lessons for achieving peak performance in sports and life by Michael Lardon (2008) and The beauty prescription: The complete formula for looking and feeling beautiful by Eva Ritvo and Debra Luftman (2008). Dr. Lardon’s book focuses on sport psychiatry. It is a very practical book with concrete examples of how applying skills can improve performance. The beauty prescription includes some elements of sport psychiatry. The text emphasizes the power of positive self-talk, the need to make an honest self-assessment in the Beauty Prescription Quiz, and how to set and maintain goals. The Beauty-Brain Loop can be a parallel to winning body language and improved performance in performance psychology. The ideas of stress management, improving outcomes, and "paying yourself" first in the currency of beauty were interesting, especially when considering how athletes may have changed our society’s view of beauty. The authors also recommend hiring personal trainers for both mental and physical benefits. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Reviews the article, Anticipated affective consequences of physical activity adoption and maintenance by G. F. Dunton and E. Vaughan (see record 2008-16224-005). The authors hypothesized that the anticipated outcomes should become more positive when an individual gets closer to adopting physical activity. The authors also hypothesized that anticipated positive outcomes would be more related to the adoption of physical activity, whereas anticipated negative outcomes would be more related to the maintenance of physical activity. Results showed that positive and negative anticipated outcomes differed by stage of change. Specifically, positive emotions were higher in contemplation versus precontemplation, and negative emotions were higher in maintenance versus action, and preparation compared to maintenance. Finally, both positive and negative emotions were higher in action and maintenance compared to the other three stages. The authors concluded that positive, rather than negative, anticipated emotional outcomes were associated with physical activity adoption and maintenance. Therefore, it is possible that emotion-oriented interventions that focus on positive affective outcomes may be effective for increasing physical activity behavior.

Murphy (see record 2009-02876-001). Mental skills have been shown to be important for successful competitive performance; however, athletes do not practice them systematically. The aim of this study was to examine athletes’ use of observational learning and imagery in both practice and competition. A second aim was to determine how the use of these two skills was related to sport confidence. The authors concluded that practitioners such as coaches and sport psychologists would do well to encourage athletes to utilize observational learning and imagery for building confidence in practice, whereas imagery should be encouraged more for promoting confidence during competition.

AB - The aim of this study was to test the predictions of attentional control theory using the quiet eye period as an objective measure of attentional control. Ten basketball players took free throws in two counterbalanced experimental conditions designed to manipulate the anxiety they experienced. Point of gaze was measured using an ASL Mobile Eye tracker and fixations including the quiet eye were determined using frame-by-frame analysis. The manipulation of anxiety resulted in significant reductions in the duration of the quiet eye period and free throw success rate, thus supporting the predictions of attentional control theory. Anxiety impaired goal-directed attentional control (quiet eye period) at the expense of stimulus-driven control (more fixations of shorter duration to various targets). The findings suggest that attentional control theory may be a useful theoretical framework for examining the relationship between anxiety and performance in visuomotor sport skills.

AB - Special Olympics is the largest competitive sports organisation in the world for athletes with intellectual disabilities. The organisation has attempted to make adjustments to its programmes in order to stay relevant to participants. However, minimal investigation relative to participation patterns and demographics of athletes are available. Given the trend towards inclusive programmes, such analysis appears relevant. The purpose of the present investigation was to examine the population demographics and participation characteristics of Special Olympics participants. Registration information for 284 athletes was analysed with regard to age, sex and sports participated in. Findings indicated that the demographics of this Special Olympics cohort were predominantly male, older in years than other sport organisations and engaged in a small number of sports. Results are discussed in terms of the impact of an ageing athlete population, female participation patterns, health-related physical fitness implications of participation in certain sports and the range of activities offered.

AB - This Editorial provides an overview of the current issue. The first paper comes from James Dimmock and Lauren Banting (both of The University of Western Australia) and evaluates research on the effects of implicit cognitive processes on physical activity. The second paper is by Mark Bruner, Karl Erikson, Kimberley McFadden and Jean Cote (Queen's University, Canada) and presents a novel review of the conceptual origins of a the most prominent models of athlete development in contemporary sport psychology. In the next review, David Shearer (Swansea University), Paul Holmes (Manchester Metropolitan University) and Stephen Mellalieu (Swansea University) provide a critique of the construct of 'collective efficacy' (or a group's shared belief in its conjoint capacity to achieve a given goal) using some principles and findings from the emerging field of social neuroscience. The fourth paper, by Daniel Gucciardi, Sandy Gordon and James Dimmock (The University of Western Australia), reviews research on mental toughness from the theoretical perspective of personal construct psychology. The fifth paper, by Panteleimon Ekkekakis (Iowa State University), reviews the conceptual foundations of, and research on, the 'Dual-Mode' theory of affective responses to physical exercise. Finally, Sam Carr (University of Bath) provides a critical appraisal of research on the conceptual and methodological links between attachment theory and achievement goal and peer-relationship models.

AB - The performance profile technique (Butler, 1989, 1991), which stems from a personal construct psychology (PCP; Kelly, 1955/1991) framework, has become a useful methodology for identifying and understanding an athlete’s perceived need for areas of improvement. Despite the popularity of this technique, current descriptions and practices fail to appreciate key tenets of PCP which offer a greater insight into one’s perspective. Accordingly, the purposes of this paper are to revisit the performance profile technique and describe an extension of its current form by drawing on these key PCP tenets as well as providing an example of the revised methodology in practice. Following a brief overview of PCP, we outline two key tenets of this theoretical framework that have guided the revised version of the performance profile technique presented here. We conclude with a case example of the new methodology in practice using an Australian footballer’s perception of mental toughness.

AB - This report examined the temporal consistency of preshot routines and the temporal similarity and variability between simulated movements before and after a shot. 12 male amateur golfers ages 32 to 69 years ( M = 53.4, SD = 10.5) were assigned into two groups according to their handicaps: skilled ( M = 4.0 handicap, SD = 3.1) and less-skilled ( M = 16.0 handicap, SD = 6.5). They performed their shots mentally from their preshot routines to the points when the balls came to rest, then performed the same shots physically and again recalled the shots mentally. For each of four par-three holes, participants' performances were filmed, and the durations of mental and actual shots were timed. Analysis showed that the skilled golfers had more consistent preshot routines in actual movement, and they also had longer durations for the ball flight phase than the less-skilled golfers in simulated movement. The present findings support the importance of consistent preshot routines for high performance in golf, however, the duration of simulated movements was underestimated both before and after the shots. This also suggests that skilled golfers attend to performance goals both before and after shots to execute their shots under proceduralized control and to correct their movements for their next shot.

AB - As applied sport psychology continues to grow, a variety of professionals may attempt to teach athletes mental skills; however, there is little research to suggest which skills professionals may be qualified to use with their clients. This research examined sport professionals’ use of psychological skills training (PST) and their previous training, self-efficacy, and perceptions of each skill. After a national survey, the final sample included 54 athletic trainers, 64 coaches, and 50 licensed psychologists ( n = 168). Psychologists reported using hypnosis and self-talk more frequently than ATCs and coaches, while coaches reported using team building and time management most often. Participants perceived hypnosis, energy management, imagery, and cognitive restructuring to require the most training out of the nine skills. These results are discussed within the context of developing a hierarchy of psychological skill used to guide professionals in their future work.

AB - This article analyzes studies of the symbolization process in sports activities. Many researchers (B. Britton, J. Van Raalte, L. Hardy, and others) note that athletes in their professional activities face a situation of uncertainty (a situation of deficit of means, of behavior models, etc.). The author shows that the peculiarity of using a symbol, in contrast to the sign, is connected primarily to the emergence of these types of situations. The analysis of experimental data shows that the symbolism in sports realizes two functions: cognitive and emotional. The symbolic image in a situation of uncertainty can document the stress associated with it, due to its transfer to the symbolic plan. Since the symbolic image does not have an unambiguous interpretation, one of its properties is the emotional strain, because of the differences between the real situation and figurative content of the symbol, thus its use can lead to increased motivation of athletes. The application of the symbolic image in the preparation of athletes offers new research directions in the field of sports psychology.

AB - One of the reasons many musicians have found it difficult to perform their best in public is because of a lack of knowledge about mental skills training In the realm of sport psychology, self-talk has been found to be an effective mental skills tool for increasing self confidence, decreasing anxiety-based problems and enhancing performance. The purpose of this study was twofold. The first was to determine the effect of a self-talk intervention on self-confidence, energy management and stress, and performance during college students' adjudicated music performance examinations. The second was to determine the influence of the participants' motivational styles on self-talk intervention effectiveness. Utilizing a pre-test/post-test, quasi-experimental design enhanced by qualitative interviews, an 8-week self-talk intervention was implemented. Results indicated that self-talk intervention participants experienced a significant increase in trait self-confidence and significant reductions in trait and state anxiety compared to musicians in a control group. Partial qualitative support was found for self-talk being useful as a performance enhancement intervention strategy. Motivational styles were found to have a minimal impact on self-talk effectiveness during musical examination performances. Study limitations were discussed and future research directions were offered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Performance maximization is a popular goal of athletes, coaches, and sport psychologists, and the state where peak performance is most likely to occur is often called "the zone" or flow. Interventions based on mindfulness, which promote present-moment awareness and non judgmental acceptance, have recently been shown to be effective for treating various mental and physical health concerns. Mindfulness approaches also appear to be more compatible with theories of flow and peak performance than traditional cognitive and behavioral techniques that emphasize altering maladaptive thoughts. The present study assessed how training in Mindful Sport Performance Enhancement (MSPE), a 4-week mindfulness program developed for this research, affected the performance and performance-related psychological characteristics of 11 archers and 21 golfers from the community. Prior to and after the training, participants completed trait measures of sport anxiety, perfectionism, sport confidence, thought disruption while performing, mindfulness, and flow. During the training, they provided data on their sport performances, as well as their state levels of mindfulness and flow. Analyses revealed that, for both archers and golfers, significant changes in dimensions of the trait variables occurred during the training. Specifically, there were significant increases in the archers' overall mindfulness and optimism as well as the golfers' intrusive thoughts during performance and ability to describe present-moment experiences. Levels of state flow attained by the athletes also increased between the first and final sessions. Due to scoring complications, archers' performance logs could not be analyzed, but no significant changes in performance were evident for golfers. However, post-workshop feedback from the athletes indicated expectations that the training would benefit performance in the future, making follow up necessary. Additionally, at baseline, dispositional flow was inversely related to anxiety, perfectionism, and thought disruption, and positively associated with trait mindfulness and confidence, furthering understanding of the flow construct. Mindful Sport Performance Enhancement may be a promising intervention to use with athletes, particularly if more time is allotted for practice and implementation of the skills taught. Future research should include athletes from other sports and use a larger sample to allow for random assignment to intervention and control groups.

AB - The purpose of the research was to examine the motivations and training habits of first-time and veteran marathon participants affiliated with a charitable cause organization. A significant number of first-time and veteran marathon runners chose to participate in this endurance event in support of a cause. Participants were required to raise money, as well as sacrifice a considerable number of hours to training, enduring physical duress. It was hoped that an understanding of the motivations for participation and training habits would serve to improve recruitment, preparation, and persistence of runners. Results indicated some statistically significant differences in the motivations of first-time participants and veteran marathon runners. The study participants included first-time (n=60) and veteran marathoners (n=55) who participated in the Country Music Marathon, in Nashville, Tennessee. Runners were recruited from among the members of the Leukemia Society's Team in Training. Team in Training is the endurance sport, fundraising organization associated with the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. Volunteer respondents completed three questionnaires including: the Participant Questionnaire, collecting demographic, training, and present or past association with a blood cancer patient information; the Motivations of Marathoners Scales; and the Motivations of Sport Volunteers Scales. Responses were analyzed via a series of parametric and non-parametric statistical tests. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - The purpose of this study was to examine organisational stressors, coping, and perceptions of coping effectiveness with an elite coach. The participant completed a daily diary over a 28-day period. Each diary entry consisted of an open-ended stressor, a coping response section, and a Likert-type scale measure of coping effectiveness. Inductive and deductive content analysis procedures were used to analyse the diaries, in addition to frequency data which were obtained for both stressors and coping strategies. Findings indicated administration, overload, competition environment , the athletes, and team atmosphere were the salient organisational stressors. Coping strategies used to alleviate such stressors were communication, preparation, planning, social support , and self-talk. These strategies were generally effective, but coping effectiveness declined over the 28-days. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - A multiple baseline across groups design was used to examine the effects of an imagery intervention on perceptions of collective efficacy. Members (n = 10) from an international wheelchair basketball team were separated into three regional intervention groups. Each group completed a 4 week, video-aided, motivational general–mastery (MG-M) type imagery program with team content. Collective efficacy was measured via the Collective Efficacy Inventory (Callow, Hardy, Markland, & Shearer, 2004). Collective efficacy increased for the South group and became more consistent for the Midlands group. No changes were reported for the North group. Social validation measures indicated potential mechanisms via imagery effects on individual perceptions of self-efficacy and then collective efficacy. The results provide partial support for the use of MG-M type imagery interventions to enhance both individual and team perceptions of collective efficacy in elite wheelchair basketball.

AB - The objective of this study was to establish the level of control over psychological skills possessed by young table tennis, badminton and football players in different categories of sports for young people and to study its possible association with their experience in sport and competition (years playing and years competing). 12 table tennis players from the beginners category (age: M = 11.09, sd = 1.38), 4 badminton players from the juniors category (age: M = 16.25, sd = 0.5) and 25 football players, 13 from the beginners category (age: M = 11.31, sd = 0.48) and 12 from the juniors category (age: M= 17.00, sd = 0.85), all of whom belong to sports federations, participated in this study. The participants answered the Questionnaire on Psychological Skills and Behaviours in Young Children's Sport Competitions Scale (Godoy-Izquierdo et al., 2006 a, b). Young athletes' level of control over psychological skills is generally deficient, and no significant differences were found between racquet-sport athletes and football players, although significant differences in some psychological skills did exist in the case of lower-ranking categories. No significant differences were found as regards experience with sport and competition. The results indicate the appropriateness of considering psychological training so as to complete players' preparation in order to improve the psychological skills that allow them to adequately tackle the increasing demands of participating in a sport as their level of involvement progresses in both individual and group sports.

AB - Self-regulation is the key to any changes that involve the self, whether people want to follow a diet, control their emotional outbursts, or avoid obsessive thoughts (cf. Baumeister & Alquist, Chapter 2 (see record 2009-01315-002), this volume). Thus, self-regulation involves impulse control, emotion control, thought control, and, finally, performance control. The latter will be the topic of the present chapter. The importance of self-regulation for performance is nowhere as obvious as in athletic performance; athletes need to maintain high levels of self-regulation for preparation as well as for execution of their performance. We want to focus on the aspects of self-regulation that are essential during execution. Aspects of self-regulation that are concerned with preparation, for example, delay of gratification as in denying oneself certain pleasures (greasy food), or ego depletion as in keeping constant control over oneself (regular exercise), are also of great interest. However, we will discuss the regulatory states and motivations that determine ongoing task performance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)

AB - In Switzerland, sport psychology started in the 1960s. A historical retrospective reveals that, unlike Germany, it did not become established at a university level, but rather was incorporated into the training of coaches and into applied work in top-level sports. An important aspect here was the co-operation with Swiss Olympic, the umbrella organisation for sport and integration into its support concepts. In the past 20 years, the organizational and professional orientation of the Swiss Association of Sport Psychology (SASP) has been closely linked with the standards of the Swiss Psychology Federation (FSP). To avoid associations with negative headlines linked to unserious mental gurus, quality management guidelines for sport psychology started to be developed about 10 years ago. A specialist qualification in sport psychology recognized by the FSP and an extra-occupational postgraduate training program, as well as recognition through the world of sport, are making sport psychology an increasingly attractive professional field.

AB - Over the past 25 years the field of sport psychology has developed very successfully in the Netherlands. Until about 1985, sport psychology played a rather marginal role. Since then, however, a remarkable improvement can be observed. Currently, a considerable amount of attention is paid to the structural integration of sport psychology into research and education programs of several universities. Attitudes toward sport psychology and mental training on the whole are very positive. Further, the media and the sports world treat sport psychology with an attitude that is more benevolent than ever. An accreditation system was introduced approximately 3 years ago,which will ensure a baseline level of quality in sport psychology programs. The establishment of a training program for applied sport psychologists in 2007 is a direct consequence of this accreditation system and stresses the progressive professionalization of the field of sport psychology in the Netherlands.

AB - Physical Activity and Health Promotion: Evidence-based Approaches to Practice evaluates the realities and complexities of working to reverse the adverse trend towards physical inactivity. It is a well-rounded, evidence-based analysis of interventions for physical activity practice, covering a range of settings and target groups. Expert contributors present case studies which help to translate the theory into practice, from individual to societal levels, enriched by explanations of the socio-political context. The first section covers the concepts for the development of physical activity practice; influencing sustained health behaviour change, explaining the role and function of health policy in physical activity promotion, and developing the evidence base for physical activity interventions. Section Two explores the evidence base for interventions in physical activity practice, in varied settings and target groups. Physical Activity and Health Promotion concludes with a challenge to innovate in promoting physical activity. Physical Activity and Health Promotion will be relevant to health professionals and students with an interest in sport, physical activity and exercise, particularly health and exercise promotion specialists across the disciplines.

AB - Although sport psychology did not fully mature as a recognized discipline until the 1960's, pioneering psychologists in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, making greater use of empirical research methodologies, sought to understand mental factors that affect athletic performance. Though the psychologists behind the studies described here worked independently of one another and charted their own distinct courses of inquiry, their works, taken together, provided the corpus of precedents and foundations on which the modern field of sport psychology was built. The essays collected in this volume tell the stories not only of these psychologists and their subjects but of the social and academic context that surrounded them, shaping and being shaped by their ideas.

AB - Physical activity and sport are important in the lives of youth and adults with disabilities. Today, many opportunities exist—in schools, community centres and clubs, at local, national and international levels. Youth participation in disability sport and preparation for international competitions are among the priorities of the major disability sport organizations. Many of these disability sport organizations sponsor developmental programmes for youth, training and coaching opportunities and of course, local, regional and national competitions. Physical activity and sport have changed over time, most notably in the late twentieth century providing for the disability sport as we know it in the twenty-first century. The perspective of sport as rehabilitation has given way to sport as sport. Sport, including disability sport, will continue to evolve and become more inclusive. Sport will provide the opportunity for many to explore physical abilities. Empowerment through sport can become a reality especially for those once excluded. Healthful living, physical fitness and competitive sport programmes can now be accessed by those individuals with disabilities of all ages who are interested and willing to participate thanks to those whose efforts created a change. Society in the twenty-first century provides numerous opportunities not enjoyed by the previous generations. It is the responsibility of professionals to share the benefits and pleasures of being physically active with the youth with disabilities of today and for those of tomorrow.

AB - Professional boxing represents a challenging environment in which to work. The work described in this chapter involves a professional boxer's preparation for a World Championship contest. Performance profiling was used to identify constructs associated with performance. The boxer, coach and sport psychologist viewed videotaped sessions with goal setting stemming from differences between observed and ideal states, and imagery being used to enact this performance symbolically. Coach-boxer communication was developed, which led to a range of benefits such as improved between-round feedback and more specific fight plans. Pre-contest performance profiling data indicated meaningful improvements in constructs identified by the boxer. Credibility amongst the support team was a constant challenge due to the performance environment and influences that exist within professional boxing.

AB - (This chapter is based on an earlier publication, A. H. Fuchs, "Psychology and the Babe," Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences 34 [1998]: 153-65) (See record 1998-02213-003). No athlete may be better known in North America than George Herman "Babe" Ruth. In 1921 the Babe would meet up with psychology in the laboratory at Columbia University. Alfred Fuchs tells this story of how Babe Ruth was put through a series of psychological tests aimed at identifying the secrets of his remarkable ability. The idea for the testing came from Hugh Fullerton, a baseball writer who arranged for the assessment at Columbia. The studies were actually conducted by two psychology graduate students. According to Fuchs, Fullerton had two goals for testing Ruth: first, to determine the factors that were responsible for Ruth's ability to hit home runs that traveled such formidable distances and, second, to provide baseball scouts with measurement standards they could use in searching for other ballplayers with Ruthian skills. Fuchs covers the testing in considerable detail, describing the mental, sensory, and motor testing that were common to the psychology laboratories of the time, especially at Columbia, a department founded by James McKeen Cattell, who coined the term mental test and pioneered the development of psychological tests in America. Fuchs closes his chapter with an epilogue describing an almost identical testing in 2006 of St. Louis Cardinals' superstar Albert Pujols in the psychology laboratories at Washington University.

AB - Representing one's country at a Paralympic/Olympic Games is an ambition for many people involved in performance sport: athletes, coaches, support staff, sport medics and sport scientists. The reality is that a relatively small number of people actually realize this ambition. To illustrate this. Great Britain had six official psychologists supporting the 2004 Athens Paralympic and Olympic Games. This chapter describes the author's work as Head Quarters (HQ) psychologist to Paralympics GB. The HQ psychology role for the Athens 2004 Paralympic Games incorporated the provision of psychology support at the pre-Games Holding Camp sites and the Games itself. The role was multi-faceted with planning, preparation and organizational demands prior to the Games and a maintenance role related to these tasks during the pre-Games Holding Camp and the Games. It also emphasized the need to offer psychology support to any member of the GB delegation/team. The range of issues supported was wide, from organizational issues to supporting individual athletes' performances. Finally, the HQ psychology role was influenced by a series of wider organizational factors associated with accreditation, access to athletes and geographical logistics.

AB - Recently there have been suggestions from within sports psychology (e.g., Meyer & Fletcher, 2007) that there are similarities in the use of psychological tools and programs in the corporate and sporting worlds. Therefore it is somewhat surprising that despite the growing body of research supporting emotional intelligence (EI) as an important tool for identifying superior performance levels within the workplace, it is yet to be the subject of rigorous research within other performance arenas such as the sporting environment. The aim of this chapter is to explore the potential relationship between EI and sport basis of their type of sport. The chapter starts with a discussion of earlier conceptions of emotions in sport, progresses to discuss the construct of EI and then provides some empirical data assessing the utility of at least one application of EI to the elite sporting arena. Throughout the chapter we propose theoretical linkages between EI and elite sporting variables that should be the focus of future empirical research.

AB - This chapter is designed to show how an employee assistance program (EAP) can be effective throughout the system of a professional sports organization. The example used is the minor league system of a professional baseball club. The program has been in operation about four years. The baseball organization used as a model has teams of various levels located in seven different locations and comprises approximately two hundred players, managers, coaches, and trainers. The chapter's intent is to explain how and why the EAP was begun, to trace the development over four years, to describe the kinds of issues brought to the EAP for assessment, counseling, and follow-up and to discuss its evolution or utilization rate. In the comment/update section of this chapter, Tamsyn Basson states that the introduction and development of sport-specific EAPs are bringing about a refreshingly new dimension in the way that sport cares for its most important asset—the athlete. By addressing the emotional needs of the athlete in tandem with his or her physical needs, performance levels are enhanced, the quality of life of the athlete and his or her physical family is improved, and playing careers are likely to be extended.

Researchers who enjoy exercise tend to adopt a set to prove rather than disprove their study hypotheses which leads to inaccurate studies. Provided is evidence of studies that are examples of this practice. Positively mentioned is an article in this issue by Eco de Geus and Marleen de Moor (see record 2010-05546-003) that discusses two of the most common delusions in exercise science research: the positive association between exercise and various components of mental health that reflects causal effects of exercise and the idea that exercise exerts beneficial effects of more-or-less equal magnitude on all participants. Other aspects of exercise studies that are discussed include the following: individual differences such as genetics, an exerciser's attitude about exercise, exercise adaptability, an exerciser's neurotransmitter systems, and exercise tolerance.

AB - We examined the effects of instructional and motivational self-talk on centre of mass displacement and hip kinematics during the vertical jump. Twenty-four male rugby union players (age 21.1 years, s = 3.5; body mass 81.0 kg, s = 8.9; height 1.80 m, s = 0.06) performed three vertical jump tests, with a 2 min rest between jumps. Before each jump, participants engaged in one of three counterbalanced interventions (motivational self-talk, instructional self-talk or no-intervention). Motivational self-talk led to greater centre of mass displacement (0.602 m, s = 0.076; P = 0.012) than the no-intervention control (0.583 m, s = 0.085). Centre of mass displacement did not differ between instructional self-talk and the control condition or between motivational and instructional self-talk. Motivational (100.75°, s = 16.05; P = 0.001) and instructional self-talk (106.14°, s = 17.04; P = 0.001) led to greater hip displacement than the no-intervention control (94.11°, s = 17.14). There was also a significant difference in hip displacement between motivational and instructional self-talk ( P = 0.014), although there was no difference between instructional self-talk and the control condition. Motivational (451.69 °/s, s = 74.34; P = 0.008) and instructional self-talk (462.01 °/s, s = 74.37; P = 0.001) led to greater hip rotation velocity than the no-intervention control (434.37 °/s, s = 75.37), although there was no difference between the two self-talk interventions. These results indicate that self-talk may influence performance and technique during the vertical jump in male rugby players.

AB - This study highlights the important role of the self-conscious emotion, pride, as a possible explanatory factor in the perseverance of goal-attainment. This motivational hypothesis of pride was tested in two experimental studies with undergraduate students by measuring perseverance on an effortful mental rotation task and differentiating its effects from self-esteem, self-efficacy, and general positive affect. Intensity of pride mediated the relationship between positive affect and perseverance. These studies direct attention to the distinguishable features of pride, self-efficacy, self-esteem, and positive affect in the association with goal-directed efforts and propose implications for theory and practice. The strong effects of pride as a motivational mechanism suggest it is an emotion worthy of future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

On the whole a psychoanalytic application to sporting success is minimal. Athletic success at the highest level requires suffering beyond the ordinary limits we would expect individuals to endure. In my experience psychoanalysis de-contextualises suffering in sport so that it is seen as a form of self-harm. This position limits the scope of psychoanalytic understanding to support professional athletes in maximising their athletic potential. This article is especially interested in how group analytic theory can be applied to create a winning identity. The theatre of operation in which this identity formation will be tested is the Tour de France (bicycle race). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - The authors of this article served as sport psychology consultants for the 2000 USA Olympic track and field team that competed in Sydney, Australia. In this capacity they provided sport psychology services for the staff (coaches and managers) and athletes of the team not only during the Olympics but throughout the quadrennium (1997-2000) that preceded the Games. This article provides both an overview and the practical applications of various aspects of the service delivery framework that was utilized during this period, including research foundations; coping with physical bankruptcy, illness, and injury; drug testing; staff stress and strain; and mental skills training/interventions for elite track and field athletes. The article is presented in a case report format that illustrates the application of sport psychology strategies, techniques, and services to a variety of performance issues and circumstances that emerged during the track and field competition of the 2000 Olympic Games.

AB - For the great majority of sports, the performance of an athlete at the Olympic Games is considered an ultimate moment of the athletic career. Making the team or winning an Olympic medal can change an athlete's entire future. At the Olympic Games, everything is a performance issue. The pressure and reality of the outcome also changes the work of the sport psychologist. This article describes the types of issues that arise at the games and how the sport psychologist can handle them. The issues faced by the United States athletes include clinical issues, adjustment to external factors, interpersonal conflicts, distraction at the Games, and performance pressure. These issues emphasize the important role of the sport psychologist as a key resource to make an impact on performance. The article then describes the challenges and services of the Sport Psychology Department of the United States Olympic Committee (USOC). Multiple-sport programs and products were written and produced in order to deliver mental training manuals and educate players across sports. Individual Team Service Programs were designed to be in place in the years before the Olympic Games. The article concludes that the sport psychologist must be ready for everything, and success is helping athletes and coaches prevent the problems from becoming critical. After the games, the effectiveness of the services has been consistently rated by athletes and coaches as having a major positive impact on individual and team performances at the Games.

AB - The purpose of this article is to examine the psychological preparation provided to athletes during their stay in the Olympic Village at the Olympic Games. A four-phase approach of psychological preparation is presented—the habituation phase, the psychological routine phase, the specific psychological preparation phase, and the psychological recovery phase. The conceptual roots of this approach, as a part of the four-year psychological preparation for the Olympics, are discussed. The objectives, psychological programs, and framework of consultations for each phase are described, using examples from two summer Olympic Games, Sydney 2000 and Athens 2004. Lessons learned from the psychological preparation provided at the Olympic Village and practical recommendations for sport psychology consultants are offered.

AB - Norway has strong traditions when it comes to doing well in Winter Olympics. In 2002 in Salt Lake City, Norway became the best nation (i.e., most gold medals and overall points), and thus the expectations leading up to the 2006 Turin Games in Italy were high. The goal was 25 medals, although it ended up with 19. This was regarded as rather poor results among the Norwegian sports journalists. The evaluation following the Games revealed that illness and lack of mental preparations were two of the key factors to which the athletes attributed the disappointing results. To illustrate the dynamics during the Games and how the expectations and the mixed results influenced one of the athletes and also the work of the sport psychologist, a case is presented. The role of a nation's collective efficacy and how it may influence the athletes is discussed, as well as the role of the coach as an important mediator regarding how an athlete may or may not cope during such circumstances.

AB - Taiwan organized a sport science team that included a sport psychology team for its archery team in preparation for the 2004 Athens Olympic Games. For approximately one and a half years prior to the 2004 Olympic Games, the sports psychology team cooperated with the coaches. Within this time period, the Taiwan archers achieved significant improvement in performance. This accomplishment was particularly impressive considering both the inexperience of the team and its modest level of performance in the past. This report intends to provide a personal account of how sport psychology was applied to enhance the archers' performance. Specifically, given a background of general rejection to sport scientists' involvement in the sport training by the coaches, this paper will report how these obstacles were overcome and what experiences were gained that may be useful for other countries organizing and trying to integrate a sport psychology team in cooperation with sport teams.

AB - The purpose of this article was to evaluate the psychological intervention effectiveness of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) and mental skills training in changing a Hong Kong athlete's (L) low frustration tolerance (LFT) during competitions. Self-evaluation and the coach's evaluation by the Goal Attainment Scale (GAS), verbal feedback of L, his coach, and partner, and videotape analysis were used for the evaluation at different points in time. Results were consistent and positive in attesting to the effectiveness of psychological intervention in changing L's LFT behaviors. The resolution of the problem also facilitated the performance enhancement of L in competitions. L and his partner won the silver medal in table tennis, in the doubles category, at the 2004 Olympic Games. The active support of the coach and the presence of the first author at the site of major competitions also played a crucial role in maintaining L's motivation to achieve lasting changes.

AB - Little attention has been given to how endurance sport athletes cope with periods of extreme physical duress. This study explored behavioral and psychological characteristics and coping responses associated with "hitting the Wall " (HTW) using inductive grounded theory analytic procedures (Charmaz, 2000). Marathon runners (N = 57; M age = 41.79 yrs) were recruited from two online marathon listserves with members who are experienced, recreational marathon runners. Characteristics and coping responses of HTW included many physiological and psychological descriptors that led to race-related physical coping efforts (e.g., supplementation/hydration), emotion-focused coping (e.g., social support), and cognitive strategies (e.g., willpower, mental reframing). Extreme physical duress during endurance sport performance may provide an ideal context in which to study coping responses to physiological stress. Findings point toward the need to develop effective interventions that rely on multiple coping strategies in response to extreme physical challenges.

AB - I have always been fascinated with groups. I cannot remember when I was not intrigued by their potential for sustenance and nurture but also for their destructive capacities, small and large. As a child growing up in the suburban Midwest, I experienced the joy and excitement of best friends and the sheer physical exhilaration and camaraderie of playing team sports. My first group was my Family. Second group was, My Chosen Family and Linda's Dying. Third group, Graduate School at Goddard: Group Gone Bad. Forth group was, The Albuquerque Rape Crisis Center: More Lessons About Leadership. Fifth group was, The Consciousness-Raising Group and the last was, Consultation Group. In this article, I have categorized the groups as my families, lessons for the therapist, and groups that changed my life to create some semblance of order. But the distinctions are neither accurate, nor do they truly express the complexity of their impact on my life. In reality, all of the groups have become their own families, they have in turn sweetly swept me along in my path as a clinician or sharply challenged assumptions about my work, and they have changed my life in sometimes unsettling and wondrous ways.

AB - This study examined whether the negative correlation between exercise and depression also exists for other types of physical activity, such as occupational and household physical activity. Participants numbered 528 (285 men, 243 women) between the ages of 20 and 70 years were included in the study. Data on leisure, occupational, and household physical activity were collected over the course of one year using 24-hr telephone recalls, as well as data on depression as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck & Steer, 1987). Leisure-time physical activity was predictive of lower depression scores in women, whereas occupational and household physical activity was not predictive of depression scores for either men or women. In women, high intensity leisure-time physical activity was more predictive of depression scores than was low intensity leisure-time physical activity. Mental health effects of exercise may be specific to the characteristics of the exercise activity itself, rather than mere physiological activation. Implications for future research are discussed.

AB - Objectives: This study examined differences in motives for and in barriers to physical activity participation in middle-aged Chinese women between activity levels and motivational styles. Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: Chinese middle-aged women (N=360) completed a battery of questionnaires about level of physical activity, reasons for and barriers to physical activity participation, and general motivational style. Results: Eighty percent of the women were classified into precontemplation, contemplation, or preparation stages of physical activity, indicating the majority were not physically active enough to achieve health benefits. Fitness-health, enjoyment-interest and appearance were found to be the most important motives for, and lack of time, resources or skills and family or friend support the most important barriers to participation. Women in the later stages of physical activity behavior were more likely to exhibit greater motive strengths and to perceive fewer barriers compared to those in the earlier stages. Among a number of motivational style results, women in the later stages were found to be more arousal-seeking and to rate challenge of activities and improving competence higher than women in the earlier stages. Also, having a mastery motivational style and a higher income were strong predictors of physical activity participation in these middle-aged women. Conclusion: The findings of the present study extend the literature by providing insights into how women's motives for and barriers to physical activity participation are related to their activity levels and motivational styles. The implications of the results for physical activity promotion and provision with regard to benefiting women's health are discussed.

AB - The continuity hypothesis in its general form states that dreams reflect waking life: concerns, thoughts, and experiences (G. W. Domhoff, 1996; M. Schredl, 1999; I. Strauch & B. Meier, 1996). For example, athletes and sport students dream about sports more often than do psychology students, presumably reflecting their engagement in sport activities and sport theory (D. Erlacher & M. Schredl, 2004). In the present study, the authors tested the previously unexamined hypothesis that differences in dream content would directly reflect individuals' differing amounts of waking sport activities. As expected, the amount of time that individuals spent engaged in an activity (sports or reading) was directly related to their percentage of corresponding dreams. Also, individuals reported reading dreams less frequently than they did sport dreams, although reading was more prominent in their waking lives than were sport activities. The findings also indicated that other factors such as emotional involvement and associated worries might be of importance in explaining the relation between waking activities and dream events. Future studies using longitudinal designs would shed more light on this relation and would help derive a more precise formulation of the continuity hypothesis.

AB - Previous research on athlete retirement in China has often focused on non-psychological factors and treated athlete retirement as an incident. Based on the theoretical process of athlete retirement, this study is designed to explore retirement awareness, for which athletes are divided into different groups based on the duration of their involvement with athletics, and also to examine the psychological state of athletes and retired athletes. Our survey on retirement awareness covered 789 athletes (540 athletes and 249 retired athletes); it included questions pertaining to athlete identity and preparation for retirement and a questionnaire on their psychological states, including their satisfaction with life, the appraisal of personal relationships, self-evaluation, social support, the anxiety of life, and loneliness. Quantitative analyses were conducted on these variables using a MANOVA. The results of the MANOVA showed that retired athletes reported a lower level of life anxiety and more loneliness than non-retired athletes; athletes who had been retired for one-year reported less social support as compared with other retired athletes. Further, athletes who had intentions to retire reported higher negative psychological state than those who did not intend to retire. The results also showed that there was a significant difference in retirement awareness among the sport performance groups (F(6, 1464) = 4.86, p < 0. 05, Wiks' Lambda = 0.96, ES = 0.02). The Post-Hoc Test revealed that the athletes who won the medals at international competitions were most likely to be aware of the retirement than others. Finally, the MANOVA showed that there was no difference in the psychological state as a function of athlete's performance. The findings of this study provide quantitative psychological data pertaining to athlete retirement in China and suggest that retirement counseling and social support are useful to athletes when they intend to retire.

High school students (n = 30) who were engaged in several extracurricular sports activities had instructions on group AT once a week for five sessions. Every participant could acquire approximately one minute practice of the second formula of the standard exercises. The effect of AT were evaluated by using the Diagnostic Inventory of Psychological Competitive Ability for Athletes and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. In Study 2, a specific group among those who practiced AT in the first study had additional AT instructions and their mental changes were investigated over seven months. The results suggested that instruction in AT before a game was effective for alleviating stress. Some problems such as those related to self sustaining AT were also identified.

AB - Preparatory heart rate deceleration occurs in tasks with an external focus of attention and is often assumed to facilitate balance performance. However, its effects upon sport-related complex balance movements have not been studied. Heart rate patterns during the preparation period of an acrobatic element (flic-flac) on the balance beam were studied in 14 female gymnasts (M age 13.2 years). A significant heart rate deceleration was found in attempts with a fall in the consecutive acrobatic element, but not in attempts without a fall. These data suggest that preparatory heart rate deceleration may be detrimental to the performance of complex movements on the balance beam.

AB - This study investigates the discursive management of taking prohibited substances in sport. In particular, it explores how one high-profile athlete, Australian cricketer Shane Warne, accounted for his drug-taking behavior when talking to the media. Discursive psychology (DP) is used as the theoretical and methodological framework to study drug discourses in sport. Emphasis in DP is on making explicit how psychological concepts (e.g., drug explanations) are used in everyday talk to perform certain actions. The research data is Warne's first public press statement concerning his 2003 positive test for hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride. Analysis reveals that Warne constructed his drug taking as not being related to performance enhancement and substantiated this with a history of negative test results. Warne worked up his taking as the result of ignorance rather than deliberate deception. Further, he presented this as a one-off event and not reflective of systematic drug usage. It is argued in this study that to better understand drug taking in sport, sport researchers need to understand how athletes talk about drugs. For it is through talk that most sporting activities are conducted and maintained, and it is this talk that needs to be understood and analyzed.

AB - There has been a substantial increase in the application of sport psychology theory and practice in business settings in recent years. This paper outlines points of intersection and divergence between sport and business, and provides examples from sport that are of-use in business settings. This paper also draws upon Orlick's 2008 evidence-based model of excellence, as a vehicle for illustrating key skills associated with peak performance across a variety of high-stress domains including sport, music, and medicine. We posit that this model can be applied to improving performance in the corporate world. The 'Wheel of Excellence' model incorporates seven key elements, with Focus as the hub, in addition to Commitment, Mental Readiness, Positive Images, Confidence, Distraction Control, and Ongoing Learning. Given the close parallels between business and sport psychology, it is anticipated that increasing attention will be devoted to their integration and application crossover in the future.

In successfully changing his problem, his performance was also expected to improve. Multiple methods were utilized for the evaluation at different points in time. These included (1) self-evaluation and the coach's evaluation by the Goal Attainment Scale (GAS);(2) verbal feedback of L, L's coach, and L's partner; and (3) videotape analysis. The results were consistent and positive in attesting to the effectiveness of psychological intervention in changing L's LFT behaviors. Using REBT in this study, the sport-related irrational beliefs and behaviors of L were identified. This was crucial for changing the low frustration tolerance of L. The processes of disputing and restructuring L's irrational beliefs were gradual, with fluctuations at times during parts of the action/maintenance stage. Overall, however, the changes had been positive and had been carried out in the right direction. It was interesting to note that in comparison with the other irrational beliefs, his beliefs about technique training were corrected at a slightly slower pace. However, once the former was resolved, the change process was able to move faster. Further, the resolution of his main problem facilitated the enhancement of his performance at the 2004 Olympic Games. According to L and his coach, the double's achievement was partly attributed to the psychological intervention that was introduced about 10 months prior to the tournament. The coach believed that "psychological intervention was directly related to the success at the Olympic Games"; however, L remarked "psychological training has enabled me to gain full control of my emotions and play out to my potentials." In this study, psychological intervention was found to be an ongoing, multisituational process. Apart from regular consultation with L at the local training center, the first author's presence at the overseas training camps and competitions was a facilitating factor. His presence in these various situations provided an immediate on-the-spot opportunity for educating and changing L's problematic behaviors with the support of his coach and partner. The role of the coach was an interesting case in point. It is to note that although the coach could help L cope with his stress, if not handled well, the coach could become a source of stress for the athlete. Thus, during the implementation of the intervention, the coach's sensitivity, understanding, and support were essential in contributing to the ultimate success of the intervention. In fact, the coach played an important role in this case in that he actively participated in the discussions, disputed L's irrational beliefs, and guided L during the competition as well as provided the first author with time, opportunity, and resources to conduct his work.

AB - The purpose of this research was to investigate the effects of heart rhythm variability (HRV) biofeedback training with emotional regulation on the athletic performance of women collegiate volleyball players. The participant's ability to self-regulate and her perception of the intervention were also examined. Individual biofeedback training using the emWavereg; PC (1.0) was provided to 13 student-athletes during six weekly sessions. A portable biofeedback device known as the emWavereg; PSR was available for independent self-regulation rehearsal. The research was a quasi-experimental, repeated-measure, mixed-methodology, within-subject design. The quantitative results supported the hypothesis that the team and its 13 participants self-regulated at will. The results did not support the hypothesis that the intervention improved performance. One possibility for this finding was the presence of a statistical and performance ceiling effect. The qualitative results revealed a positive perception of the intervention relating to the participants' roles as students, athletes, and team members. Numerous themes emerged from the interviews reflecting the benefits of the intervention. (a) Learning about biofeedback and self-regulation while visualizing the heart rhythm on the computer screen. (b) Improving self-awareness and increasing self-control. (c) Reducing the effects of physical and mental stress relating to academic and athletic rigors. (d) Experiencing enhanced physical and mental states improving academic and athletic performance. (e) Improving team composure and camaraderie. Although further research is warranted, the results of this innovative intervention demonstrate the potential to enhance academic and athletic performance in collegiate sport.

AB - The purpose of this case study was to discover to what extent, if any, Coach John Wooden's leadership style demonstrates servant leadership. Hammermeister, Baldwin, Chase, and Westre (2007) state that many authors are calling for new models of leadership in sports settings and conclude that athletes being coached by a servant-leader had an increase in motivation, had higher mental acuity, and were more satisfied with their sports experience. Similar to coaches, leaders of business and nonprofit organizations are searching for new skills and better ways to lead. Spears (1998) indicates that there is a shift in this new century from a traditional autocratic and hierarchical style of leadership to more of a leadership style that promotes teamwork and community; includes others in decision making; and has clear ethical and caring characteristics with a goal of improving the personal growth of workers. This study utilized a qualitative methodology to examine and decode the historical data concerning John Wooden's leadership style to determine whether his style is consistent with the 10 servant leadership characteristics for this study, which are based upon the 10 tenets of servant leadership, as framed and defined by Robert Greenleaf (1977). The study involved an exhaustive search of both primary sources written by John Wooden and secondary sources written about him. These sources were color coded, segregated, and analyzed into the 10 characteristics of servant leadership themes to document the leadership style of John Wooden. Based upon the analysis of numerous primary and secondary leadership literature sources, with a focus on the richness and quality of the information in addressing each research question, the evidence demonstrated that John Wooden's leadership style is consistent with 9 of 10 (90%) characteristics of servant leadership that were defined for this study. There was a limitation in available literature to demonstrate conclusively that John Wooden's leadership style is consistent with 1 of the 10 characteristics, healing. Most notably, the findings showed that John Wooden has a strong affinity towards the growth of people, which is also one of the servant leadership characteristics defined for this study.

AB - Using the theoretical framework of Self-Determination Theory (Deci, 1975; Deci, & Ryan, 1985, 2000; Ryan, & Deci, 2002) and Cognitive Evaluation Theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985, 1991, 2000) it was hypothesized that a specific coach behavior, the provision of training plans in advance to athletes, could positively impact athlete intrinsic and self-determined motivation as well as other positive athlete attributes such as sport satisfaction, goal setting, vitality, and better preparation and planning for training. A mixed methodology approach was employed as both qualitative and quantitative data were obtained. The qualitative component involved the use of structured interviewing to understand better how individual sport athletes (N = 13) perceive their coaches in relation to their communication of training plans. For the quantitative components, a daily diary methodology was used with the goal of investigating how track athletes (N = 11) working with the same coach would perceive either receiving no training plan information over time as well as receiving detailed training plan information over two-week periods. Finally a correlational study (N = 130) using athletes from fourteen sports was undertaken to more clearly determine the links between coach communication of training plans, athlete perceptions of coach behavior, athlete self-determined motivation, and goal orientation. The qualitative component of the study revealed that athletes current motivation, the coaching tradition in a sport, and the development stage of an athlete's career all play a large role in the communication of training plans between a coach and athlete. The analyses of the daily diary study suggested some positive consequences may be associated with advance communication of training plans such as better athlete preparation and planning for training as well higher moods and motivation at practice. Regression results from the correlational study provide some clear links between advance communication of training plans, coach clarity of communication, and coach interpersonal behaviors related to athlete needs for relatedness, competence, and autonomy. In turn coach interpersonal behaviors are highly related to athlete self-determination and other positive consequences such as a mastery goal-orientation and high vitality and sport satisfaction. These finding are discussed in terms of how they relate to self-determination theory, and more specifically Deci and Ryan's cognitive evaluation theory (1980, 2000). Practical implications for coaching are also discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - The study aims to investigate the recreation participation behavior of adolescents in Hsinchu City and their satisfaction for recreation participation. In this study, three questionnaires were used: (1) Survey of Demographic Background, (2) Recreational activities participation scale and (3) Leisure satisfaction scale. A total of 720 questionnaires were sent out to 12 senior and vocational high schools during study. A total of 711 were returned after investigation with a return rate of 98.7%; meanwhile, 4 invalid questionnaires were rejected, so 707 were considered valid. The subjects of study were adolescents of 12 senior and vocational high schools in Hsinchu City, Taiwan. Subjects were selected using a Stratified Random Sampling. The researcher selected one teacher from each of the 12 schools to distribute the survey. They randomly draw 20 names from the 1st year students, 20 from the 2nd year students and 20 from the 3rd year students during physical education classes from 4th to 25th June 2008. The study utilized the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences Program (SPSS) Version 16.0 for Windows for statistical analysis. The statistical analysis methods applied to this study included the following: Descriptive Statistics, MANOVA, and Chi-square test. The following conclusions were drawn from the sixteen research questions of three aspects in this study: (1) Regarding the difference of recreation participation satisfaction among adolescents with diversified demographic backgrounds as the variable: the results of this study indicates that males are often encouraged to participate in competitive activities, and females are encouraged to participate in the static activities. The expectation and belief of the traditional role easily affects male and female participation satisfaction. (2) Regarding the difference of adolescents' satisfaction with recreation participation in terms of diversified recreation participation behavior of adolescents: the results of this study shows that the more times and longer (more than 30 minutes) the adolescents participate in recreation, the higher participation satisfaction is. Wang Yu-Qi, Zhang Shao-hee, and Zhang Liang-han (2007) mentioned that the positive effect of recreational activity helps adolescents develop a healthy personality. Good recreational activity helps adolescents to have healthier physical and mental status, to cope with the challenge that adolescents face. If adolescents develop correct recreational activity based on personal hobby or interacts with classmates or friends in order to enhance friendships, this would be a positive recreation participation behavior, and relatively, participation satisfaction would be higher. (3) Regarding the relations between variables of different demographic backgrounds and recreation participation behavior of adolescents: the result of this study indicated that the students of this age are in the learning stage, so the recreation participation venues is mostly located in schools, and companions are mostly their peers of the same age. Further, they don't spend little money on recreation participation, and the participation behavior easily changes. As a result, different demographic backgrounds relate to recreation participation behavior. Finally, based on these conclusions, suggestions by which to enhance the knowledge and techniques to further encourage adolescents' satisfaction were discussed. The study's results do not apply to adolescents in other cities. Only by expanding the scope of the subject group, future researchers can further determine adolescent recreation participation and impeding factors.

AB - Children and youth with disabilities, especially those with mental, emotional, and learning disabilities often demonstrate deficits in social competence (Cartledge & Milburn, 1978; Gresham, Sungai, & Horner, 2001). Lack of appropriate social skills in physical education and sport by children with disabilities can lead to the lack of interaction and finally rejection by classmates without disabilities (Butler & Hodge 2004; Moore, Cartledge, & Heckman, 1995; Place & Hodge, 2001; Sherrill 2003). Further, lack of discipline and control have been cited as major obstacles for effective instruction in physical education (Lavay, French, & Henderson, 2006). Many educators assume that students develop appropriate social skills as a by product of participation in physical education and sports (Buchanan, 2001; Hellison, 2003; Bloom & Smith, 1996). However, it has been demonstrated that appropriate social behaviors improve only when interventions are implemented in physical activity settings (Vidoni, 2005, Balderson & Sharpe, 2005; Moore et al., 1995). Social learning theory (Bandura, 1977) asserts that most behaviors are learned and thus, direct instruction can be employed to teach prosocial behaviors. Within the school environment, physical education is one setting which has been used to improve of social competence (Giebink & McKenzie, 1985; Hellison, 2003; Patrick, Ward, & Crouch, 1998; Siedentop & Tannehill, 2000). However, little has been done to enhance the social skills of children with disabilities (especially those with emotional or behavioral disorders) in physical education and sport settings. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of social skill instruction on the acquisition, maintenance, and generalization of peer related social behaviors of students with emotional or behavioral disorders (EBD) during competitive sports/games activities. The experiment specifically addressed the effect of social skill instruction on the number of appropriate and inappropriate sport/games behaviors during physical education class. Six students (4 males and 2 females) ages 10 through 17 and attending two alternative education school programs designed to serve children and youth with EBD participated in this study. A multiple baseline across participants design was used. A validated Appropriate Sport and Games Behaviors Curriculum (appropriate winning behaviors, appropriate losing behaviors, and appropriate behaviors during the game) was used for this study. Results of this study demonstrated that social skill instruction was an effective strategy to develop appropriate sport and game behaviors and decrease inappropriate ones for students with EBD in physical education. However, there was limited support for generalization. Social validity results demonstrated that parents and teachers support the curriculum as implemented to develop appropriate sport and game behaviors. Although further investigation is needed, the intervention was effective in improving appropriate behaviors and decreasing inappropriate ones.

AB - This dissertation explored the process of designing and implementing a sport psychology program in a public high school setting. A case study method was utilized, in conjunction with Maher's Program Planning and Evaluation approach, to understand how to design and implement three distinct sport psychology programs for three all male high school athletic teams-football, basketball, and baseball-over the course of the 2005-2006 academic year. Theoretical and empirical literatures in sport psychology, school psychology, and gender were considered as important aspects underlying the investigation. A rationale was provided endorsing benefits to student-athletes at the secondary level from receiving sport psychology programming. The author applied the program planning and evaluation approach, which consists of four phases-clarification, design, implementation, and evaluation-to her work with the three teams. The process and products of engaging in these phases are described with respect to curricular content of the three sport psychology programs, along with descriptions of the other consultative services that were offered. Moreover, formative program evaluation information is presented, including player and coach reactions to the three programs. In this regard, student-athletes and coaches from the three programs endorsed the program and reported gaining benefits from their participation. In addition, sport psychology was seen as being a valuable addition to the overall educational program in public schools. The author also explored the possible effects that her gender may have had, both positive and negative, on her work, as well as five variables related to her approach that she believed facilitated her work with the teams and the success of the program. A comparison was made with the previous work done by Weissman (2003) in designing and implementing sport psychology programming in a public high school. In addition, recommendations were offered for individuals wishing to design and implement sport psychology programming in the school setting, as well as for individuals wishing to obtain sport psychology programming for their student-athletes.

AB - A void in research for predicting elite level athletic performance exists. This research seeks to determine if psychological and other attributes correlate significantly to NCAA Division I men's ice hockey performance. Bivariate correlation and multiple variable regression techniques are used on an entire sample of 51 forwards and 25 defensemen, and on these position subgroups. Five NCAA Division I men's ice hockey teams participated in this study (four Central Collegiate Hockey Association teams, one Western Collegiate Hockey Association team). .05 and .1 significance levels are used. Predictor attribute inventories administered include: 'Player's Data Sheet' (Hamre, 2002), 'Test of Attention and Interpersonal Style' (Nideffer, 1976), 'Sources of Enjoyment from Athletic Participation/Motivation' (Bray, 1986), 'Modified Classroom Life Measure' (Johnson, Johnson, and Krotee, 1986, 2002). Performance criteria included playing statistics (goals, assists, points, penalty minutes (PIM), games played, plus/minus rating) and coach evaluation. Several performance criteria were also utilized as predictors. Data were collected from the 2001-02 season. Numerous significant correlations between predictor attributes and performance criteria were identified. Multiple-variable regressions reduced variability from that found in bivariate correlations. Position specific multiple-variable regressions further reduced variability. We conclude that predictor attributes from 'past offensive and playing statistics' (i.e. goals, assists, points, PIM), 'coach rank,' and 'self perceptions' of offensive and overall playing ability synthesize a multiple variable predictor model for NCAA Division I men's ice hockey. Two most important findings to this study can be summarized. First, players' self perceptions were highly and significantly correlated with playing performance. The more offensive a player perceived himself, the higher he tended to be ranked by his coach and the more offense he tended to produce. Second, and surprisingly, higher indicators of depression were positively and significantly correlated with 'Coaches Division I Rank,' highlighting the potential impact of student/athlete responsibilities and the conduct of Division I coaches on the mental health of student/athletes. These results can be used to further develop predictive models for performance in elite level ice-hockey, and other sports, and contribute to coaching and athletic administration practices within higher education.

AB - The purpose of this dissertation was to describe athletes' use of the functions of observational learning in various sport situations. A secondary purpose was to explore whether the Functions of Observational Learning Questionnaire (FOLQ; Cumming et al., 2005) could be used to examine naturalistic observational learning use with various groups of sport participants. To achieve these purposes, three studies were conducted. Study 1 examined the relationship between skill level, age, and use of the functions of observational learning in a sample of golfers. Study 2 explored the relationship between use of the functions of observational learning and self-efficacy beliefs in adult sport novices. Study 3 was a qualitative investigation of where, when, and why varsity athletes use observational learning, as well as what and who they observe in relation to their sport experiences. The results of Study 1 revealed that the interaction of age and skill level predicted golfers' use of the skill function of observational learning; whereas only age was a negative predictor of their use of the strategy and performance functions. This suggested that for golfers age-related factors were more important in determining observational learning use than skill-related factors. Study 2 showed that there were sport type differences in the relationship between observational learning use and self-efficacy beliefs for adult sport novices. For novices in independent sports, use of the skill function of observational learning positively predicted self-efficacy to learn skills and strategies. For novices in interactive sports, use of the performance function positively predicted self-efficacy to regulate mental states. Study 3 provided insight into the structure of athletes' observational learning use in practice, competition, and other training-related settings. Athletes indicated that they used observational learning for functions beyond those examined in previous research. With respect to what and who, athletes reported on the specific content and characteristics of their observations, as well as the specific models observed. Overall, the results of these three studies offer practical considerations and directions for future research in observational learning. It appears that the FOLQ (Cumming et al., 2005) can be used to examine sport participants' observational learning use and its relationship to proposed moderators and outcomes. As well, observer characteristics should be considered not only for their influence on observational learning for skills but for the other functions as well. Finally, researchers should consider examining observational learning use with a variety of approaches. Certainly interviewing techniques can provide information about how athletes employ observational learning in sport that is not available using quantitative approaches.

AB - The effect of anxiety on performance has been a topic of great research in recent times. As the business world becomes more and more competitive people, are looking for an edge to be better than the competition. This is also true in the world of sports. This work is a comprehensive program that can effectively help an athlete to obtain, maintain and sustain a mental state that is conducive with peak performance. The program will span nine sessions to be completed within a three week span of time. A specific importance is placed in using the athlete's position coach as part of the treatment team. In addition to the implementation of the coaches thoughts the athlete will be taught to self hypnotize, in order to be able to enter the optimal performance zone at will. This program will help athletes to be more marketable to the teams that they play for. Increasing the likelihood of peak performance will bring more wins to the teams, leading to championships and increased profitability for athletes, teams and universities.

AB - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to determine competency expectations for entry level supervisory employees in the golf and club management industry. Design/methodology/approach: The study was conducted with members of a Chapter of the Club Managers Association of America. A 20-question survey was developed for the study to identify desired competencies to be acquired by the next generation golf and club management professional. The survey was distributed electronically. Findings: Competencies identified for entry level golf and club management positions were similar to those required for current effectiveness of club managers already in practice and comparable to the more recognized hospitality industries of restaurants and hotels. The findings also demonstrate the overall impressions of practitioners concerning levels of preparation for entry level positions in the industry. Practical implications: The paper presents conclusions and suggestions for collaborative initiatives aimed at improving the preparation of individuals for successful entry into hospitality and tourism industry employment. Originality/value: The golf and club management industry is challenged by an insufficient number of qualified applicants for management vacancies. The research offers new approaches to recruitment and development of entry level managerial candidates. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - This study investigates the use of psychology services in teams of the top division Spanish leagues of handball, basketball, volleyball, indoor soccer, soccer and field hockey. Personal interviews were conducted to determine the composition of the multidisciplinary teams. The response rate was 81.8% (77 of 94). Though most teams have different professionals employed on a full-time basis, only 15.6% of these teams have a sport psychologist. Moreover, only three teams have a full-time sports psychologist. These results indicate that, compared to other professional services, managers and/or coaches do not perceive the need for psychological services. We discarded the hypothesis that most of the teams do not hire psychologists due to financial reasons. Sport psychology associations should reinforce the importance of the psychologist to enhance sports performance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - The application of psychology to sport and exercise settings is a relatively new field which is rapidly developing and expanding. This branch of psychology is concerned with understanding the behavior, mental processes, and well-being of people who are involved in sport and exercise. Practitioners typically specialize in either the sport or exercise branches, though some work equally in both fields. This new book presents invigorating recent research in the field.

AB - Sport Psychology is a senior undergraduate textbook that provides a synthesis of the major topics in sport psychology with an applied focus and an emphasis on achieving optimal performance. After the introductory chapters, there are three main sections to the text: Performance Enhancement covers topics such as anxiety, routines, mental imagery, self-talk, concentration, relaxation, goals, and self-confidence. The section on Performance Inhibition includes chapters on choking under pressure, self-handicapping, procrastination, perfectionism, substance abuse, burnout, and injury. While much of the information presented is universally applicable, individual differences based on gender, ethnicity, age, and motivation are emphasized in the concluding section on Individuals and Teams .

AB - The key study by Morgan and Pollock used both qualitative and quantitative methods to look at the psychological profiles of elite middle-long distance runners, elite marathon runners, and college middle distance runners. Using a multi-method approach of this nature enabled the researchers to collect complementary data. Interview data typically provides rich, detailed, individual-specific information; while data collected using standardized questionnaires enables comparisons to be made across the different groups of runners and between the runners and participants in other sports. The study by Morgan and Pollock was not the first to consider the relationship between personality characteristics and athletic success and even at the time of publication there was a substantial body of research in this area. However, a strength of the key study was that it was one of a series of papers published by Morgan and his associates into the personality attributes of athletes from a range of sports. This systematic approach to the study of personality attributes greatly facilitated comparisons across sports, levels, and how athletes may differ from non-athletes. The key study not only focused on data comprising state and trait personality profiles but also, interestingly, used qualitative data to explore elite distance runners' cognitive processes during competition. While a great deal of information was presented in the original publication, what follows is an abridged version and some of the physiological data and lifestyle data (e.g., amount of coffee drunk) are not presented. The key study by Morgan and Pollock reported a great deal of qualitative and quantitative data about the psychological make-up of distance runners. Many themes emerged from the key study, and while it is impossible to cover all in detail, the focus is on how subsequent research has developed in three main areas: the validity of predicting athletic success using scores from the Profile of Mental States; the relationship between personality and performance; and the relationship between personality and participation in sport.

AB - Qualitative forms of research have been present in sport psychology scholarship for roughly 15 years. The relative recency of their arrival reflects on the legitimacy issue and trends in the preparation of our young researchers. But qualitative forms of research have a strong current presence in our field. In their review of publication trends in sport psychology, Culver, Gilbert, and Trudel (2003) found that roughly 17.3% of data-based articles published in the major North American sport psychology research journals during the 1990s relied primarily on qualitative research methods. This proportion of research is likely to grow in the coming years. The focus of this chapter will be on identifying the current and potential contributions of qualitative research approaches to our knowledge base. The chapter will not discuss how to do qualitative research. Instead, it will concentrate on identifying the underlying philosophical principles of qualitative research because they generally differ from the fundamental principles of the quantitative research tradition. In addition, exemplars of qualitative research will be provided to describe the various expressions of qualitative research within our field of study.

AB - Despite the wealth of productive research examining the concept of competitive anxiety, the notion of 'facilitating' or 'positive anxiety' has recently stimulated an exciting conceptual debate amongst researchers (Burton and Naylor, 1997; Hanton and Connaughton, 2002; Hardy, 1997, 1998; Jones and Hanton, 2001, Mellalieu, Hanton, and Jones, 2003). One perspective postulates that high levels of cognitive anxiety can be perceived as facilitating to performance (Hardy, 1997). The opposing view maintains that, such cognitive symptoms are purported to reflect positive expectations of coping and goal achievement and lead to positive emotions including 'challenge' or 'excitement' (Burton, 1998; Burton and Naylor, 1997). The purpose of the study therefore was to examine the suggestion that facilitating interpretations of symptoms associated with the competitive stress response may be representative of some other positive affective state other than anxiety. 322 competitive athletes, sampled from a range of team and individual sports aged 18-29 years ( M = 24.8, SD = 3.1) completed the modified Competitive Trait Anxiety Inventory-2 (CTAI-2; Martens, Burton, Vealey, Bump, and Smith, 1990), the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (Watson and Tellegen, 1988), and adapted from the work of Jones and Hanton (1996, 2001) a measure of feeling states, the Pre-Performance Feelings Scale (PPFS; Mellalieu, 2000). Three separate one-way MANOVA's were conducted with groups (debilitated versus facilitated) as the independent variable and performers' PPFS, PANAS and CTAI-2 subscales as the dependent variables respectively. All three MANOVA's were found to be significant with follow-up univariate analyses revealing differences between debilitators and facilitators of competitive trait anxiety for mental readiness, confidence and perception of physical state subscales of the PPFS and the positive and negative affect subscales of the PANAS. Correlation analyses revealed negative affect as more important in mediating competitive trait anxiety intensity, while positive affect was found to be more important in mediating competitive trait anxiety direction. Strong relationships were also found between the direction of competitive trait anxiety and positive and negative subscales of the PPFS. The findings indicate that sports performers' facilitative interpretations of symptoms associated with competitive anxiety responses may indeed be representative of some other positive affective state. Further, this positive affective state experienced in the precompetition period may therefore be more influential in determining successful sports performance than the existing belief that suggests competitive anxiety per se is the key factor in accounting for performance. Finally, the oxymoron of 'positive anxiety' is discussed in light of the study findings regarding the difference between true feelings of anxiety resulting in performance benefits versus the interpretation of associated symptoms having a similar positive influence. Practical implications and significant future recommendations for the practitioner are also offered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)

AB - This reprinted article originally appeared in Journal of Neuropsychiatry & Clinical Neurosciences , 2005, Vol 17, pp. 297-303. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2005-10726-001.) Neuropsychological testing is increasingly used in initial assessment of concussion, both on and off the field. In the late 1980's, The University of Virginia completed the first large scale research study on MTBI in athletes. Neuropsychological testing was utilized to assess cognitive function prior to and following concussion. The Pittsburgh Steelers began using neuropsychological testing in the 1990's to determine return to play decisions. It is now used in other areas of professional athletics, including ice hockey and auto racing. Neuropsychological batteries are also utilized for assessment of short and long term post concussive symptoms. Several return to play guidelines have been developed, based on the degree of symptomatology experienced by the athlete. These guidelines have slight differences in their definitions of grades of concussion and recommendations. At present, all are based on expert opinion rather than prospective studies. Ideally, baseline testing is obtained at the beginning of the season. At the time of injury, testing is repeated. The choice of specific neuropsychological tests varies, but a battery is chosen to assess cognitive skills including immediate and delayed recall, orientation, verbal memory, attention span, word fluency, visual scanning and coordination. Methods of testing range from sideline assessment to computer based inventories (e.g. Immediate Post Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT)). Neuropsychological testing is beginning to play a more integral role in the evaluation of the concussed athlete. Functional imaging studies allow comparison pre- and post-injury. In this context, fMRI, ERP, and MSI are promising tools in the evaluative process. It is critical to find a means of detecting possible neurological consequences of MTBI, however subtle, and identifying the neuropsychological and neurophysiological impairments caused by a sports-related concussion. Specifically, assessing recovery for several brain functions and their underlying neuronal mechanisms will permit development of tools for rapid and efficient diagnosis. Further, a better understanding of recovery will guide return to play decisions as well as special measures and accommodations that need to be taken to carry out daily activities.

AB - The purposes of the study in this chapter were to evaluate the use of salivary cortisol to measure stress experienced by athletes and to study the relationship between pre-competitions stress and personality of athletes. Sixteen swimmers representing Hong Kong in regional and international competition were recruited for the study. In the laboratory, swimmers were instructed to perform a mental arithmetic test and its purpose is to arouse the participant's stress level. They were then being led through the diaphragmatic breathing technique to help them relax. The stress levels of the swimmers at pre-arousal, post-arousal, and post-relaxation were monitored by salivary cortisol, skin conductance, respiratory rate, shortened State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-6), and self-reported subjective score. Changes in salivary cortisol agreed with changes in all other stress measurements (skin conductance, respiratory rate, STAI and subjective stress score). Salivary cortisol is a possible parameter to be used for monitoring stress level of athletes. The pre-competition stress experienced by the swimmers was also measured at a local competition. Athletes were instructed to provide a saliva sample for cortisol measurement, to complete the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2 (CSAI-2) and a subjective stress scale 30-60 minutes prior to their respective competition event. The average of saliva cortisol levels as obtained on three rest days were used as baseline for comparison. Salivary cortisol as obtained prior to competition although was higher than that obtained on the rest days, the difference was not statistically significant. It seems that the competition under study was not stressful enough to the swimmers. Attempt was also made to study whether pre-competitive stress correlated to individual's personality (sensation seeking and coping skill). No significant correlation between pre-competition stress and personality was identified in the study. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)

AB - The ways in which people deal with the stresses of sports competition are called coping strategies (Lazarus and Folkman, 1984). Recently Gaudreau and Blondin (2002) developed the multidimensional Coping Inventory for Competitive Sports (CICS) and provided strong evidence using confirmatory factor analysis for the existence of ten coping strategies used in sporting competition (thought control, mental imagery, relaxation, effort expenditure, logical analysis, seeking support, venting of unpleasant emotion, mental distraction, disengagement and social withdrawal). The aims of this study were to extend the findings of Gaudreau and Blondin (2002) to test the higher-order factor structure of the CICS, and examine the structural and differential stability of the CICS over four time points. Results suggested that a two-factor higher order model of task oriented and emotional oriented coping best fitted the data. Measurement invariance was observed for all subscales. Latent growth curve models suggested subscale scores decreased over time. At the second order factor level the use of task oriented coping decreased over the 10-week season, whereas the use of emotional oriented coping remained stable.

AB - This chapter discusses the LAPD's threat management unit. The few pages of this chapter cannot cover all the nuances or issues that may be encountered during a stalking or threat investigation. The author attempts to provide a template for investigations that will facilitate the identification of key issues with options for case management. The Los Angeles TMU maintains files of each case handled since our inception. From 1990 through April 2007, the TMU has investigated 3,098 cases involving stalking, threats, and other obsessive behavior. Although the ratios have shifted throughout the years because of added responsibilities, over 55% of the total cases handled have involved celebrities, sports personalities, elected officials, or other public figures as victims. Our files indicate that persons suffering from severe mental disorders are far less likely as a group to approach or confront the objects of their fixation. That particular statistic, however, would offer no comfort to the family, friends, and fans who mourn the loss of Rebecca Schaeffer. Every case needs to be evaluated independently and on its own merit. Each victim, each subject, and each case is different. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)

AB - Although originally identified in the work setting as staff burnout, this metaphor has found significant resonance within the sport community where it is now considered a colloquialism. This key study by Gould et al. (see record 1996-09105-003) was the second in a series of three from an original research programs commissioned by the Sport Science Division of the US Tennis Association. The study represented one of the first empirical investigations of athlete burnout, and remains one of the most in-depth explorations within the existent literature. The study was divided into two phases of investigation. Phase one consisted of the completion of a battery of psychological and social psychological inventories, the results of which were contrasted across the comparative samples in the first article (see record 1996-09105-002). In addition, a sub-sample ( n =10) of burned-out players were selected from the findings of phase one to participate in in-depth interviews during the second phase of the study. This part of the research comprised the key study presented in this chapter. It reports physical and mental characteristics of burnout, recommendations for preventing burnout and an examination of three existing models of athlete burnout. The key study also promoted the novel suggestion of the existence of different types or strains of burnout. The final article in the series (see record 1997-07121-002) presented three case studies of the experiences of individual burnout players. This key study represented landmark research in the field. The research questions posed, as well as the design of the study, has had a significant impact to the advancement of knowledge and understanding in this area of sport psychology.

AB - Elite athletes are required to spend several years in preparing themselves for world-caliber international sporting events such as the Olympic Games. This preparation is comprised of physical, technical, tactical—and psychological—training. The purpose of this paper is to describe the four-year psychological preparation program given to Israeli elite athletes whose goal is to participate in the 2008 Olympic Games. The paper provides the general psychological framework used in each of the four years of preparation. The objectives of the three psychological programs used during the psychological preparation—the Five-Step Approach, Specific Psychological Training Program, and Response Training Program—are described. Specific examples of the use of the psychological program in judo and rhythmic gymnastics are given. Two practical tips are suggested for sport psychologists who engage in multi-year preparation of elite athletes for the Olympic Games.

Nine sources of confidence were identified: Preparation, performance accomplishments, coaching, innate factors, social support, experience, competitive advantage, self-awareness, and trust. A testament to the multi-dimensional nature of sport confidence, six types of sport confidence were also identified: skill execution, achievement, physical factors, psychological factors, superiority to opposition, and tactical awareness. Gender was related to both the sources of confidence and the subsequent types of confidence experienced by the athletes. For example, females placed more importance on good personal performances than males who derived confidence from winning. Results were discussed in the context of previous sport confidence literature and implications for sport psychology and coaching practices were drawn.

The participants included 401 individuals between the ages of 18 to 65 (M = 38.75, SD = 13.75) who completed demographic assessments, a measure of leisure time exercise (Godin & Shephard, 1985), and the Exercise Imagery Inventory (Giacobbi, Hausenblas, & Penfield, 2005). The results indicated that active individuals used appearance/health imagery significantly more than those who were less active while a significant age by activity level interaction was also observed. Pairwise comparisons revealed that 18- to 25-yars olds who were more active reported significantly greater use of exercise technique than 45- to 65-year old individuals within the same activity level classification. A significant gender-by-age interaction also revealed that 18- to 25-year-old males reported significantly greater use of technique imagery than 45- to 65-year old males. Theoretical and practical issues in the study of mental imagery within exercise settings are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - Objective: To determine the feasibility of the Structural Dimension Analysis of Motor Memory (SDA-M), a method derived from sports psychology, in establishing the mental representations of complex movements in patients after stroke. Design: Case series of patients, with age-matched healthy controls. Setting: A rehabilitation nursing home. Subjects: Sixteen patients 3-26 weeks after their stroke, and 16 controls. Intervention: Each control had the SDA-M performed within a 10-day period. Each stroke patient had the SDA-M performed once. In the SDA-M the subject was asked to state for each of 10 actions involved in drinking from a cup whether it is functionally close to each of the other nine or not. Main measures: The raw data from the SDA-M were transformed through cluster analysis into Euclidean distances and tree diagrams to illustrate the internal representation of the action. Results: All subjects were able to perform the assessment. Healthy controls all had a similar set of Euclidean distances and tree diagrams that were 'normal'. The tree diagrams remained very similar on the three occasions. Four stroke patients had tree diagrams that were 'normal'. The remaining twelve had tree diagrams that differed greatly both from the 'normal' and from each other, with much less clustering of actions. Patients with more severe stroke appeared to have more disordered tree diagrams. Conclusion: The Structural Dimension Analysis of Motor Memory (SDA-M) is a feasible method for investigating the mental representation of internal motor action plans in stroke patients, giving similar data in stable healthy people and revealing abnormal patterns in patients after stroke.

This article documents the evolution of this type of position at Virginia Tech and includes a discussion of the goals of the clinical sport psychologist position, an overview of the daily activities the position entails, and a discussion of the issues that comprise the assessment, conceptualization, and treatment of student-athlete concerns. Models for conceptualizing and delivering sport psychology interventions are also discussed. Evidence indicates that having access to a mental health professional familiar with the issues facing college athletes can be instrumental in helping many of these student-athletes achieve success in the university setting.

AB - Clinical sport psychology consultation in the fast-paced and high-stakes world of intercollegiate athletics provides the clinician with a challenging set of experiences. The culture of intercollegiate athletics and the demands of academics and intensive training create an undercurrent that psychologists must factor into their work with student-athlete clients. One must be well trained so as to best meet the complex, growing, mental health needs of older adolescents and young adult college students whose lives are also impacted by the normal developmental tasks of people of this age. Accordingly, to be effective, clinicians working in this setting must be well aware of the numerous unique ethical challenges that have the potential to impact their practice. Such ethical challenges may stem from issues dealing with the athlete, coach, athletic department personnel, compliance with NCAA rules and regulations, or legal issues surrounding this setting. It is the purpose of this paper to clarify several of these possible ethical challenges. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - Cricket is suffused in memory. Both playing and appreciating the game centrally involve various forms of remembering. This essay focuses on the distinction between explicit autobiographical remembering and the kind of habitual or 'procedural' memory involved in complex embodied skills like batting. Generally considered the province of psychology or cognitive science, the phenomenon of habit or skill memory has been largely neglected by philosophical anthropology and the philosophy of mind. However a number of intrinsically interesting questions concerning batting in particular arise when considered from this perspective. While drawing upon ideas from psychology and cognitive anthropology, the argument is supplemented with accounts from general testimony and cricket writing, phenomenology, and other investigations of the embodied mind. While starting from the prevalent view that thinking too much disrupts the practiced, embodied skills involved in batting, the essay suggests that experts do in fact successfully learn mental techniques for how to influence themselves in action, and that the kinds of explicit thought and memory in question are themselves active, dynamic and context-sensitive.

AB - The purpose of this article is to examine how phase-specific psychological interventions were used in an annual training program of elite male basketball players. Psychological intervention introduced to elite athletes during their training program reflects the aims of each critical phase of the program, namely the preparation, competition, and transition phases. In addition, while conducting psychological consultations, the sport psychologist should take into consideration the specific objectives of other preparations in the training program, such as the physical, technical, and tactical. The specific psychology intervention in each phase of the basketball training program, the philosophical approach to the intervention process, and the reasoning behind the use of the certain psychological techniques at each specific phase of the program are discussed.

AB - This study employed ordinal logistic regression analyses to investigate the relationship between American adolescents' participation in physical activity and depressive symptomatology. Data were drawn from the second Child Development Supplement to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (CDS II), which was conducted over 2002-2003. Fewer than 60% of adolescents were found to accumulate 60 min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) outside of school hours on week or weekend days. Accumulated duration of MVPA was not, however, significantly associated with severity of depressive symptoms for either gender. Males who were not involved in sporting clubs or lessons were more likely than males who were highly involved to experience greater severity of depressive symptoms (OR = 3.24, CI = 1.33, 7.87). Results highlight gender variability in the psychosocial correlates of sporting participation and prompt further investigation of the relevance of current physical activity guidelines for mental health in adolescence.

AB - Reviews the book, The psychology of coaching team sports: A self-help guide by L. M. Leith (see record 2004-13001-000). The author wrote the book as a response to coaches' needs to provide sport psychological aids for competitive teams to constructively deal with team issues, implementing practical solutions, and giving psychological direction for athletes in preparation for and during competition. In each chapter, the author outlines the essential theoretical underpinnings of the specific topic in conjunction with coaching applications. The book consists of nine chapters that could be broadly divided into three main sections, which concentrate on team climate, psychological variables and intervention methods, and aggression, staleness, and burnout. The book will be a valuable read for coaches who would like to implement and refine sport psychological methods to give their teams the competitive edge. The book provides a good and easy-to-understand overview of the main personal and situational variables that could influence team performance. The guidance given on the various topics would benefit parents of team athletes, particularly younger athletes, because parents spend a substantial amount of time with the athletes.

AB - The purpose of this study was to examine stressors, coping strategies, and perceived coping effectiveness among international adolescent rugby players. Eleven English international adolescent rugby union players (M age = 17.9 years) maintained diaries over a 31-day period. The diaries included a stressor checklist, an open-ended coping responses section, and a Likert-type scale evaluation of coping effectiveness. Total reported stressors and coping strategies for the 31-day period were tallied, and the data were subsequently analyzed longitudinally. Overall, the most frequently-cited stressors were making a physical error, receiving coach/parental criticism, making a mental error, injury, and observing an opponent play well. The most frequently cited coping strategies were blocking, increased effort, and taking advice. Coping effectiveness appeared to be related to the choice of the coping strategy deployed. Strategies such as blocking and technical adjustments were generally rated as being more effective than strategies such as self-talk and increasing effort.

AB - The purpose of this explorative small-scale evaluation was to examine the effects of a ten-month team-based sport psychology service delivery aimed to enhance the coping skills of 21 professional soccer players. Principles from cognitive behaviour therapy were instrumental in each weekly match preparation. A 16-item screening questionnaire on the individual player's perception of his coping capacity and strategies was dispensed to each player prior to and after the intervention period. It covered various aspects of coping skills before and during matches and addressed if and how each player would seek to help a team-mate with match performance problems. The comparison of pre and post service delivery scores showed a significant increase in the amount of sport psychology literature read, the use of specific coping skills during matches, and the offering of more specialized help to team-mates after the intervention.

AB - In the sport of springboard and platform diving, subjective scoring is used. Based on a ten point scale, judges give immediate scores which reflect the diver's performance. Each diver performs a proscribed number of dives and the total of all dives is tallied to decide final placement. While final placement in a competition is determined by physical skill, a diver's mental state often determines how successful the athlete will in the competition. While there is a plethora of literature that has examined attributions of physical education classes and other sports, there is a dearth of studies addressing the attributional style of elite NCAA male and female divers. Diving requires extreme athleticism, fearlessness and a heightened kinesthetic awareness in becoming both skill-proficient and competitive. This in turn requires intrinsic motivation to meet those challenges as well as being able to make causal attributions from one competition to the next. The purpose of this study is to determine the attributional style of elite NCAA male and female divers as well as to determine if there is a difference in attributional style between male and female divers. Further, this study will determine if the attributive style is related to performance and whether there is a difference between elite NCAA male and female divers. The study will take place at the 2005 NCAA Men's and Women's Diving Championships. At each event and at the completion of his/her final diving event, each athlete will be asked to complete a self-report questionnaire---the Attributional Style Questionnaire. An objective rating of each diver's performance will be paired with his or her attributional style, as measured by the questionnaire. These data will be analyzed statistically to determine if gender has an effect on the attributional style of elite NCAA male and female divers.

AB - The game of tennis is one of the most demanding of all sports, requiring physical strength and stamina, technical expertise, and mental prowess. Experts and recreational players alike are challenged by fast exchanges, limited space, and varying situations. Regardless of ability or age; however, winning and losing often lies in the perceptual-cognitive skills of the competitor, specifically their visual perception and decision-making capabilities. Though several viable training protocols have been shown to improve the anticipatory skills of dynamic sport athletes, such findings have generally been limited to junior and young adult athletes during laboratory-based tasks. Furthermore, the extant literature has failed to index how well these skills are retained after having been trained. The purpose of this investigation, therefore, was to examine the effectiveness of training situation awareness, anticipation, and decision-making (MPCT) in senior tennis players, when compared to anticipation-only (AT), technique-footwork (TFT), or no training. These training protocols were assessed in live x competitive performance situations both immediately following training and then six-weeks later. Intermediate/advanced senior tennis players (N = 50) were randomly assigned to one of the aforementioned groups according to gender and level of cognitive impairment, and were pretested in a 4-game set. After receiving five group-specific training sessions (30 min each), participants were posttested in a 4-game set, and again following a six-week retention period. Findings indicated that senior tennis players who received MPCT responded nearly twice as fast, two times more accurately, and made more than twice as many correct decisions during live, competitive match play when compared to AT, TFT, and control. More importantly, improvements made in response speed, response accuracy, and performance decision-making were retained in response demonstrating functional learning effects occurred. Along with improving these skills of interest, multidimensional perceptual-cognitive trained participants also won a higher percentage of points and games. These abilities were found to be beneficial to healthy older athletes and, specifically, those suffering from age-related cognitive declines. Suggestions are provided for future research in sport and dynamic life activities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - The purposes of this study were to measure the dispositional and situational flow of female postcollegiate rugby players in the nine dimensions of flow; to determine the relationships between the players' dispositional and situational flow and their intrinsic motivation, the players' dispositional and situational flow and their psychological skills, and the players' intrinsic motivation and psychological skills; and to develop a multivariate framework to evaluate the relative importance of situational and dispositional flow with intrinsic motivation and psychological skills. Participants consisted of 44 post-collegiate female rugby players from the Eastern Pennsylvania Rugby Union (EPRU). They completed the Flow State Scale-2 (FSS-2), the Nine Mental Skills of Successful Athletes Scale (9MSSA), the Sport Motivation Scale (SMS), the Dispositional Flow Scale-2 (DFS-2), and demographic questions. The data were analyzed using univariate, bivariate, and multivariate statistics. There was little variation among participants demographically. The participants did experience flow through the nine dimensions of flow, with some dimensions stronger than others. The participants were found to be intrinsically motivated to participate, and they used psychological skills for their sport. Bivariate statistics consisted of Pearson r correlations, t-tests, and ANOVA's. Moderate relationships existed between the 9MSSA global and the FSS-2 global, and the 9MSSA global and the IM global. Low correlations existed between the IM global and the FSS-2 global, and the IM global and the DFS-2 global. Multivariate linear regressions were used to analyze the data. Three models were run for the FSS-2 and DFS-2, the significant 9MSSA subscales, and the significant IM subscales. Full reduced regressions for the FSS-2 indicated that the DFS-2 challenge-skill balance variable was the most influential predictor, explaining 54.8% of the variation of situational flow. Full reduced regressions for the DFS-2 indicated that two variables, FSS-2 merging of action and awareness and 9MSSA attitude, were strong predictors of dispositional flow, explaining 58% of the variation. Further research is needed with a larger group of participants, as well as participants in other sports. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - The aim of the current research was to compare the prevalence of self-reported symptoms of exercise addiction in sports sciences students with those of the general exercising population. A total of 455 participants (261 sports science students; 194 controls) completed the Exercise Addiction Inventory. Sport science students had significantly higher mean scores on the Exercise Addiction Inventory than exercisers from the general population. It was also found that 6.9% (18 out of 261) sport science students were possibly addicted to exercise compared to only 3.6% (7 out of 194) of the general exercising population, a result that approached statistical significance (p = 0.09). These findings raise the possibility that sports science students may be more susceptible to some components of exercise addiction than exercisers more generally.

AB - A systematic review was conducted on the utilisation of mental imagery in its contribution to improvements in exercise performance and behaviour. Research into imagery use in exercise is in its infancy, and thus, there have been conceptual, measurement and methodological inconsistencies. The purpose of the current paper was to review the empirical literature thus far on exercise imagery. It was concluded that exercise imagery might indeed prove to be an effective tool in enhancing performance and adherence in physical activity programmes; however, the refinement of measurement tools is required in order to further evaluate its nature and efficacy. Furthermore, the employment of a recently developed conceptual model for the use of imagery in exercise offers a theoretical direction to future research contributions, and in the design of imagery interventions in the exercise domain.

AB - Imagery research has accumulated in two main waves since it was first investigated over a century ago. Firstly, in a period roughly extending over a century from the 1890s to the 1990s, several hundred experiments focused on the efficacy of the "mental practice" effect. More recently, attempts to shed light on the precise tasks or functions for which athletes use visualization in actual sport situations have led to an upsurge in imagery research. Central to this second wave of research is the imagery use framework (Hall et al., 1998), which has led to over 20 studies. Unfortunately, despite making significant advances these studies have a number of limitations, including a failure to include elite participants and the fact that they have largely overlooked meta-imagery abilities of the athletes. To address these issues, semi-structured interviews were used to explore imagery experiences among elite athletes. Canoe-slalom, which had been subject to previous research on imagery (e.g., White & Hardy, 1998), was the chosen sport. Five female and seven male elite level competitors (age= 25 years; SD = 4.16) participated. Findings from the elite athlete sample were inconsistent with previous research with regard to the motivational function of images. Furthermore, the athletes demonstrated a sophisticated understanding of imagery processes including imagery of realistic behaviours rather than perfect performance. Interestingly, the frequency of debilitative imagery was surprising given previous findings but may have been a consequence of the qualitative methods employed. Finally, examination of the meta-imagery construct proved valuable and is worthy of further research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - It has long been known that athletes use mental imagery extensively for a variety of different purposes. Although many of these purposes have been well documented, several gaps remain in our understanding of atheletes' imagery experiences. First, the issue of negative or debilitative imagery among athletes has received little research attention in sports psychology. In addition, until recently, athletes’ meta-imagery processes (i.e., their beliefs about the nature and regulation of their own imagery skills) have been neglected. So, the purpose of the present study is to use qualitative methodology to explore meta-imagery processes and imagery direction (i.e., facilitative or debilitative) in elite sports performers. The sample comprised seven participants from motor-sport, rugby, fencing and golf (mean age = 24.43 years; SD = 1.99). Results showed that motivational aspects of imagery were not as relevant to our sample of elite performers as they appear to have been in previous studies using non-elite samples. In addition, the elite performers in our study showed evidence of sophisticated meta-imagery control skills – being able, for example, to restructure negative imagery so that it facilitates future performance. Finally, our elite sample’s experience of imagery direction seems to be more complex than had previously been believed. For example, some athletes reported deliberately imagining errors in order to prepare for "worst-case" scenarios in competition (hence using such imagery to facilitate their performance). Overall, we propose that existing imagery use taxonomies that need to be revised to take into account the flexibility with which elite athletes actually employ imagery.

AB - The unique physiological attributes of marathoners have long been recognised, but until the pioneering research of Morgan and Pollock (1977) little was known about their psychological characteristics. Their work revealed marathoners have significantly better mental health compared with non-athletes, with desirable mental health variables being most pronounced in elite competitors. It was also found that during competition, elite marathoners typically utilise a unique cognitive strategy labeled 'association', whereby they regulate pace based upon bodily sensations including pain and effort. More recent research indicates there are considerable individual differences in the psychological responses of marathoners to the stressors associated with training and competition, and in some cases negative emotions traditionally presumed to be harmful actually benefit performance. This brief review will highlight findings of psychological research involving marathoners and other endurance athletes, distinguishing between characteristics common among groups (i.e. nomothetic) with those particular to individuals (i.e. ideographic) or sub-groups of elite and non-elite competitors.

AB - Different studies have suggested that the majority of self-talk during exercise is either positive or neutral in character. The majority of 'thoughts' during low-intensity exercise have been described as being dissociative conversational chatter. However, with increasing exercise intensity, there is a greater percentage of associative and motivational thoughts, which includes thoughts about feeling and affect, body monitoring, command, instruction and pace monitoring. It has been suggested that self-talk is necessary for creating a time 'wedge' between the activity described by the self-talk, and the self-talk itself. The information redundancy created by this time-wedge allows the capacity for reflection about what is occurring, and self-awareness of the part played by the individual themselves in the activity being performed. Self-talk may be a discussion between a singular 'I' and a singular 'me', or may be a multi-party dialogue. There are anatomical correlates to self-talk, with neural activity in a number of brain areas related to the occurrence of both overt and subvocal self-talk, particularly in Broca's region in the left fontal cortex, and Wernicke's region in the left posterior superior temporal cortex. Whether specific training of self-talk can improve performance is controversial, although recent studies have suggested that task-specific self-talk appears to have a beneficial effect on physical performance. Further studies are required to assess the ability of physical or mental training to modify self-talk in a beneficial and permanent manner, and whether these changes affect an individual's exercise performance and sense of self.

AB - Athletics and sport are so often a part of collegiate life, it is not unusual to hear accounts of high school students selecting a college home based primarily on the promise or hope of playing on, or cheering for, a particular athletic team. When television cameras follow the action or pan the student crowds at athletic events, members of the academic community are often aware that, for prospective students, identification with the members of that crowd or the players in that athletic venue is as important as attaining any particular academic goal. Although perhaps unlikely to be in the forefront of their minds, counseling center staff members realize that such scenes are populated with the many students who will make use of, and eventually benefit from, the services provided by the counseling center. Student athletes are often perceived as overindulged and pampered, but many of these students, stressed by the lifestyle; the alternating fame and scrutiny; and the multitasking required in managing, studying, and playing a sport, can benefit from counseling. College counselors, however, often have little opportunity to work with student athletes. Social pressures to be self-reliant and strong influence many of these students to avoid counseling, that is, unless counseling staff members have shown their commitment to the athletic domain, developed connections with the coaches and teams, and gained their trust. This chapter seeks to identify key issues faced by student athletes and primary pathways to effective involvement by the counselor with this particular clientele. Although there may be little difference in how counselors treat the presenting problems of depression, heartbreak, career selection anxiety, or learning disabilities of athlete and nonathlete students following initial intake, college counselors may maximize their effectiveness with student athletes by developing specialized competency in sport psychology. The assessment and counseling of student athletes are most effective when provided by a counselor who has connections with and sensitivity to the athletic domain.

AB - This chapter originally appeared in the Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology , 1995, Vol. 17(2), 185-199. (The following abstract appeared in record 1996-03328-001). Examined studies from 1971-1992 on the Profile of Mood States (POMS), commonly used to measure mental health in athletes. Athletes scoring below norms on scales of tension, depression, confusion, anger, and fatigue and above norms on vigor are said to possess a positive profile, graphically depicted as an iceberg. The predictive power of the iceberg profile has recently been questioned. A meta-analysis was conducted on 33 studies comparing the POMS scores of athletes differing in success to estimate the magnitude of the findings. The overall effect size was calculated to be 0.15. Although this value was significantly different from zero, the amount of variance accounted for was less than 1%. Results suggest that across many different sports and levels of performance, successful athletes possess a mood profile slightly more positive than less successful athletes; however, the lack of strong support for the POMS in predicting athletic success reflects poorly on the mental health model proposed by W. P. Morgan (1985). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)(create)

AB - If the typical professional boxer spends the bulk of his time outside the ring, endlessly rehearsing his moves in front of a mirror or on an assortment of bags so as to hone his technique, increase his power, and sharpen his speed and coordination, and even outside the gym eating up miles and miles of daily 'roadwork', the climax and yardstick of training remains the sparring. The point of sparring--one also says 'putting on the gloves' and 'moving around'--is to approximate the conditions of the fight, with the difference that the boxers wear protective headgear and heavily padded gloves and that, as we will see, the brutality of the confrontation is greatly attenuated. Without regular practice in the ring against an opponent, the rest of the preparation would make little sense, for the peculiar mix of skills and qualities required by fighting cannot be assembled but between the ropes. After providing an account of going to a sparring gym, this chapter discusses the social logic of sparring. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(create)

The pilot team (comprising one consultant clinical psychologist, three mental health nurses and an administrator) operates out of a partner non-statutory youth agency--Cheltenham Community Projects (CCP)--based in Cheltenham town centre. We aim to assess and treat people between the ages of 14 and 35 experiencing or at risk of first-episode psychosis using a bio-psychosocial approach and an assertive outreach team caseload model (see www.gripinitiative.org.uk). This chapter is an account of how the GRIP team launched first a well attended sports group for service users and then started a carers' sports group. More importantly it highlights some of the opinions and experiences of participating users of our service (carers and people with psychosis).

AB - How we are viewed by others in our environment has numerous implications for the way in which we are perceived, treated, and evaluated. Sport represents an environment in which presentation of one's self in a favorable manner can have positive implications for an individual. Various strategies have been suggested that can be employed to create a favorable impression. It is this notion of self-presentational concern that will form the basis for this chapter. This chapter will illustrate that when people are concerned about the impressions others form of them, they may adopt a particular strategy such as self-handicapping to create a favorable impression. To this end, this chapter reviews the self-handicapping and sport literature and is divided into four main sections. The first section focuses on self-presentation (impression management) and explains what it is and why it occurs. It also discusses self-handicapping, a self-presentation strategy, by explaining what it is, factors known to influence it, and costs associated with it. The second section reviews the self-handicapping and sport literature. The third section provides an overview of future research with an emphasis on methodological concerns and avenues of research, and the fourth section presents practical implications and recommendations for coaches.

"Class divisions" / John Hargreaves / Participation figures for sport are an indispensable tool when considering the place of sport in society, though the nature of the survey or study from which such figures stem must always be evaluated closely--and information from the websites of various sport organizations should be questioned when making claims about participation.

AB - This chapter originally appeared in Thai Journal of Sports Science , 1991, Vol. 1(1), 10-21. This review focuses on the application of sport psychology for elite athlete performance optimization. First, an overview of applied sport psychology and its role in athlete performance optimization is discussed. In particular, sport psychology is defined, general sport psychology research questions are delineated and common sport psychology myths are identified. Emphasis is placed on the need for an interdisciplinary sport science team approach to elite athlete preparation. Second, central or core sport psychology topics that are important to include in programs designed to facilitate elite athlete performance are discussed. Topics recommended for inclusion consist of anxiety and stress management, confidence enhancement, attention/concentration skills training, positive task oriented thought training, determination-motivation and commitment enhancement, goal setting, communication enhancement and imagery skills training. Finally, a general framework for designing and implementing psychological skills training programs is discussed. Steps contained in this framework include: (1) identifying psychological skill objectives; (2) operationally defining psychological skill objectives; (3) identifying strategies which can be used to develop specific psychological skills; (4) designing a psychological skills training schedule; (5) organizing a psychological skills training.

AB - This chapter originally appeared in Exercise and Sport Science Reviews , 1988, Vol. 16, 423-457. Self-confidence (SC) is one of the most cited factors thought to affect athletic performance. SC is said to play a critical role in athletes' success; in contrast, lack of SC seems to be closely associated with athletic failure. Thus, confidence is an important factor that distinguishes successful athletes from unsuccessful ones in terms of both their mental states as well as their performances. However, the precise nature of SC was quite unclear until the publication of Feltz's seminal chapter on this issue. The term self-confidence refers to one's belief that he or she can successfully execute a desired behavior (i.e., his or her belief of "I'll get the job done"). Feltz argued that the exact relationships of SC and performance in sport have not been scientifically clarified in a satisfactory manner. To promote our understanding of the precise nature of these relationships, she first presented several definitions of SC and briefly discussed them with reference to some related terms, such as perceived ability, self-concept, self-esteem, and performance expectancies. Feltz presented three of the major theoretical approaches available at that time for studying these relationships: Bandura's self-efficacy theory, Harter's perceived competence model, and Vealey's concept of sport confidence. She not only described the theoretical approaches but also provided extensive research evidence in sport and reviewed some relevant criticisms. Feltz summarized and compared these three approaches and derived some important conclusions referring to the (at that time) updated scientific status of the relationships between SC and sport performance. This seminal chapter did not, of course, completely resolve the riddle of SC in sport. However, Feltz organized and presented the theoretical knowledge relevant to SC in sport at that time and undoubtedly had a profound influence on many researchers in this area, which is theoretically intriguing and has a substantial practical importance for those actively involved in sport.

AB - This chapter originally appeared in Anabolic steroids in sport and exercise , 2000, 247-278. Some athletes are ready to do whatever it takes to gain a competitive advantage over their opponents. Accordingly, it is no secret that, for many years, the use of performance-enhancing substances, such as forbidden drugs, has been widespread among Olympians and other world-class athletes. Despite the fact that it is often difficult to obtain an accurate picture of substance abuse in span because of the sensitive and often private nature of the subject, it is quite clear that abuse of performance-enhancing drugs appears to be on the upswing. This is remarkable since drug abuse may have serious negative consequences that sometimes go far beyond the span domain itself (e.g., disqualification). Some former top athletes are now experiencing serious negative consequences of taking these drugs; even an early death has not been infrequent among such drug users. Bahrke undertook the challenge of reviewing nearly 50 reports concerning the psychological and behavioral effects of endogenous testosterone and anabolic-androgenic steroids. He began with discussing the effects of anabolic steroids on aggressive behavior in animals. Then he presented the relationships between levels of endogenous testosterone and moods and behavior in humans, with a special reference to aggressive behavior and to responses to winning and losing. He discussed estrogen-related aggression and described different effects of the clinical use of anabolic steroids on moods and behavior in human male contraceptive studies. Bahrke continued by presenting how the use of anabolic steroids affects athletes' mental health, including important issues such as psychological dependence and withdrawal. Finally, he concluded the chapter by discussing selected methodological issues related to the assessment of psychological and behavioral effects of anabolic steroids. Drugs per se should not be considered a problem, because not all substances are out of place in physical activity and sport settings. For example, antibiotics and even simple painkillers may be viewed as useful medical tools in sport. The use of harmful, illegal, and banned substances is considered the major problem in the exercise and span domain. Bahrke's seminal review chapter makes a substantial contribution to the clarification of this important and sometimes delicate issue.

AB - The present study examined the effects of an audience on measures of golf putting accuracy and EEG power and laterality in novice golfers. Twenty novice participants were asked to make 20 putts alone and 20 putts in front of an audience of about 5 strangers, with order counterbalanced across participants while wearing a portable EEG device. The putting accuracy of each condition, absolute power, and laterality scores were examined as a Junction of audience in two EEG epochs that were 2 and 1 second, respectively, before contact with the golf ball. Accuracy decreased and Beta 1 and Beta 2 power measures increased when participants were in front of an audience. Additionally, a significant increase in left hemisphere (LH) beta 1 activity, resulting in decreased symmetry, was observed in the audience-present condition. The results are contrary to those of Crews and Landers (1993) and others who have shown LH alpha increase as the athlete prepares their motor act, suggesting a difference between expert and novice golfers in their preparation for putting. Additionally, the interaction in the Beta band may indicate a sensitive marker for the effects of social inhibition on performance.

AB - Reviews the book, The Sport Psychologist's Handbook: A Guide for Sport-Specific Performance Enhancement by Joaquin Dosil (2006). This 704-page handbook, written by an array of sport psychology consultants from around the world, is constructed around the idea that sport psychologists will be able to provide higher quality services if they specialize in one sport. The text is structured logically, with the first five chapters providing basic information related to providing sport psychology services to athletes. A few chapters fail to meet the standards set by the majority of the authors. The most common problem is that they simply fail to provide information that is specific to the sport in question, instead discussing theories or mental skills in general. Several of the weaker chapters also provide too much technical detail or do not reference past research to support their claims. This book will be beneficial to any sport psychologist and especially to sport psychology students. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - We tested some of the key predictions of processing efficiency theory using a simulated rally driving task. Two groups of participants were classified as either dispositionally high or low anxious based on trait anxiety scores and trained on a simulated driving task. Participants then raced individually on two similar courses under counterbalanced experimental conditions designed to manipulate the level of anxiety experienced. The effort exerted on the driving tasks was assessed though self-report (RSME), psychophysiological measures (pupil dilation) and visual gaze data. Efficiency was measured in terms of efficiency of visual processing (search rate) and driving control (variability of wheel and accelerator pedal) indices. Driving performance was measured as the time taken to complete the course. As predicted, increased anxiety had a negative effect on processing efficiency as indexed by the self-report, pupillary response and variability of gaze data. Predicted differences due to dispositional levels of anxiety were also found in the driving control and effort data. Although both groups of drivers performed worse under the threatening condition, the performance of the high trait anxious individuals was affected to a greater extent by the anxiety manipulation than the performance of the low trait anxious drivers. The findings suggest that processing efficiency theory holds promise as a theoretical framework for examining the relationship between anxiety and performance in sport.

In this article the author will attempt to share with you the challenges currently facing the field and where possible offer his thoughts on how to deal with current problems. A major problem in the field of sport psychology is that few people understand what sport psychology is, and what sport psychologists do. For a large segment of the population the term "psychology" connotes issues related to mental health or psychopathology, and this perception is difficult to overcome. Most sport psychologists work in the normal to super-normal part of the continuum. The vast majority of young people entering the sport psychology profession want to be consultants and unfortunately want to work immediately at the highest level-professional sport.

It is considered to be one of the most popular performance enhancement techniques or psychological skills because of its versatility in effecting several different outcomes. Imagery has been referred to by a number of names--visualization, mental rehearsal, mental practice, and cognitive enactment to name a few. A brief overview shows that imagery research is diverse and can include descriptive and experimental studies using qualitative and quantitative methods. The goal of the current article is to present evidence supporting the need for the evolution of imagery research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - This paper is the second of two essays designed to acquaint English-speaking readers with the work of Avksenty Tcezarevich Puni (1898-1986), one of the fathers of Russian sport psychology. In our previous essay "The Russian origins of sport psychology: a translation of an early work of A. Tc. Puni" (Ryba, Stambulova, & Wrisberg, 2005), we discussed Puni's innovative ideas of psychological preparation of athletes based on his classic paper "Psychological preparation of athletes for a competition" that was published in 1963. In that essay, we grounded Puni's pioneering work within the specific socio-political and historical context of his era by providing a brief overview of his life (including extensive explanatory footnotes) in pre- and post-Socialist Revolution Russia. In this paper, we attempt to further historicize the work of Puni on the psychological preparation of athletes by discussing his ground-breaking model of Psychological Preparation for a Competition (PPC) and contrasting that work with the activity of sport psychology consultants taking place in North America during the same time period (i.e., 1960s and 1970s). In a concluding section, we will discuss some of the lessons sport psychology consultants have learned in the decades since Puni developed his model and suggest some ways future models might expand on Puni's view of the provision of psychological assistance for athletes.

AB - The purpose of this study was to utilize multiple perspectives to describe the major influences and experiences during the development of highly talented collegiate athletes. Eight NCAA Division I collegiate athletes, 12 parents, and 6 coaches participated in this study. In-depth semi-structured interviews analyzed through grounded theory analytic procedures (Strauss & Corbin, 1998) were used. Overall, it was ascertained that a favorable interaction between perceived genetic dispositions, practice, situational factors, and mental characteristics facilitated and nurtured the participants' talent development. The importance of social support for overcoming adversity was a salient theme and should be addressed by sport psychology consultants and coaches.

AB - Is there a relation between physical exercise and subjective well-being? The present study answered this question by conducting a questionnaire survey of senior high school students. The sample was obtained through stratified random sampling in the whole country. The country was divided into seven geographic areas from each of which seven cities were randomly selected. Within cities, schools were stratified by various factors and one school was randomly selected from each sector in the cities. Finally, one class was selected from each grade of each school. A total of 2520 questionnaires were sent out and 1968 were returned. Subjective well-being (SWB) was measured along the five dimensions of positive emotions, negative emotions, life satisfaction, study satisfaction, and physical satisfaction. These measures showed acceptable psychological properties. Factors predicting the SWB were physical self-esteem, personality, interpersonal relationship, and coping, which were measured using the Physical Self-Perception Profile and the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire. The changing of life events variables were measured using a check list of negative and positive life events. To keep a consistent set of life event variables, cases that had negative events were not included in the present study. The sample upon which the present study was based had 803 students. Results: Demographic variables such as gender and school which showed significant differences in SWB were controlled when examining the relation between physical exercise and students' SWB. Engaging in physical exercise had a significant effect on each dimension of the SWB (Wilks' = 0.956, F = 7.29, p 0.05, but duration of physical exercise did (Wilks' = 0.851, F = 10.7, p < 0.01, and the interaction between exercise intensity and duration of physical exercise also showed a significant effect (Wilks' = 0.942, F = 1.92, p < 0.05). The structural equation modeling analysis results supported the revised theoretical model of psychological mechanism, CMIN (χ2)/ df = 4.196, GFI = 0.902, AGFI = 0.857, CFI = 0.866, RMSEA = 0.078 . Conclusions: 1) SWB of senior high school students involves five perspectives, which are positive emotions, negative emotions, life satisfaction, study satisfaction and physical satisfaction. 2) The self-editing scale reflects an overview of the SWB of senior high school students and has high reliability and validity. This measurement tool can be used to study the relation between exercise and the SWB of senior high school students. It can also be used for diagnostic and clinical consultation purposes by the mental health professionals. 3) Senior high school students doing exercise have higher SWB than those not having enough exercise especially with respect to special life satisfaction. Doing physical exercise occasionally did not seem to impact students' SWB. Long-term physical exercise shows significant effects. Relatively long duration of physical exercise that is of low to medium intensity is positively related to students' SWB. 4) Physical exercise not only shows direct impact on the SWB of senior high school students but also has indirect impacts through such intervening variables as physical self-esteem, interpersonal relationship and personality.

AB - Research has shown that psychological skills training can be effective in enhancing athletes' performance and positively influencing cognitive and affective states (cf. Williams & Krone, 2001). However, to date, little work has been conducted investigating such processes with adolescent high-performing swimmers. The present study examined the effects of a seven-week psychological skills training (PST) program on competitive swimming performance and positive psychological development. Thirty-six national level swimmers (13 boys, 23 girls; M = 13.9 years old) followed a PST program for 45 minutes per week. The intervention consisted of goal setting, visualization, relaxation, concentration, and thought stopping. Performance times were obtained from official meets. Participants completed seven inventories measuring quality of performance, and six positive psychological attributes: mental toughness, hardiness, self-esteem, self-efficacy, dispositional optimism, and positive affectivity. Findings demonstrated that there was a significant post-PST program improvement in three separate swimming strokes, each over 200 m. Non-significant improvements were shown in 10 other events. There was also an overall significant improvement in participants' post-intervention positive psychological profiles. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

Since the field is in the process of development and psychologists come to this type of practice from a variety of paths, ethical issues in this type of practice bear particularly careful attention. This article reviews the primary ethical issues involved, including preparation for diversified practice; competence; interpersonal and relational issues; and presentation to the public. Currently emerging concerns are also discussed. The article concludes with specific suggestions for the practitioner interested in this field.

AB - What knowledge, skills, and values do psychologists need to consult in the performing arts? As with sport psychology, clinicians in this subspecialty often use cognitive-behavioral techniques that enhance performance. However, performing arts consultation differs in several important ways. First, because peak performance cannot be measured by a "perfect score," performing arts consultants focus on the art form's esthetic and technical requirements. Common occupational pressures, resulting in physical and mental stress, also are addressed. Finally, effective interventions are tailored to art-specific issues for each performer. The present article's intent is to encourage participation in performing arts consultation by providing basic practice information.

AB - Recent developments in social-cognitive personality theory have promising applications to sport psychology. Of special significance is Mischel and Shoda's (1995) description of the Cognitive-Affective Processing System (CAPS), a dynamic network of cognitive, affective, motivational, and behavior-generation units that interacts with situational factors to produce both coherence and cross-situational variability in behavior. Consistency in situation-behavior relations are demonstrated in individualized "behavioral signatures" of athletic coaches. The CAPS model has promise as a theoretical template within which domain-specific theoretical frameworks in sport psychology can be incorporated and expanded. To illustrate the potential utility of the CAPS model for construct elaboration, assessment of individual differences, and interventions in sport psychology, I apply it to an analysis of mental toughness and to performance anxiety, achievement goal theory, idiographic assessment, and psychological skills training. Finally, I suggest that "bottom-up" approaches to identifying causal mechanisms, exemplified by the CAPS and other social-cognitive models, can have considerable potential for theoretical, empirical, and applied advances in sport psychology.

AB - The purpose of this study was to expand our knowledge and increase our understanding of imagery use by athletes in sport-injury rehabilitation using a qualitative approach. The participants were 10 injured athletes who were receiving physiotherapy at the time they were interviewed. During the interviews, the athletes provided extensive information about their use of imagery during injury rehabilitation and it was clear that they believed imagery served cognitive, motivational and healing purposes in effectively rehabilitating an injury. Cognitive imagery was used to learn and properly perform the rehabilitation exercises. They employed motivational imagery for goal setting (e.g. imagined being fully recovered) and to enhance mental toughness, help maintain concentration and foster a positive attitude. Imagery was used to manage pain. The methods they employed for controlling pain included using imagery to practise dealing with expected pain, using imagery as a distraction, imagining the pain dispersing, and using imagery to block the pain. With respect to what they imaged (i.e. the content of their imagery), they employed both visual and kinaesthetic imagery and their images tended to be positive and accurate. It was concluded that the implementation of imagery alongside physical rehabilitation should enhance the rehabilitation experience and, therefore, facilitate the recovery rates of injured athletes. Moreover, it was recommended that those responsible for the treatment of injured athletes (e.g. medical doctors, physiotherapists) should understand the benefits of imagery in athletic injury rehabilitation, since it is these practitioners who are in the best position to encourage injured athletes to use imagery.

AB - Consulting psychologists are ideally suited to assist in the creation of healthy and life-enhancing workplaces that can increase employee productivity while promoting behaviors that reduce the risk of lifestyle disease incidence or mitigate the effects of such illnesses when already present. When psychologists integrate strategies from health psychology, these interventions can help reduce medical costs and contribute to worker productivity and morale, because these strategies are proven to decrease the incidence of the five leading lifestyle diseases: coronary heart disease, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, diabetes, and stroke. Integrating techniques from sports psychology as well results in even more effective healthy workplaces than could be achieved from using either set of techniques in isolation. Recommendations are offered for nutritional counseling, smoking cessation, stress management, and exercise initiation. Five skills from sports psychology mental training are described because they could be incorporated into psychologists' interventions for enhancing employee performance. A case study illustrates the key points. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - The potential for the occurrence of multiple-role relationships is increased when professors also consult with athletic teams on their campuses. Such multiple-role relationships have potential ethical implications that are unclear and largely unexplored, and consultants may find multiple-role relationships both difficult to deal with and unavoidable. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the nature of teacher-practitioner multiple-role relationships. Participants (N=35) were recruited from Association for the Advancement of Applied Sport Psychology (AAASP) certified consultants (CCs) who were also affiliated with a university (N=68). All participants completed a 28-item survey exploring the incidence and relevant issues pertaining to multiple-role relationships. Chi-square analyses revealed that licensed mental health practitioners (i.e., psychologists and counselors) were more likely than nonlicensed AAASP CCs to believe that multiple-role relationships were never appropriate in sport psychology, χ2(1,N= 30) = 12.80, p <.001, and to have never taken part in a multiple-role relationship, χ2(1, N= 33) = 12.44, p<.001. Independent samples t tests revealed that mental health practitioners also reported that they would have higher levels of concern for both the practitioner, r(30) = -2.77, p = .009, and the client, f(30) = -2.50, p = .018, in such a relationship.

Thirty-one volunteers of both genders, aged 10-24 years, completed a battery of positive psychological questionnaires measuring hardiness, mental toughness, self-esteem, self-efficacy, dispositional optimism, and positive affectivity. DNA samples were obtained via buccal swabs. The sample was initially split into three groups on the basis of 5-HTT genotype: SS, SL, and LL. Multivariate statistics revealed a discernible trend of a relationship between LL genotype and higher levels of positive psychological development. The nonsignificant overall effect is interpreted in terms of sample size and age of participants. The implications of these results are discussed relative to previous findings and in terms of psychological theory. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - The Unexplained Underperformance Syndrome (UPS) is characterized by a continued decrement in athletic performance, unresolved by two weeks rest (Robson, 2003). This study qualitatively examined psychological factors of potential relevance to UPS, with specific consideration of the consequences of a mentally tough attitude in the interpretation of fatigue. Seven elite athletes, clinically diagnosed with UPS or Chronic Fatigue, participated in one-to-one interviews to examine their experience of UPS. The results of this study revealed a paradoxical relationship between mental toughness and UPS. Specifically, a mentally tough attitude, deemed desirable in competitive sport, obviated physiological markers of fatigue. Furthermore, the results indicated that non-training related stressors appeared to have a pivotal influence on the onset of UPS.

The purpose of this article, describing Mike Voight's interview with Coach Pete Carroll, was to "illustrate how sport psychology-related principles and practices are used by a major college head football coach." True to his intent, Mike Voight has provided readers with an inside look into a coaching philosophy that includes self-awareness, goal setting, modeling, positive affirmations, refraining, and other psychological constructs as core strategies in creating the "mental toughness and resiliency" necessary to excel at the highest levels of collegiate sport. There is a belief among many sport psychologists that self-awareness, the cornerstone of Coach Carroll's philosophical model, leads to better sport performance.

AB - Reviews the book, Applied Exercise Psychology: A Practitioner's Guide to Improving Client Health and Fitness by Mark H. Anshel (see record 2005-13007-000). The introduction of this book focuses on the failure of disciplines that might be considered to have a stake in exercise to promote properly exercise in their clients. Specifically, the author takes to task the fitness industry, physical trainers, physicians, and educators for having failed to stimulate the use of exercise as a medium for health benefits. He faults the fitness industry as having too much interest in recruiting new customers and too little in maintaining existing ones. Anshel divides physical trainers into the competent and caring versus the poorly trained and communicatively challenged. He chides physicians and nurses as much for their own sorry physical condition as for failing to adequately serve their patients by promoting exercise as opposed to quick-fix medications. Educators, especially those involved in delivering physical education programs in schools, are viewed as more of the problem than the solution. That is, rather than tout exercise as an activity with positive and lasting health benefits, they use it all too frequently as a cudgel to discipline children's undesirable behavior. Anshel directs this book to mental health professionals, including psychologists. Anshel has made it quite simple for readers to familiarize themselves with the key theories and principles of exercise-based interventions. He has even included appendixes, which include exercise checklists, fitness tests, and basic examples on stretching. Not complete in themselves, these appendixes appear intended to provide the clinical practitioner an easy, practical entry into the scientific aspects of exercise. The reviewer's take-home message is that this book should be on every clinician's shelf. It can serve as a periodic reminder of the powerful contributions of exercise to physical and mental health and give the basic starting points for exercise interventions.

AB - Objectives: The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of Harris and Harris' (1984) concentration grid exercise, an exercise proposed to enhance concentration and visual scanning speed [Harris, D.V., & Harris, B. L. (1984). The athlete's guide to sport psychology: Mental skills for physical people. New York: Leisure Press]. Method: Twenty-eight male collegiate soccer players were assigned to either a 9-week concentration grid training condition or a control condition. Concentration grid training consisted of 9 weekly meetings with an experienced sport psychologist with practice assignments in between sessions. During the first, fifth and final weeks of the experiment all participants completed a battery of concentration tasks (a visual search task, a video observation task and a concentration grid). Results: A series of MANOVA's and ANOVA's indicated no significant interaction effects indicating that the concentration training group did not improve to a greater extent than the control group in any measure of concentration. Conclusions: The findings highlight the need for further research examining the efficacy of the concentration grid exercise using different training protocols and different dependent measures. In addition, the results also indicate support for sport psychologists who have urged caution with the use of the concentration grid exercise in applied sport psychology.

AB - Recent studies (Gould, 2001a, b; Greenleaf et al., 2001) have found that specific characteristics are required for Olympic competition. This means that a special psychological attitude must be adopted by athletes. At the same time, a close relationship between coaches and athletes is generally seen as essential in maximizing the athletes' performance, and coaches therefore play a very important role in the whole process of the athletes' psychological preparation. The general purpose of this research study was to examine coaches' perceptions of the specific needs and commitments that are required for the Olympic Games and the way in which athletes must adapt psychologically. Nine Portuguese coaches, who accompanied their athletes to the Sydney Olympic Games, participated in the study. In five cases, their athletes' results met/exceeded their expectations, while in the remaining four cases the results were lower than expected. Structured interviews were used to compile data, which was then analysed according to procedures recommended by Miles and Huberman (1984). The conclusions show that the coaches regard the Olympics as having specific characteristics that make the games unique in comparison with other international events. These factors led the athletes to react differently in relation to other major sporting events, with either positive or negative repercussions on their performance. Furthermore, a different reaction to the specific difficulties that the Olympic Games involve was seen to have been made by those athletes that performed the best and those that performed the worst.

AB - The consensus opinion is that the sideline evaluation provides critical information for making the initial diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) in athletes and for making decisions regarding readiness for an immediate return to play. It appears that the sideline evaluation is performed most appropriately by team physicians and certified athletic trainers who possess the knowledge and requisite training to evaluate the effects of other types of injuries that might accompany an MTBI. There is no consensus on the relative importance of loss of consciousness (LOC), posttraumatic amnesia (PTA), and other symptoms in assessing the severity of the injury. The existence of multiple grading scales and guidelines for returning to play will likely continue until more definitive empirical data are obtained. Most agree that a sideline evaluation of mental status should include information regarding orientation, concentration, and memory. However, there continues to be much disagreement whether these evaluations should be performed informally or with the use of standardized and empirically validated instruments. There is agreement that all athletes who are considered to have sustained an MTBI should receive a medical evaluation to determine the need for any more detailed neurological consultation or follow-up with neuroimaging (e.g., computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging), electrophysiological testing (e.g., electroencephalogram), and neuropsychological testing. No athlete should return to play until all symptoms have resolved completely. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)

AB - Out-of-school time is a recurring block of time full of discretionary opportunity, choice, and flexibility. It is the time that adolescents are awake and are not in school (i.e., weekends, school holidays, evenings, early mornings, late afternoons, and in the summertime). During adolescence, young people have a significant amount of this "free time" available to them. Out-of-school time can be either an opportunity for youth to engage in positive activities that enhance their development and foster their competencies or a time to participate in negative activities that increase their chances of yielding to social pressures to do things like engage in drug use, sex, and antisocial activities. In this chapter, youth development programs are defined as any structured learning activity offered during the out-of-school hours. They include but are not limited to sports programs, before- and after-school clubs, service clubs, faith-based organizations, 4-H Youth Development programs, Boys and Girls Club, Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, YMCA, and those sponsored by other community and/or youth-serving organizations.

AB - In this chapter, the authors review what is presently known about the application of various modalities of biofeedback in the domain of sport. Given that this is a line of inquiry and application with a fairly long history in sport psychology, the chapter importantly and appropriately places emphasis on the limitations of many of the extant studies and proposes ways to overcome them. As the chapter will evidence, the use of various sensory modalities to match or complement the skill being adjusted represents an exciting new direction. Biofeedback stands and falls, however, on the selection of the index. If the physical factor is truly causative of good performance, then the feedback offers a useful augmentation to any training program, or an effective way of evaluating traditional mental skills interventions, or even an intervention in itself.

AB - This special issue of the International Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology is a tribute to William P. Morgan and his career contributions to the field of Sport and Exercise Psychology. William P. Morgan was born in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, on March 1, 1935. While in high school, he played center and linebacker for the Cecil High Bulldogs, coached by Val Rizzo, a 2-time All-American at Villanova. Morgan left Pennsylvania on a football scholarship from Concord College in Athens, West Virginia, where he received his Bachelor of Science in Biology and Physical Education in 1957. In addition to compiling two of the seminal books in the modern history of sport psychology (Contemporary Readings in Sport Psychology. Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas, Publisher, 1970, and Ergogenic Aids and Muscular Performance. New York: Academic Press, 1972), Morgan founded Division 47, Exercise and Sport Psychology, of the American Psychological Association in 1986 and served as its first President. Morgan also played a pivotal role in the development of the influential annual review series, Exercise and Sport Sciences Reviews (ESSR). His finding that exercise training was associated with antidepressant effects represented a quantum leap for sport science from a number of perspectives, considering prior to that time the mental health outcomes of physical activity had been largely ignored.

The aim of this article is to explicate a psychology of various methods of breathing for life, health, exercise and sport. Given the abundant evidence for their value and power in various forms and contexts, breathing skills may be regarded as the original method of survival, energy control, illness prevention, health promotion and improving quality of living.

AB - When fielders catch fly balls they use geometric properties to optically maintain control over the ball. The strategy provides ongoing guidance without indicating precise positional information concerning where the ball is located in space. Here, the authors show that observers have striking misconceptions about what the motion of projectiles should look like from various perspectives and that they estimate when the physical apex of a fly ball occurs to be far later than actual, irrespective of baseball experience. Their estimations are consistent with the highest point they are looking at as the ball approaches, not with the physical apex. These findings introduce a new and robust effect in intuitive perception in which people confuse their perceptual perspective with the physical situation that they mentally represent.

AB - Cultural sport psychology reflects unique aspirations and needs stemming from race, ethnicity, gender, and geography, among other considerations. The authors in this issue all echo that cultural reconciliation offers tremendous possibility to sport psychology for researchers seeking new lines of inquiry, and practitioners seeking meaningful client-focused approaches. The present installment of Athletic Insight has been developed with research and practice in mind. There are submissions that portray Mexican culture, African-American culture, and South American Latin culture. Further, the submissions herein represent academy from Australia, the United States of America, South America, and Canada. The first contribution speaks to the areas of the dominant voice within sport psychology, the consequences of personal assumptions to applied practice, and the bridging of cultural differences for improved service delivery and education. The second contribution address practical topics including client engagement in health and sport psychology service provision, social support needs, religious differences, and communication spanning languages. The third invited contribution shares how mental training intervention builds the global self-worth and perceived life satisfaction of participants. The fourth contribution suggest future directions for cultural sport psychology researchers and practitioners. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - This review suggests that the concept of spirituality should be considered seriously within sport psychology research and consultancy. Four key areas are addressed: how spirituality may be reconciled into the athlete-centered model; the integration of spirituality and religious observances into mental skills training (MST); the relationship between spirituality and positive psychological states such as flow and peak experiences; and the role of spirituality in counseling. Recent work has acknowledged the importance of spirituality in consultancy work (Ravizza, 2002a) and religious beliefs and rituals for some athletes (Czech & Burke, in press). Despite extensive study in psychology, research of spirituality in sport psychology has been slow to emerge. Some of the reasons for this are discussed and suggestions made in relation to how this important concept can be integrated into research and consultancy work. Future research and theoretical work should focus on both performance enhancement and life-skills development. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - The aims of the present study were to investigate (1) the proportion of adolescents in each of the stages of change, (2) the differences in psychosocial factors and in physical activity between the stages, and (3) the classification accuracy using several reference criteria. A random sample of 38 schools from the Flemish community in Belgium resulted in a sample of 5931 adolescents (mean age = 14.8, range 12-18, 61% females). All adolescents completed a computerized questionnaire assessing demographic variables, physical activity, physical activity determinants and stages of change. Distribution across the stages was: precontemplation, n = 684 (11.5%); contemplation, n = 948 (16.0%); preparation, n = 818 (13.8%); action, n = 492 (8.3%); and maintenance, n = 2989 (50.4%). Analyses revealed gender and age differences (P < 0.001), with girls and older adolescents being more prevalent in the first three stages. Differences between the stages of change were related to higher levels of physical activity of different intensity and within different contexts (P < 0.001), together with more favorable psychosocial determinants related to physical activity (P < 0.001). No differences between stages were found for sedentary activities. Three subgroups of adolescents were identified based on psychosocial determinants and physical activity levels. About 71% of the adolescents placed themselves in a stage which was in accordance with their self-reported level of physical activity.

AB - The acceptance of qualitative research in applied sport psychology is growing steadily, yet there are continued calls for greater methodological diversity in this research. To this end, we offer ethnography to extend and enhance our understanding of applied sport psychology. Ethnography is aimed toward understanding the culture of a particular group from the perspective of the group members. The group culture, then, will lend insight into the behaviors, values, emotions, and mental states of group members. Ethnographers employ multiple methods to gain a comprehensive understanding of the social environment and perceptions of the members of the social group. In this paper, we discuss the epistemological and methodological foundations of ethnography. Then, using research examples related to applied sport psychology, we describe processes involved ethnographic research. Finally, we explore the issues of representation and legitimacy in ethnography. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - Two subjects participated in a 216 km ultramarathon with outside temperatures above 50°C while several physiological and psychological parameters (cognitive performance assessed by a mental calculation task and an attentional task, subjective bodily experience, and lactate level) were evaluated throughout the race. Severe stress from dehydration, sleep deprivation, and total physical exhaustion are combined in a unique manner, allowing evaluation of their effects in a range far outside that obtainable in a laboratory setting. During the race the subjects answered a questionnaire about their actual bodily experiences, underwent 8 medical examinations, and performed two cognitive tests approximately every 35 kilometers. Analysis showed cognitive performance did not decrease steadily in a simple and gradual way but reached a peak in the morning of Day 2 after a short sleeping period and then decreased. In the early morning of Day 3, in general cognitive performance exhibited the worst results but increased differentially between the subjects again in the last test 1 km before the finish line.

AB - Training theories of athletes stress that training programs should be comprised of three critical phases: preparatory, competition, and transition. Physical, technical, tactical, and psychological preparations are present in each training phase. To achieve a high level of proficiency, an effective interaction among these preparations should exist within each of the critical phases of a training program. In this article a thorough examination of the four preparations within each of the three phases is provided. It is argued that any psychological intervention introduced to elite athletes during their training should reflect the aims of each critical phase of the program, and that psychological preparation should be linked to the physical, technical, and tactical preparations of the particular training practices. The combat sport of judo was selected to demonstrate how sport psychology preparation can be effectively integrated into the physical, technical, and tactical preparations of the training program within the preparatory, competition, and transition phases.

AB - The purpose of this study was to identify sources of coaching-efficacy information to compare with those presented in the Coaching-Efficacy model (Feltz, Chase, Moritz, & Sullivan, 1999). Using a structured interview format with 12 of the coaches of high-school boys' basketball used in the Feltz et al. study, the coaches were asked to identify the information they select to form their coaching efficacy beliefs. An inductive content analysis of the sources of coaching efficacy indicated that coaches selected Player Development most often, followed by Coaches' Development, Knowledge/Preparation, Leadership Skills, Player Support, and Past Experience. These sources were found to be similar to the proposed sources in the Coaching-Efficacy model (Feltz, et al.) and previous work in self-efficacy theory (Bandura, 1977).

The five-step intervention consisted of relaxation, self-talk, goal setting, focusing, and visualization. Performance scores were obtained using scores and rankings during two consecutive competitive seasons. The OMSAT-3© was used to individually assess 11 psychological indicators (Durand-Bush, 1995). Data were recorded before the intervention and after every step of the intervention, during the course of the competitive seasons. Repeated ANOVAs as well as a practical assessment of the data were completed. The PST program appeared to be most effective on imagery skills, relaxation, activation, focusing, and refocusing. On three events out of four (bars, beam, floor), the 10 gymnasts progressed 5% more than 11 other gymnasts who did not follow this PST program.

AB - A valuable addition to the growing range of books in FIT's Sport Psychology Library series, this treatment of the application of sport psychology to basketball is presented by an eminent coach-educator, Dale Brown, and a highly experienced sport psychology researcher and practitioner, Kevin Burke. This combination of expert knowledge has been combined to provide basketball players and coaches with a very helpful guide on the role of psychology in basketball. Sport Psychology Library: Basketball focuses on the combination of fun and skill in sport. Brown and Burke emphasize throughout that playing the sport should be enjoyable. Gaining skills and knowledge to master a complex task like basketball is satisfying in itself. Sport Psychology Library: Basketball is divided into two main sections, " FUN damental Basketball" (authors' italics) and Assisting Yourself with Mental Skills. The book is a valuable addition to the applied literature on sport psychology. It extends the approach nurtured by FIT and the series editor Shane Murphy of discussing psychological principles in the specific context of major sports. This solidly grounds the concepts and will make them more meaningful for many athletes and coaches. The language used is simplified for the non-scientific audience intended and the use of a number of sports terms, such as "pre-game" and "scouting report," helps to give the structure immediate impact for these readers, as well as adding a little of the fun that Brown and Burke espouse. At the same time, this book has much from which students and practitioners in our field of sport psychology can learn. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - This article is based on a dissertation of the author that was centered on the process of developing a sport psychology program at the high school level. The program was developed to address academic, mental, social, and emotional needs of student-athletes and coaches. This sport psychology program, which was developed in the Linden Public School District, a large urban district in New Jersey, may be the first such program documented on a national level. In this dissertation, the author, who was a school psychologist in the district, utilized a particular program planning and evaluation framework, with attention to the first two phases--clarification and design--to develop and implement a sport psychology program.

AB - Preventive health psychology calls people's attention to the psychological influences of health behavior in prevention, mainly to the social influences. This is because there is a strong influence of social network on the ways of how health behaviors to be formed, especially in certain age groups as puberty. The present study has been carried out among 10-15 years old middle school children in Szeged with random schools and classes (n = 550). Self-administered questionnaire has been used as a method of data collection. The main goal of our study has been to explore the characteristics of social influences and their influence on sport activity. We have concluded that in children's environment mainly friends and classmates are physically active. Analyzing the whole sample we have experienced that parents' present and previous sport practices, sisters' and brothers', class-mates', friends' and love's physical activity have a strong, significant effect on the respondents' sport frequency. Examining the sample according to sex, we have found some significant differences. The role and effect of social influences between boys and girls were of great difference. Effect of the peer groups was significant only among girls. Analyzing sports selection, sports reason and role models we have also found significant gender differences. Research results from studies on physical activity behavior and sport should be used in prevention. In health promotion programs we should build on the role of social influences more effectively, which have a positive effect on sport frequency.

AB - A high percentage of the psychological instruments used by Portuguese researchers come from foreign countries. However, not always has the process of its cross-cultural adjustment been characterized by the necessary robustness and depth. Therefore, this paper intends to contribute to the modification of that scenery, by describing the process of the cross-cultural adjustment of Task and Ego in Sport Questionnaire (TEOSQ) for the Portuguese reality, from the translation of the original version and preparation of the Portuguese version, designated TEOSQp, to the determination of their psychometric properties through the use of the Exploratory Factorial Analysis (EFA) and of the Confirmatory Factorial Analysis (CFA), accomplished with data from different samples. The results of AFE (n = 767) and of AFC (n = 2020) revealed, in a clear way, the good psychometric properties of TEOSQp, its use being thus recommended for the evaluation of the achievement goals of Portuguese youths involved in sport contexts.

AB - Common belief has it that people go in for mountain sports expressly because they endanger life and limb of the participant, even at the individual's high level of competence to execute them. Challenging Mountain Nature reveals that, with rare exceptions, extreme sports are not at all risky in any major way; hobbyists in these fields are not, as a rule, suicidal. Nature-challenge activity involves surmounting barriers posed by the natural environment for deep fulfillment, and offers an exhilarating peak experience. Thus, this is not the language of risk, but rather it is the language of leisure and psychological flow. This book examines climber, kayaker, and snowboarder involvement in their core activities, as well as their preparation for them, the ways they relate them to noninvolved friends and relatives, and how they mold their own participation in them around personal and occupational obligations and other serious and casual leisure interests. The study also included extensive participant observation of low-, medium- and high-challenge participants in action (to the extent possible and safe for the researcher) as well as related activities.

AB - Compiled by renowned psychologist Mark Andersen, this text presents comprehensive and realistic dialogues between athletes and sport psychologists. These exchanges provide a real-world sensibility to the complex, sensitive, and even taboo topics that many other texts have not approached. The text guides readers through these situations: Understanding the dynamics of a variety of issues, including alcohol abuse and violence, referral processes, erotic transference and countertransference, and communication problems between coaches and athletes; working with diverse clients, including athletes of color, gay and lesbian athletes, and disabled athletes; presenting to and working with entire teams; plumbing the depths of several complex topics, including eating disorders and injury and identity issues. The book provides insight from an elite list of contributors who explain, using real-life examples, how they successfully and ethically "do" sport psychology. Methods that have worked for the most respected practitioners in the field are presented with an informal, engaging approach and rely substantially on dialogue and actual experiences. Part I addresses the processes of presenting sport psychology to groups, including youths and college-level teams. Part II tackles the complex issues surrounding athletes' concerns and ethical situations. The authors discuss cases that required great compassion in dealing with athletes in fragile conditions and precarious situations. Part III explores issues related to working with diverse athletes, including athletes of color, gay and lesbian athletes, and athletes with disabilities. The book covers the fundamentals and delves into off-limit and complex areas. It pushes the practice of sport psychology further than most other texts. And as it does, it will be sure to provoke debate and discussion. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(jacket)

AB - Chapter 1 begins by reviewing the literature on affect and moral behavior, with specific attention to guilt, shame, and empathy. As reported in Chapter 2, the facial components and patterns of simulated emotions were examined in 40 young adults distributed in two conditions. Laughing and weeping are thought to be one of the most remarkable behavioral expressions associated with pleasant and unpleasant emotions, respectively and are discussed in Chapter 3. In Chapter 4, after discussing a number of issues focusing on the nature of emotions, and the role of the self in emotional experience, the authors outline the propositions of self-discrepancy theory (SDT) concerning the specific emotional responses to specific types of self-evaluations and the factors that affect their self-regulatory significance. The authors of Chapter 5 propose that the personality trait of urgency, the tendency to act rashly to alleviate subjective distress, is a general risk factor for addictive behavior. To investigate how individuals recognize a sarcastic speaker's intent, two studies were conducted and are presented in Chapter 6. Through the results of recent studies, it has become apparent that linguistic and nonlinguistic information in the speech signal are not processed independently and that indexical information (at least information related to voice quality and gender) significantly affects the interpretation of the spoken message. In Chapter 7, the focus will be on one personal aspect of the speaker, namely, vocal emotion. Chapter 8 discusses how music is the ordering of tones or sounds to produce compositions with unity and continuity. Chapter 9 outlines a range of psychological skills, such as performance profiling, goal setting, mental imagery and self-talk which psychologists may use to increase perceived competence and therefore enjoyment among participants in youth sport.

AB - When watching Olympic athletes compete, viewers may wonder why athletes train so long and hard for the short time during which they put their skills to the test. What is their motivation? Some spectators may be convinced that these athletes are motivated by a hunger for fame or financial reward. Others might suggest that these athletes' motivation is self-oriented, a push to achieve a personal goal or to experience peak performance. Still others might believe that winning a gold medal for one's country is the ultimate drive. Which of these speculations is most accurate? This chapter provides some answers to this question as it examines motivation, an important topic to applied sport psychology researchers and consultants as well as to coaches and athletes. The next pages focus on situations frequently studied by researchers and encountered by consultants, coaches, and athletes when they must grapple with shifts in athletes' motivation that emerge during a season and those that can occur after significant losses. This chapter's intent is to survey theoretical models of motivation and to offer practical recommendations for increasing its positive impact on athletic performance. Dr. Brent Walker, the researcher, provides the empirical basis for the chapter as he weaves both theory and outcomes from specific studies into the recommendations. The consultant, Dr. Sandra Foster, draws on her experiences with athletes whose chosen sport demands both technical prowess and finely tuned mental skills (such as golf, figure skating, and martial arts) to illustrate the role of motivation in training persistently and competing successfully. The coach and athlete contributors, Scott Daubert, a manager of professional mountain bike teams, and DeDee Nathan, a former Olympic heptathlete, share their stories and insights throughout, giving voice to how motivation exerts its impact in real time.

AB - During training and competition, athletes can experience a broad spectrum of emotions that range from negative emotions, such as frustration and disappointment, to positive emotions, such as excitement and satisfaction. The relationships of these diverse emotions with athletic performance are complex and often counterintuitive, yet these connections have only recently begun to be explored in the sport psychology community. Emotions are clearly an important topic, because the ability of researchers and consultants to understand these interactions and the capacity for coaches and athletes to incorporate the resulting insights and tools into competitive preparation and performance determine whether emotions facilitate or interfere with athletes' performances. The purpose of this chapter is to offer readers a broad and in-depth exploration of the role that emotions play in athletic performance. The researcher (Dr. Marc Jones) integrates the latest theoretical and empirical findings about emotions in the context of the issues raised by the consultant. The consultant (Dr. Jim Taylor) describes the essential areas in which emotions influence performance based on his applied experience working with a wide range of athletes in many sports. The coach (Miyako Tanaka-Oulevey) gives her perspective on how emotions affect athletes. Last, the athlete (Mary Grigson Daubert) discusses the meaning and impact of emotions on her competitive performances. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)

AB - Enjoyment has been outlined as a strong predictor of children's and adolescents' commitment to sport. Accordingly, developing appropriate strategies to increase enjoyment among children and adolescents is an important endeavor for sport psychologists. An increase in enjoyment may lead to increased participation in sport which brings with it positive health and social benefits. To develop enjoyment among youth sport participants, it is necessary to understand what makes sport enjoyable for them. Of the many sources of sport enjoyment, perception of one's ability or competence is most significant. Thus, a valuable goal for coaches, teachers, and sport psychologists is to develop techniques to enhance children's self-perceived ability. This chapter outlines a range of psychological skills, such as performance profiling, goal setting, mental imagery and self-talk which psychologists may use to increase perceived competence and therefore enjoyment among participants in youth sport.

AB - A sport injury disrupts training and competition and challenges athletes physically and emotionally. During the recovery process, athletes experience negative emotions, such as anger and sadness, and positive feelings of optimism and hope. Typical roadblocks to successful rehabilitation include denial, pain, fear, doubt, and frustration. Education about injury and rehabilitation, goal setting, social support, and the use of mental skills are the foundations of the psychological rehabilitation of physical injury. Because the skills used in rehabilitation mimic those used in the athletic arena, athletes who learn to transfer these skills to rehabilitation recover most effectively. A small group of athletes so excel at rehabilitation that they show "remarkable recovery" and exceed their previous levels of competitive performance. This chapter presents simple and clear concepts and practical strategies for the psychological rehabilitation of injury that are grounded in applied practice, consistent with the latest research, and of value to coaches and athletes. The researcher (Dr. Edmund O'Connor) integrates the latest scientific study on the psychology of injury into the applied issues presented by the consultant. The consultant (Dr. John Heil) describes the essential psychological issues that athletes face during the course of injury rehabilitation. The certified athletic trainer (ATC, Dr. Peter Harmer) offers his perspective on the struggle to return to high-level competitive performance. In the United States, ATCs are specialists in athletic medicine and may work with a team of healthcare professionals including orthopedic physicians (MD), psychologists (PhD), physical therapists (PT), and strength and conditioning specialists (CSCS). Finally, the athlete (Iris Zimmerman) discusses the challenges of recovering from an injury. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)

AB - Writing a chapter on the application of sport psychology to athletes with disabilities is a challenge. First, there is danger that by doing so the differences between people with and without disabilities will be exaggerated. Within a sporting context, athletes are more alike than different, regardless of their intellectual, sensory, or physical capabilities. Something often missed in looking at different groups is that the variance within groups is almost always larger than the variance between groups. Second, what constitutes "a disability" is not always entirely clear. Third, the factors that may influence the development or use of mental skills, as well as the process of communication, vary depending on the disabilities involved. Nevertheless, I attempt to familiarize the reader with issues relevant to athletes with disabilities and then describe a group session for athletes with a variety of disabilities. In this group session, I hope to convey not only the considerations that may need to be made because of different disabilities but also some techniques that can be useful for group situations regardless of whether or not the participants have disabilities.

AB - Ideomotor approaches to motor control focus on the cognitive mechanisms underlying voluntary action selection. Ideomotor theory states that actions are cognitively represented in terms of their anticipated sensory consequences (response effects) and that there are bidirectional associations between movements and ensuing response effects. Accordingly, the anticipation of response effects may serve as a mental cue to activate the corresponding movement. The aim of the present paper is to describe the general principles of ideomotor theory and to review recent empirical work that supports this theory. Specifically, we describe studies on the role of response effects for the selection and initiation of simple actions and for learning and performing action sequences. Finally, we discuss potential implications of these results for sport psychology, in particular with reference to the role of motor imagery in mental practice.

To date, the majority of books devoted to the topic of performance consulting have been published by individuals with academic training in sport psychology or exercise science and deal with the provision of mental training services for elite athletes. In the book, You 're On! Consulting for Peak Performance, Kate Hays and Charles Brown offer a nice supplement to this literature by targeting the performance experiences of experts in non-sporting contexts. Their work is based on the results of extensive qualitative interviews conducted with expert performers and performance consultants in business (e.g., law, insurance, advertising, banking), high-risk professions (e.g., surgeon, police, sniper) and the performing arts (acting, music, dance, broadcasting). The result is an insightful tutorial that any practitioner interested in offering performance consultation will find quite enlightening. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - In the field of sports there is anecdotal evidence for the incorporation of athletic activity in subsequent dreams. The present study investigated dreams of sport students and psychology students with regard to sport related dream content. The findings support the continuity between frequent involvement of sport activities during the day and active participation in sport or sport themes in dreams. These findings will be discussed in the context of motor learning and REM sleep. In future research, the correlation between different performance levels for different sport activities during wakefulness and dream content should be studied in a more detailed way to generate a clearer understanding of the process of sleep-related learning.

AB - If one picks up any text in sport psychology, one will have a very hard time finding any discussion at all about diagnosis or what are the actual dynamics inside the mind of athletes. Yes indeed they will offer some suppressive techniques on how to manage anxiety, anger or lack of focus. But there will rarely if ever be commentary on typical diagnosis of athletes and the necessary psychotherapy. It's like everyone has decided to pretend that athletes have a lock on mental stability and just need a little pep talk and voila, all better. This attitude of denial and minimization prevails because the most highly visible sport psychologists are working with successful tour players. These players by definition are high functioning, which suggests that they are among those lucky few who are not suffering with excessive anxiety or personality disorders. But the vast numbers of athletes who do not make it to the tour are failing due to mental or emotional problems. And it will take more then a pep talk to cure them.

Given the special task demands of professional hockey playoffs, there are a number of areas where the sport psychology consultant can help the players and coaches deal with the mental and emotional demands of this two month marathon of games. Professional hockey players face many mental, emotional and physical challenges during their long, gruelling playoff journeys. Working with these high-profile athletes and seeing the passion that they demonstrate in working together, growing together and winning together is a very special consulting experience. Hopefully the experiences that the author have shared in this article provide some insight into the uniqueness of the professional hockey playoffs and shed light on ways that we can deliver sport psychology services to this special group of professional athletes.

AB - Presents an introduction to the "International Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology." The debate surrounding the dichotomy of two main approaches in movement science has been dominating discussions in sport psychology and movement science for more than two decades. Whereas the more ecologically oriented approach defines movement coordination in nonlinear dynamic and synergetic terms; the motor approach focuses on the motor system and, frequently, motor programs. A closer inspection, however, reveals the emergence of a class of new approaches. These new approaches have many views in common. They emphasize the goal-directedness of actions, the importance of anticipated perceptual effects, and the crucial role of mental representations in action control. Traditionally, the primary problem of motor control has to organize the correct pattern of muscular activation. The perceptual-cognitive approaches, in contrast, propose that the crucial step is constructing the appropriate mental representations, because these representations primarily govern the tuning of motor commands and muscular activity patterns. The goal of this Special Issue is to compile a selection of current work highlighting a perceptual-cognitive approach, and thus to open up a field for new perspectives and discussions.

AB - Presents a collection of abtracts on sports psychology. Some of the topics included are "Perceived Belonging in Sport Scale: Construct and Concurrent Validity." Feeling connected with significant others has long been recognized as a central aspect of human motivation. However, the construct of belonging has received little attention from sport motivation researchers apart from a description of social motives for involvement and social sources of enjoyment. In "Sensorimotor Integration During Locomotion Toward a Target in Parkinson's Disease," mMovement impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD) has typically been explained as a motor output problem. In "Explanations for Over- and Underestimating Imagined Movements," a growing body of evidence suggests that motor ideation (imagery) involves several of the same mechanisms as motor planning and execution. A common observation in studies of imagined compared to actual movement in a reaching paradigm is the tendency to overestimate. In "Neural Mechanisms and Motor Preparation," suggests that in single hand responses, reaction time (RT) is shorter when information about movement direction rather than extent is precued. In the present study hand and extent were the manipulated precue variables. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - In this study we explore the contextual and subjective determinants of flow in relation to activation in studying, and compare this with sports and watching TV or listening to the radio. 43 undergraduate students at the University of Maastricht were assessed with the Experience Sampling Method for one week (Delespaul, 1995). At random moments 10 times each day subjects evaluated the social context, activities, and mood states. Analyses were done with multilevel random regression techniques. We replicated the predicted flow-related patterns in activation and emotions. While overall activation was increased in high challenging moments, this effect was less pronounced during study. Skills levels did not affect activation. Concurrent emotions were independently and additionally related to activation. The Flow theory is a valuable model leading to predictions of optimal experience as well as activation. However, the dynamics of activity engagement are more complex and related to concurrent emotions and context. In the Dutch student culture, escaping boredom or compulsory duties seems to drive individuals more than pursuing flow. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Reviews the book, "Mistakes Worth Making: How to Turn Sports Errors Into Athletic Excellence," by Susan Halden-Brown. A unique approach to mental skills training, this book addresses the psychological challenges of sport participation through the analysis of an athlete's sporting mistakes and the use of these mistakes as a catalyst for optimizing performance. The overall goal of the author is to help athletes normalize and accept the experience of mistakes in sport, redefine mistakes as variations in performance, and work to understand the core issues related to those mistakes, therefore managing the manifestation of errors. This is a comprehensive book written in a conversational rather than academic style. Many may relate to the loose storytelling approach to addressing the topic of sport psychology. This style is, however, both a strength and weakness. It is a strength because its unabridged flow exposes the reader to a vast amount of detail hidden within the conversation. It is a weakness, however, because it camouflages some of the more important components of mistakes management. For athletes unfamiliar with mental skills, this all-inclusive style may overwhelm and dishearten a number of individuals. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Special Olympics programs provide competitive sport opportunities for athletes with intellectual disabilities. This study investigated athletes' perceptions of motivation in Special Olympics. Using Self-Determination Theory (SDT) as a guiding framework to explore athletes' experiences, 38 Special Olympians (21 males and 17 females) from British Columbia, Canada were interviewed. The data suggested that factors that enhanced autonomy, competence, and relatedness were linked to the participants' motivation in Special Olympics programs. These factors included positive feedback, choice, learning skills, demonstrating ability, friendships, social approval, and fun. Social support from significant others was a key factor related to participation motivation. There was also evidence for the motivating aspects of extrinsic rewards. Motivation was undermined primarily by conflicts with coaches and teammates. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - The goals of this study were (1) to examine the influence of visual and kinesthetic imagery on the learning of a patterned movement, (2) to compare the duration of the real movement with the duration of the imagined movement. Thirty-two subjects participated in the study. They were assigned to one of four treatment groups: a visual model-visual imagery group (VMVI), a kinesthetic model-kinesthetic imagery group (KMKI), a visual model-no imagery group (VIC), and a kinesthetic model-no imagery group (KMC). The participants had to learn to perform a graphic form accurately. Each subject realized twenty acquisition trials. Each trial was comprised of one model presentation, three mental imagery rehearsals of the model or a distractive task, according to the group, and one real performance of the form. We measured the error score for pre, post and retention (after one week) test, and the duration of imagined and real movement. The statistical analyses revealed a significant effect of imagery (visual and kinesthetic) on the performance of the graphic task; there was no significant difference between the two imagery groups in the post test, but the visual imagery group was significantly better than the kinesthetic imagery group in the retention test. The duration of the actual movement was significantly longer than the duration of the imagined movement for the two groups of imagery, but the difference between the duration of imagined and actual movement was very small in the kinesthetic imagery group.

AB - Athletes at all levels of competition run the risk of becoming injured through their sport participation, and individuals who work closely with athletes during the rehabilitation process (e.g., coaches, athletic trainers, sport psychology consultants) may be called upon to provide mental and emotional support. One approach that seems well suited as a theoretical framework for injury support is solution-focused brief counseling (SFBC). In this paper, athletes' responses to injury are outlined, and several roles of the consultant are identified. Then the basic tenets of SFBC are discussed, and an example showing how SFBC can be used in an injury support setting is provided.

AB - Reviews the book "The Psychology of Team Sports," edited by Ronnie Lidor and Keith Henschen. The main purpose of this book is to provide those professionals who are involved in team sport activities, on and off the court or field, with theoretical, and more importantly, applied guidance on how to enhance cognitive, emotional, mental, and social behaviors of players who are active in team sport activities. The book includes three parts: an introduction, empirical issues related to team sport, and "performing sport psychology" with selected team sports. Specific areas of insight included the application of the psychomotor literature in sport psychology consulting, awareness of gender issues that require specific approaches in the consultation process, and insights into the psychological issues of consulting with specific sports. The shortcoming of the book was the omission of selected literature in a book related to the psychology of team sports. The Psychology of Team Sports provides a good start in providing insight into the vast array of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral factors that influence individual and team sport performance and to promote effective interventions.

AB - This study investigated elite women athletes' experiences of flow using in-depth phenomenological interviews (Seidman, 1998). Although women have always been included in flow research, qualitative research aimed at understanding women's flow experiences in a broader life context has been absent. Research has described flow as a genderless state (Oglesby & Hill, 1993), the same for men and women. Yet, ample research in sport suggests that women's sport experiences are indeed unique. The participants were 10 female women athletes (ages 19-44 yrs.) who had competed or were currently competing in an individual sport at the Olympic, professional, or national/international amateur level. The women represented additional experiences that may occur during non-deliberative performance. Flow is also suggested as a mediating or neutralizing experience to women's objectification of their bodies (Fredrickson & Roberts, 1997). Methods used to increase trustworthiness, confirmability, and dependability of the research included prolonged engagement, peer debriefing, an independent audit, and the researcher's reflexive journal, diverse ethnicities, cultures, backgrounds and sports. Three interviews (Seidman, 1998) were conducted with each of the 10 elite female athletes. From a constant comparative analysis of the coded and themed interviews emerged a model that situated the women athletes' flow experiences in a broader context. The Paradox of Deliberateness model provides the structure for understanding the developmental process of flow that occurs throughout the sporting lives of these women. The analysis revealed three distinct athletic career pathways and two key processes that occurred as these women developed their expertise. These key processes were identified as Individual Synthesis and Transformation. Individual Synthesis occurred throughout their training and sport careers. The women actively engaged in making the training fit their unique physical and mental makeup. Transformation involved the athletes shifting from thoughtful, deliberate and structured technical and physical training efforts to a non-deliberate performance. Factors that enhanced and hindered this transformation were identified. Further research is needed to identify other factors that may influence this transformation and to describe additional experiences that may occur during non-deliberative performance. Flow is also suggested as a mediating or neutralizing experience to women's objectification of their bodies (Fredrickson & Roberts, 1997). Methods used to increase trustworthiness, confirmability, and dependability of the research included prolonged engagement, peer debriefing, an independent audit, and the researcher's reflexive journal.

AB - Is it possible that athletes' emotional states before an athletic event could affect its subsequent outcome? More generally, how do athletes manage to regulate and control their emotions before, during and after important competitive challenges? Until recently, these questions received little empirical attention from researchers either in psychology or in sport science. This neglect is probably attributable to two main factors. On the one hand, mainstream cognitive psychology has been hampered significantly by its literal interpretation of homo sapiens --the thinking species--with the result that it has underestimated emotional influences on mental processes and behavior. As a consequence, little understanding has been gained of the way in which people spontaneously experience and cope with their emotions in everyday life. On the other hand, much of sport psychology has been preoccupied with the relationship between anxiety and performance, thereby overlooking the rich variety of other emotional experiences (e.g., anger, hope and joy) available in the domain of athletic activity. As a result of this latter oversight, few theoretical attempts have been made by sport psychologists to investigate the full range of emotional experiences engendered by competitive sport. Fortunately, these twin obstacles have been overcome with the publication of Coping and Emotion in Sport . This book is both timely and significant because it not only fills a major gap in contemporary sport psychology by mapping the way in which athletes cope with their emotional experiences but also because it explores a host of potentially fruitful new avenues for future research and practice in this field. In short, it provides a valuable critical analysis of the main theories, methods and findings on the interplay between emotion and coping in sport.

AB - The main purpose of this chapter is to present the theory and empirical research on goal setting in sport and exercise environments and then to apply them to practical settings. First, a goal is defined. Second, distinctions are made between performance, process and outcome goals with particular emphasis on how much control individuals have in achieving their goals. Third, Locke's theory of goal setting is presented, its focus being that specific, difficult, challenging goals lead to higher levels of task performance than easy goals, no goals, or 'do your best' goals. Fourth, empirical research testing Locke's seminal research and theory is presented, with a particular emphasis on goal difficulty and goal specificity. Next, the focus shifts to goal setting in sport and exercise settings: the results, although not as robust as those in the industrial literature, nonetheless support the effectiveness of goal setting. The basic goal setting principles are then presented, including setting realistic and challenging goals; setting both short- and long-term goals; setting specific, measurable goals; prioritizing goals; writing goals down; providing support for goal achievement; and providing for goal evaluation. Moving from general principles, a specific goal setting system for coaches is presented, which includes preparation, education and acquisition, and evaluation phases. Although certain general principles regarding goal-setting are proposed, it is important to remember that the motivations of the specific individuals involved and the task being performed also influence the efficacy of any goal-setting program. The chapter concludes with a discussion of some of the common problems that might arise when implementing a goal setting program.

AB - Finding optimal methods for to psychologically preparing elite athletes for competition requires analyzing an analysis of the specific processes they implement as they perform. Based on course-of-action theory, the present study proposes a situated-cognition analysis of the actions of four trampolinists during the performance of 13 routines for the 1999 World Championships. Videotapes and self-confrontation interviews were used to collect data. The data analysis involved identifying (a) the elementary units of meaning (EUMs), (b) their constituents, and (c) the coherence relationships between them. Comparisons of the different courses of action revealed variations in the athletes' involvement modes during move execution. Constrained by the alternation between touching the trampoline and moving through the air, the trampolinists' mode of involvement alternated accordingly between actions aimed at changing the current situation and actions aimed at assessing the outcome of the changes made. Some ideas for improving training techniques and psychological services are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - The author, an experienced alpine mountaineer, sustained several traumatic climbing injuries over a two-year period. This article describes her multiple uses of self-hypnosis to deal with several challenges related to her returning to successful mountain climbing. She used self-hypnosis for physical healing and to enhance her motivation to resume climbing. While training for her next expedition, she successfully utilized self-hypnotic techniques to deal with acute stress and later post-traumatic symptoms that had emerged related to her climbing injuries. She describes her use of hypnotic ego-strengthening, mental rehearsal, age progression, and "Inner Strength" as well as active-alert trance states. Her successful summitting of Ecuador's Cotopaxi at 19,380 feet was facilitated by "The Hypnotic Belay" which permitted her to secure herself by self-hypnosis in addition to the rope used to secure climbers. In 1994, the author returned to the Cascade Mountains where she had been injured three years earlier and reached the summit of Mount Shuksan. This time she was secured by "The Hypnotic Belay".

AB - The purpose of this study was to examine the validity of a stages of exercise change questionnaire with self-reported exercise, age, and body mass index (BMI) in 1,034 male and female community residents. It was found that the maintenance stage participants reported more strenuous exercise than did individuals in the other stages; and participants in the action stage reported more strenuous exercise than did individuals in the preparation and contemplation stages. There were no significant group differences among participants in the preparation, contemplation, and precontemplation stages for strenuous and moderate exercise. The maintenance stage participants engaged in more moderate exercise than did the preparation, contemplation, and precontemplation individuals; and the action stage participants reported more moderate exercise than did individuals in the preparation and precontemplation stages. The participants in the maintenance stage were older than were those in the action stage. No significant stage differences were found for mild exercise or BMI. Knowing an individual's stage of exercise change may provide researchers and practitioners with a mechanism for developing, testing, and delivering stage-matched exercise interventions.

AB - The purpose of the current study was to describe how eight female national athletes of one team sport experienced the activity of a six-week centralized training camp. Specifically, the following research questions guided the study: (a) what was the process of the experience for each of these athletes and what strategies do they use to progress through the centralized camp; (b) how did the athletes experience the various contexts of their lives during the centralized camp and what strategies did they use to progress through them; and (c) how did athletes come to understand and take into account their experience? What did athletes learn from the experience? This inquiry was guided by a social constructivist perspective informed by feminist theory in sport. The eight participants were interviewed using an in-depth phenomenological approach. Each participant was taken through a series of three in-depth 90-minute interviews and asked to describe her experience at the six week centralized training camp. Analysis occurred on two levels-individual profiles and shared experiences. The findings are discussed in terms of the research questions. With respect to process of the experience and the strategies employed to progress through the camp, social and organizational factors played a fundamental role in the experience of the participants. Moreover, the coping strategies selected by the participants' were related to their cognitive appraisal of the person-environment relationship. With respect to the various contexts of their lives and the strategies employed, the participants approached the centralized training camp by taking steps to minimize the distractions from their outside world before attending the camp. Further, during the camp, participants had limited contact with individuals outside the camp environment, followed routines and activities, and sought social support from teammates to maintain and achieve their desired focus while in camp. Finally, with respect to the meaning of the experience and the lessons arising, the participants highlighted numerous issues of both a positive and negative nature. The camp meant opportunities for personal growth; mastery experiences; feelings of anger, disappointment, and failure; and questions of continued involvement in the sport. In addition, participants stressed the meaning of the centralized training camp experience with respect to the opportunities to interact and share experiences with others and develop positive friendships and memories. The findings are also discussed in terms of initiatives for educating national team athletes, coaches and organizations on preparation for, and implementation of, centralized training camps.

AB - The physical and mental health benefits of regular physical activity have been highlighted by several professional organizations. Still, a large proportion of the industrialized world's population is not regularly active. Research examining the promotion of physical activity has been a recent occurrence. In an effort to provide an outlet to synthesize and discuss future research directions the authors conceptualized the Konza Workgroup on Physical Activity Participation. The workgroup is made up of new scientists within exercise/sport psychology and behavioral medicine with an interest in contributing to the future of science related to physical activity participation. This special issue stems from the first retreat of the Konza Workgroup in 2000. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Processing efficiency theory predicts that anxiety reduces the processing capacity of working memory and has detrimental effects on performance. When tasks place little demand on working memory, the negative effects of anxiety can be avoided by increasing effort. When tasks impose a heavy demand on working memory, however, anxiety leads to decrements in efficiency and effectiveness. These presumptions were tested using a modified table tennis task that placed low (LWM) and high (HWM) demands on working memory. Cognitive anxiety was manipulated through a competitive ranking structure and prize money. 10 participants' (mean age 28.9 yrs) accuracy in hitting concentric circle targets in predetermined sequences was taken as a measure of performance effectiveness, while probe reaction time (PRT), perceived mental effort (RSME), visual search data, and arm kinematics were recorded as measures of efficiency. Anxiety had a negative effect on performance effectiveness in both LWM and HWM tasks. There was an increase in frequency of gaze and in PRT and RSME values in both tasks under high vs. low anxiety conditions, implying decrements in performance efficiency. However, participants spent more time tracking the ball in the HWM task and employed a shorter tau margin when anxious. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Participants were 83 students (36 men, mean age 23.8 yrs and 47 women, mean age 22.5 yrs). 10 intrinsic-extrinsic factors involved in sport motivation were obtained. The factors were generated from items obtained from the participants rather than items from the experimenter. Obtained motivational factors were Social Reinforcement, Fringe Benefits, Fame and Fortune, External Forces, Proving Oneself, Social Benefits, Mental Enrichment, Expression of Self, Sense of Accomplishment, and Self enhancement. Each factor was referred to an intrinsic-extrinsic dimension to describe its relative position on that dimension. The order of the factors as listed indicates increasing intrinsic motivation, i.e., the first four factors were rated in the extrinsic range, whereas the remaining six were rated to be in the intrinsic range. Next, the participants rated the extent to which each of the various factors was involved in their decision to participate in sport activities. The pattern of use of the motivational factors was the same for both sexes except that men indicated greater use of the Fringe Benefits factor. Overall, the more intrinsic a sport motivation factor was rated, the more likely it was to be rated as a factor in actual sport participation.

AB - This study examined the factors that contributed to the development and maintenance of expert athletic performance. Athletes (4 men, 6 women) having won at least 2 gold medals at separate Olympics/World Championships were interviewed using an in-depth, open-ended, semi-structured approach. Results revealed that the athletes progressed through 4 stages throughout their career: Sampling, Specializing, Investment, and Maintenance years. Common findings were that at an elite level, contextual factors included parents, coaches, teammates/friends, support staff, other athletes, and school/education. Personal characteristics pertained to self-confidence, motivation, creativity, and perseverance. Training involved technical, tactical, physical, and mental components and was influenced by quantity, quality, intensity, and recovery. Competition factors concerned meticulous planning, evaluations, dealing with pressure, expectations, and adversity, and focusing on process rather than outcome. Implications to increase the quality of experience of athletes are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Ten US Olympic champions were interviewed, as were one of their coaches, and a parent, guardian, or significant other. Athletes were characterized by: (1) The ability to cope with and control anxiety; (2) confidence; (3) mental toughness/resiliency; (4) sport intelligence; (5) the ability to focus and block distractions; (6) competitiveness; (7) a hard-work ethic; (8) the ability to set and achieve goals; (9) coachability; (10) high levels of dispositional hope; (11) optimism; and (12) adaptive perfectionism. Results also revealed that a number of individuals and institutions influenced the athletes' psychological development including the community, family, the individual himself or herself, non-sport personnel, sport environment personnel, and the sport process. Psychological characteristic findings verified current sport psychological research on psychological characteristics associated with peak performance and suggest new variables to consider. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Two studies grounded in ironic-cognitive-processing theory were conducted to determine (1) whether ironic errors may be associated with efforts to exert mental control that typically occur in sport settings and (2) whether these potential ironic effects could be negated through the use of a task-relevant cue word to refocus one's thoughts during suppression. Participants were asked to watch a videotape of a series of clips of Australian Rules Football players, coaches, and umpires. Study 1 with 102 undergraduates revealed that participants were more aware of umpires when instructed not to pay attention to them. Contrary to expectations, however, ironic effects were not significantly magnified by the combination of high cognitive load and the instruction not to pay attention to the umpires. Results from Study 2 with 64 undergraduates indicated that potential ironic effects could be negated when individuals were given a task-relevant cue word to focus on when suppressing unwanted or negative thoughts. Overall, support for ironic processing theory was found in this investigation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - This study reports the concurrent validity testing of two short-form competitive state anxiety inventories, an Immediate Anxiety Measurement Scale (IAMS) (newly devised) and the Mental Readiness Form-3 (MRF-3) with the criterion scale, the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2 (CSAI-2). Encompassing dimensions of anxiety interpretations (direction), and frequency of cognitive intrusions, the investigation attempted to alleviate the time consuming assessment of anxiety through a 1wk time-to-event paradigm. Following structured education, 82 competitive athletes completed the inventories at 5 precompetition temporal stages (1wk, 2days, 1-day, 2hrs and 30min). Relative measurement agreements and change over-time analyses indicated the IAMS displayed stronger validity than the MRF-3 especially at times close to education and competition. Results suggest athletes may be taught to recognize and report the direct constructs and dimensions of anxiety, and that the IAMS may be of use when examining anxiety states both close to and during competition.

AB - Pain, limited range of motion, and decreased strength are signs and symptoms that are commonly suffered by student-athletes following injury. However, denial, depression, anger, anxiety, and fear can also occur as a result of injury. Although most athletic trainers are well prepared to care for the physical ailments associated with injury, some are much less adept at designing rehabilitation and treatment programs aimed at addressing psychological reactions. The potential for helping athletic trainers recognize both the physical and psychological ramifications of injury begins with academic preparation. Currently, undergraduate athletic training students are expected to complete course work that addresses twenty different subject matter areas. Yet, only one of the twenty subject matter areas addresses the psychological component of health care. This apparent under-representation of psychosocial intervention in the curricular preparation of athletic trainers may not adequately address the complex nature of injury and its effect on student-athletes. A course specifically designed to address the assessment and mediation of psychological reactions to injury was offered to a group of athletic training students (N = 19). Pretest and posttest measures were taken in the form of an interview (n = 6) and a questionnaire ( N = 19) in order to determine the degree to which athletic training students' perceptions changed regarding the psychological impact of injury on student-athletes. An analysis of the pretest and posttest questionnaire results revealed that students significantly changed how they perceived the impact of sporting and social influences on the type and severity of psychological response to injury, as well as the impact injury can have on academic standing. The ability to recognize the presence of psychological reactions did not change significantly from pretest to posttest. The pretest and posttest interview results appeared to support the findings of the questionnaire. The six interviewees seemed to become more complex in their understanding of the possible psychological responses to injury and also became more empathetic practitioners. Consequently, the value of a course specifically designed to address the psychological impact of injury seems to be founded. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - This qualitative study used a phenomenological approach to investigate ice hockey, specifically the phenomena experienced by players retired from the National Hockey League (NHL) that helped them reach the NHL. Subjects were three NHL players who had retired since 1989, inclusive. Each subject was interviewed via telephone using a semi-structured format. Interviews were transcribed, coded, and analyzed into meaning units. Themes emerged from the meaning units and were grouped into the following four stages that led subjects to success in hockey: (a) Beginning the Dream; (b) Fostering the Dream; (c) Preparation for the Dream; and (d) Passing on the Dream. These stages consisted of 12 themes that facilitated a clearer understanding of phenomena that helped them succeed and reach the NHL. The Beginning the Dream stage contained no separate themes. Mentors, Support, Motivation, Passion, and Psychological Traits make up the stage of Fostering the Dream. Four themes were found in Preparation for the Dream. They were Opportunity, Talent, Coaching, and Challenges. The last stage of Passing on the Dream consisted of two themes recommendations, To Coaches, and To Players. Findings and implications for further research are discussed for each of the four stages. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - The body of this work contains three distinct pieces examining interpersonal relationships in sport contexts from an interdisciplinary perspective. Sport is a rich site for investigating interpersonal dyadic and team relationships, and with the recent emergence of a multidisciplinary "relationship science" (Berscheid, 1999), examining relationships in sport is more relevant than ever. The first purpose of this work is to illuminate the importance of examining relationship quality to determine how social agents may account for variance in developmental, mental health and psycho-social outcomes in and out of sport. The second purpose, is to hypothesize how examining "close" relationships might be relevant and useful to sport, especially in the coach-athlete dyad. The third purpose is to propose a model of the Relational Landscape of Sport by discussing implications of relationship research and empirical tool development efforts. The fourth purpose is to provide psychometric evidence supporting future development and use of the Relational Health Index-Sport (RHI-S) in measuring relational quality between the coach and athlete. Results from factor analysis, and reliability and validity testing indicate the RHI-S may be useful, but further developmental efforts are warranted. Relational quality between coach-athlete, assessed by the RHI-S, is also examined in terms of how dyadic interaction affects both coach and athlete burnout. Previous research in sport contexts has provided a foundation for understanding how coaching behaviors may influence athlete psychological outcomes, such as burnout. However, research has utilized a limited range of coaching behaviors and investigated burnout in a primarily unidirectional manner. Lastly, this work sought to extend the literature by examining burnout from a bi-directional, relational framework in which the coach and athlete mutually influence one another. Significant gender differences existed in terms of how male and female coaches experiencing varying degrees of burnout, in turn influenced athlete psychological outcomes such as mood state, satisfaction, and burnout. Male coaches experiencing burnout had more frequent and statistically significant negative influences on athlete psychological outcomes, than did female coaches. This body of work is intended to help bring sport fully "on-line" to the multidisciplinary science of relationships. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Examined associations between the extent of participation in endurance sport, and self-report data on self-image, physical and psychological health and overall lifestyle in a large representative sample of German high-school students. 988 German adolescents (47.2% males and 52.8% females, aged 14-18 yrs) were administered a series of questionnaires aimed at assessing anxiety-depression, trait addiction, smoking and drinking behavior, physical ill-health reports, and self-perception of self-image, parental acceptance and educational attainment. Regular practice of endurance exercise was related to a more favorable self-image. There was a strong association between participation in sports and the type of personality that tends to be resistant to drug and alcohol addiction. Physical exercise was further significantly related to scores for physical and psychological well-being. Adolescents who engaged regularly in physical activity were characterized by lower anxiety-depression scores, and displayed much less social behavioral inhibition than their less active counterparts. It is likely that discussion of recreational or exercise involvement may provide a useful point of entry for facilitating dialogue among adolescents about concerns relating to body image and self-esteem.

AB - This chapter covers moral development in sport and physical activity contexts. Historically, sport has been defended in terms of helping to develop moral virtues (e.g., honesty, respect, fair play) and as a training ground that generalizes to life skills. Educators, politicians, businesspersons, and the public have long extolled the benefits of sport participation for moral and social development. But many critics have countered the adage that "sport builds character" with the argument that sport develops character disorders. The trendy adage is that "sport reveals character." If this is so, what do actions in sport reveal? (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)

AB - Individuals who engage in self-handicapping arrange unfavorable circumstances for their important performances so as to maintain esteem in case of failure, or enhance esteem in case of success. A field study of 15 university swimmers and 14 wrestlers examined potential costs and benefits of this strategy. Self-reports of preparation, anxiety, performance, and flow experiences were obtained repeatedly during competitions over 4 mo. Scale scores identified athletes' predisposition to self-handicap. The higher athletes scored on trait self-handicapping, the poorer practice and nutrition they reported overall and before important events. Nonetheless, athletes' dispositional self-handicapping scores were positively related to performance and self-reports of optimal experience in competitions. Benefits associated with self-handicapping thus appeared to outweigh costs for participants in university-level competitive sport. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - It is true that many coaches use at least some of the principles of sports psychology when they coach, but the students they coach do not know the skill the coach is employing when he or she teaches. Moreover, the student does not know that they can practice the same skill the coach is using, so they can learn to apply it themselves. With a written curriculum based in science, a school supplies coaches with written goals and benchmarks so that all coaches are working toward the same goal, much the same way any other academic department functions. This is an opportunity to teach paths to good mental health. In this article, the author outlines community needs as related to sports psychology, the lifelong skills studied in sport psychology, and more specifically the skills most often needed on a team. He gives an example of a sports psychology curriculum taken from a high school systems curriculum development office within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The author discusses that ways in which implementation of this program nationally (two generations or more away) will change amateur sports in America.

AB - Self-efficacy is the confidence that one has in one's ability to do things. During the past decade, self-efficacy beliefs have received increasing attention in educational research. Research has consistently shown that academic performance is often better predicted by self-efficacy than by prior attainment indexes. By the time students reach college, pre-determined efficacy beliefs regarding their ability to solve mathematics problems have been developed. Though few efforts to improve self-efficacy beliefs have been reported in the literature, it has been noted that efforts to identify self-efficacy beliefs and alter inaccurate judgements should prove beneficial. Four sources of self-efficacy are defined in Bandura's Self-Efficacy Theory. These sources offer guidance as to how to modify self-efficacy beliefs, but do not offer specific techniques for doing so. Therefore, the researcher turned to the world of sports for the identification of such techniques. By adapting techniques from sports and sports psychology, and using the four sources of self-efficacy for guidance, the CHAMP toolkit was developed. The purpose of this study was to train three non-traditional college mathematics students in the use of CHAMP and assess the extent to which these intervention techniques enhanced mathematical self-efficacy, as well as the extent to which these students were able to both internalize these techniques and begin to use the techniques on their own. Qualitative data were collected through individual interviews, direct observations, a focus group interview, and researcher and participant journals. Changes in mathematical self-efficacy were noted throughout the study. These changes included: (1) changes in participation; (2) changes in preparation; and (3) changes in how each participant viewed word problems. Three specific areas of demonstrated internalization of CHAMP were found and discussed: (1) awareness of CHAMP techniques already being used; (2) effective use of CHAMP; and (3) the ability of each participant to teach others CHAMP. Upon internalizing CHAMP, the participants demonstrate their ability to use it on their own by applying CHAMP to a variety of other classes, both mathematics classes and non-mathematics classes, and by applying the use of CHAMP to real-life events.

AB - The purpose of this study was to examine elite athletes' experiences of confidence in sport. A qualitative research approach consisting of a semi-structured, in-depth interview format was used in order to meet the intended goal of obtaining athletes' experiences of both high and low levels of confidence as well as those influences that might affect confidence in competitive situations. Interviews were conducted with eight elite athletes from eight different sports. An inductive content analysis of the interview data identified a broad range of internal and external influences on sport confidence as well as the utilization of multiple strategies for building and maintaining confidence. The results of the study also suggest that sport confidence is multi-dimensional in nature, consisting of mental, emotional, perceptual, and behavioral components.

AB - Comments on the original article by P. Ekkekakis and S. J. Petruzzello (see record 2002-10569-001), arguing that those authors presented an inaccurate critique of the Exercise-Induced Feeling Inventory (EFI) created by the original authors (see record 1994-15885-001). In the current paper, Gauvin and Rejeski formulate a threefold rebuttal to the arguments advanced by Ekkekakis and Petruzzello. First, they identify selected misinterpretations and misconceptions in the critique that, if ignored, could jeopardise future advancements in this area. Next, they review extant research on the EFI and highlight what has been learned from 13 empirical studies with this measure over the past eight years. Finally, they outline a research agenda for overcoming what we perceive to be limitations of the EFI and for advancing knowledge on feeling state outcomes associated with involvement in physical activity. Much of the critique by Ekkekakis and Petruzzello is rhetoric rather than substance. The EFI has been useful in stimulating new research and thinking about the role of physical activity in ameliorating mental health and health-related quality of life.

AB - This paper supports the contention that the brain stores memories in the form of a central representation that is accessed by both physical preparation and execution and, more importantly, by motor imagery associated with this preparation and execution. Considerable evidence in support of shared central and vegetative structures suggests that sport psychologists should consider more closely aspects of the performer's responses to the physical skill when providing imagery interventions and not rely on "traditional," more clinically orientated, methods of delivery. It is noted that many texts provide a schedule of factors and techniques for psychologists, athletes, and coaches to consider but with a limited theoretical explanation of why these factors are the crucial concerns. The authors, therefore, propose an evidence-based, 7-point checklist that includes: physical, environmental, task, timing, learning, emotional, and perspective elements of imagery delivery highlighting the minimum requirement areas in which sport psychologists should monitor the equivalence to the physical task in order to enhance the efficacy of their practice.

AB - Demonstrated the use of a self-report exercise log and a heart-rate monitor in the measurement of adherence to the dimensions of an exercise prescription, and proposed an alternative way to define adherence to a 24-wk home-based women's walking program which reflects the dynamic process of behavior change. Adherence was measured with exercise logs, Polar Vantage XL Heart-Rate Monitors, and pre- to post-intervention change in V0/2max in a sample of 156 women (aged 45–65 yrs). Of the dimensions of the exercise prescription, frequency of walks documented by both the heart-rate monitor and the exercise log had a higher correlation than duration and intensity of walking, with change in V0/2max suggesting that frequency was potentially the most predictive adherence measure. Examination of the total number of walks and the number and sequence of weeks without walks over the 24-wk intervention revealed dynamic patterns of adherence suggesting variation in the degree of behavioral change.

It is asserted that the article is an excellent framework for psychologists and coaches who are working in the field of mental training (i.e., those who are more practically oriented). The chosen theoretical model is highly appropriate for practical situations, as person and situation characteristics are incorporated over time in a life-span approach. However, the situational component of this model gets relatively more emphasis than the personal component, in particular, regarding the assessment of "individuality".

AB - The purpose of this study was to examine the social-psychological benefits of sports and fitness identities, that is thinking of oneself in terms of one's fitness activities (e.g., as a runner, a golfer, etc.). Past research has demonstrated that exercise has a positive impact on one's physical and psychological health. However, the research has not examined how the identities associated with exercise affect one's health. This study used Identity Theory and a stress and coping perspective to examine the direct effects of holding a fitness identity as well as possible indirect effects. The indirect effects included whether or not fitness identities would buffer the effects of stressful life events on one's health, and whether the identities would lead to a greater sense of mastery and more active coping in dealing with stressful life events. The data for this study were from a two-wave prospective panel study of 532 married and divorced adults from the Indianapolis area. Face-to-face interviews were conducted in 1988 and 1990. Regression analyses were conducted to determine the direct and indirect effects of fitness identities while controlling for the amount of exercise. The results indicated that holding a fitness identity has a direct positive impact on both one's physical and mental health. However, it had no effect on mastery or the type of coping techniques one used, and it did not buffer the effect of negative life events and strains on health. The amount of exercise also had a direct effect on physical health but it did not have a direct effect on mental health. The amount of exercise had an indirect effect by buffering the effect of negative life events on mental health. These results demonstrate the importance of examining the role of fitness identities when analyzing the effects of exercise on well-being.

The applied sport psychology literature is replete with guidelines and suggestions for referring athletes for counseling or psychotherapy when appropriate, but the ethical, legal, and procedural problems associated with sport psychology consultants whose training or mental conditions suggest the need for remediation, rehabilitation, or psychotherapy, and possible removal from seeing clients, has not been addressed. The authors describe a variety of situations where student and professional functioning might be impaired, discuss the possible ramifications (legal, ethical) of impairment, and provide suggestions for ways to proceed when sport psychology consultants are in psychological difficulty.

Little attention, however, has been given to those brief interventions that occur frequently when working with athletes in the field. Such interventions are time limited, action oriented, and present focused. The purpose of this article is to provide a brief overview of the use of brief contact interventions with athletes in field settings. In particular, the authors provide a short introduction to such interventions, describe a framework for their use, and present several case examples. It is suggested that brief contact interventions can be made more effective by following the principles described in this article. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Examined whether there is overall agreement amongst professional cricketers on the factors which are most important for the occurrence of repeatable good performances in the sport. Also, the consistency of the rank-order of such variables was investigated across individuals and roles within the same sport. 198 cricketers (100 batters and 98 bowlers) who play or have played first class cricket in the English County Championship completed a rank-order task, which enabled them to use their experiences to judge the importance of 15 selected performance-influencing variables. Cultural consensus analysis indicated that no one factor for either batters or bowlers was significantly more important, despite many batters and bowlers ranking the need for 'total self-confidence' highest. Whilst no over-all agreement was found for batters and bowlers in their ranking of variables, a group of similar 'core elements' (e.g., total self-confidence, following a set prematch routine, set performance plans, optimal arousal, and using mental rehearsal) were highly ranked by both groups, which may be an important consideration for practitioners endeavoring to produce strategies that encourage more consistent and higher performance for cricketers.

AB - The present study comprised 2 meta-analyses of published studies that used the Profile of Mood States (POMS) to investigate relationships between mood and athletic achievement ( n = 13) and between mood and performance outcome ( n = 16). Results showed that effect sizes (ESs) for the level of achievement meta-analysis were minimal, a finding consistent with a previous meta-analysis by A. Rowley et al (1995). Larger effects were found for the performance outcome meta-analysis. Effects were moderate for vigor, confusion, and depression, small for anger and tension, and very small for fatigue. All effects were in the direction predicted by W. P. Morgan's (1985) Mental Health Model. Effects were larger in sports of short duration, in sports involving open skills, and where performance was judged using self-referenced criteria. Findings suggest that the POMS has utility in the prediction of performance outcome but not in the prediction of level of achievement. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - The unique experience of swimming the English Channel is a test of mind and body to overcome multiple challenges. The purpose of this study was to examine psychological characteristics and reflective meanings of these swimmers. Eight English Channel swimmers were interviewed (aged 23–72 yrs). Inductive and deductive analyses compared interviews and interpretations with the coinvestigator and swimmers. Themes included the cognitive orientations of mental toughness, while cognitive strategies included goal setting, compartmentalization of time, and/or swimming distance, and self-regulation. Descriptions of the experience of the swim included an ease of swimming at the beginning, more aversive experiences in the middle, and a paradoxical euphoria and letdown upon completion of the swim. Several swimmers noted the perception of increased occupational effectiveness, self-confidence, and an awareness of unlimited potential. Whereas, other swimmers noted a more competitive post event focus. Reflective experiences supported Maslow's notion that the meaning associated with a peak experience augments daily life.

AB - Undertakes the task of describing new approaches and recent developments in the study of performance-related emotions in sport. The book concentrates on emotion problems from the idiographic (individualized) perspective, which is becoming more and more recognized and appreciated in sport as well as other areas of applied psychology. Therefore the Individual Zones of Optimal Functioning (IZOF) model has been chosen as a major theoretical and methodological framework. Part I provides and overview of theoretical, conceptual, definitional, and general methodological foundations of the individualized approach to the study of performance-related emotions; Part II deals with the basic emotions or emotion clusters as they relate to athletic performance; Part III presents three approaches to the problem of patterns of acute and chronic emotional response to strenuous work in practices; and Part IV provides an overview of additional issues in which the role of emotion has special importance.

Results show that goal setting and positive self talk were used almost always. Music use was reported by most, both for inspiration and relaxation. The majority of Ss reported never using autohypnosis, autogenic training, blank meditation, bracing, color, cue words, mantra meditation, and Transcentental Meditation. There were no significant differences in techniques employed by sprinters vs long distance swimmers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - A case study design was used to (1) describe the process and identify the content of the verbal interactions between an eminent mental training consultant and 5 elite level athletes during 10 sessions, and to (2) compare the analyzed sessions with the consultant's published approach on mental training. The sources of information included the audio recordings of the mental training sessions, the interviews with the consultant, the interviews with the athletes, and 2 articles published by the consultant. An adapted version of the N. A. Flanders's (1965) Interaction Analysis in the Classroom was used to systematically code the process, and a content analysis was performed on the transcripts of the mental training sessions and interviews. During the sessions, the consultant's verbal behaviors accounted for 39% of the total coded behaviors leaving 60% for the athletes and 1% for silence. The content analysis showed that up to 24 topics were addressed in each session where certain issues had a more frequent word count. The analysis of the content and process showed that the consultant follows an athlete-centered approach that corresponds to the consultant's published perspective.

AB - Evaluated the effectiveness of a self-completed screening battery in identifying children involved in traumas (traffic or sporting accidents) who are suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 170 children (aged 7–18 yrs) attending a hospital accident and emergency department following everyday trauma were interviewed and completed the PTSD screening battery suggested by W. Yule and O. Udwin (1991). Diagnostic interviews confirmed that 39 Ss (22.9 %) fulfilled the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) criteria for PTSD. There were significant differences between children with and without PTSD on each individual component of the screening battery. Various criteria for caseness were evaluated and at 6 wks post trauma the screen identified up to 90% of children diagnosed with PTSD and 73% with borderline conditions. A subset of 36 children were reassessed 8 months post trauma and all children with persistent PTSD were correctly identified by initial screen scores. The limitations of the study and the role of screening for PTSD in the absence of proven psychological interventions are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - It is argued that the progress and resilience of young people in public care can be greatly enhanced by attention to the value of cultural, sporting and other activities in their lives. It is suggested that sensitive mentoring of the young person in these activities by concerned adults—members of the child's social network or volunteers—can foster the potential of the young person, build self-esteem, strengthen mental health and open new social relationships beyond the care system. A series of case illustrations are used to demonstrate how such involvement in activities can greatly improve the prospects for a more successful transition out of care. It is suggested that the potential of this neglected dimension of care can only be fully realized through alert professional practice, imaginative engagement with potential "natural" mentors, supportive agency policy, effective care planning systems, and relevant training and professional supervision for social workers.

AB - Intercollegiate athletics have been placed under intense scrutiny over the past decade. Concern has been expressed about the role and value intercollegiate athletics has in higher education. Recent scandals of intercollegiate programs and student-athletes involved in illicit or criminal activity, recruiting violations, and academic fraud or failures have increased the anxiety and skepticism. However, is the skepticism surrounding the academic integrity of intercollegiate athletics and academic achievement of student-athletes warranted? Are academics being compromised for the sake of athletics? Is the stereotypical "dumb jock" a myth or reality? Do athletes perform as well academically as nonathletes? The purpose of this study was to compare the academic achievement of student-athletes to nonathletes at the University of North Dakota (UND), a NCAA Division II institution. Also, student-athletes competing in revenue sports were compared to those in non-revenue sports. All students fisted as participating in a sport by the Office of Records and Admissions were included in the study. The student-athlete group was matched with a stratified random sample of nonathletes by gender, academic classification level, and academic college. Also, age was limited to a maximum of twenty-four years old. Cumulative College GPA was the primary measure of academic achievement. Other academic achievement factors included whether a student was placed on academic probation at some point in their college career, credit hours repeated, annual credit hours earned, and S-U courses taken. ACT composite scores were used to compare academic preparation. Overall, this study found that student-athletes' academic achievement surpassed nonathletes. Initially, no significant difference was found between the cumulative College GPAs of student-athletes and nonathletes. Furthermore, student-athletes were significantly less likely to have been placed on Academic Probation, repeated significantly less credit hours, and earned significantly more annual credits than their nonathlete counterparts. There also was no significant difference in the average number of S-U credits taken and the ACT composite scores of student-athletes and nonathletes. Finally, the cumulative college GPA of student-athletes participating in revenue sports was significantly lower than those participating in non-revenue sports. The "dumb jock" stereotype appears to be based more on myth and misconception than reality and fact. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Phone interviews were conducted with 251 suburban and rural Midwest US Ss (aged 18 yrs and older). 140 Ss who indicated they exercised 30 min at least 1 day per wk were administered a 5–7 min psychological test taken from the Personal Incentives for Exercise Questionnaire (J. L. Duda and M. K. Tappe, 1988). Results show few differences between age groups. High-activity Ss exercising > 4 days a wk have higher self confidence and seek competition and affiliation, while lower- activity Ss exercise for recognition, mental benefits and mastery.

AB - Conducted a 2-stage program evaluation of a season-long sport psychology internship. Stage 1 utilized quantitative and qualitative questionnaire responses of 12 American NCAA Division 1 women's basketball athletes (aged 18–22 yrs) and their coach (aged 36 yrs) who had a sport psychology intern as part of the coaching staff. Stage 2 consisted of follow-up personal, standardized interviews (2 mo postseason) with the coach and selected athletes (one with a receptive and one with a less receptive reaction to the role of the intern). Four substantive areas were addressed including consultant's effectiveness, the types and use of mental skills, rapport with the consultant, and an overall evaluation of the internship program. Results of the quantitative analyses suggest the consultant was perceived as effective and having excellent rapport with the athletes and the coach. Content analysis of the qualitative aspects of the questionnaire as well as the postseason interviews reveal several suggestions for a more effective internship. Results are discussed in terms of the effectiveness of the 2-stage process for the evaluation of a sport psychology internship. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - The aim of this study was to develop a discomfort questionnaire to elicit the feelings and thoughts of people engaged in running activities. Ten runners who completed a particularly demanding 9-km run were asked to express their feelings and thoughts during the run they had just completed. These responses were recorded and later used as the first pool of items ( k = 36). The questionnaire was then given to 171 runners in different distance races throughout the 1995 competitive season. These responses were analysed using exploratory factor analytic techniques and Rasch probabilistic analysis, as well as traditional reliability and validity procedures. The final version of the questionnaire consisted of 32 items divided into eight correlated subscales: proprioceptive symptoms, leg symptoms, respiratory difficulties, disorientation, dryness and heat, task completion thoughts, mental toughness, and head or stomach symptoms. These eight categories can be collapsed into three global categories suggested by researchers of pain: sensory-discriminative, motivational-affective and cognitive-evaluative. Rasch analysis suggested that the motivational-affective and cognitive-evaluative dimensions (i.e. the psychological) are the most experienced (i.e. rated highest). The eight subscales have ecological validity and were found to alter with the demands of different running distances. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - Two powerful zeitgeist forces are heavily influencing mental health professionals as we enter the new millennium. The attention to holism is one. The other is a life of practice that is in marked economic, business, and treatment flux. Practitioners can respond to this latter tension through engagement with the energy of the former. Consultation and treatment approaches that address the entirety of being human, that allow for practice diversification, and that have versatility and flexibility, are especially valuable. Using exercise in therapy is such a method. This chapter is designed to enable therapists to begin putting interest into practice. Both theory and practitioner are described. First, a number of theoretical frameworks are amenable to the addition of attention to exercise and sport psychology. Then, taking into account the practitioner's level of knowledge and skills as well as aspirations, the author offers a method for self-assessment. These topics are presented as if they were static and separate entities. However, it is the specific mixture of theoretical understanding, practitioner interest and knowledge, and clientele that informs the unique practice.

AB - Originally published in Contemporary Psychology: APA Review of Books , 1998, Vol 43(12), 877-878. Rehabilitation professionals and students will appreciate the exposure to the psychological aspects of injury rehabilitation as described in this book (see record 1997-36224-000). It stimulates an awareness that an injury happens to the whole human body and psyche. The focus is to better understand the mental and emotional components of an injury. The book focuses on the patients' psychological needs and explains how rehabilitation professionals should respond to them. This book views the entire patient, not just the physical injury. Questions about how the psychological state of the patient influences the recovery process are often not addressed in the training of rehabilitation professionals and students. This volume appears to address the need of the rehabilitational professional to understand the psychological issues involved in the rehabilitation process. Each chapter reviews a different psychological issue related to the recovery process using understandable jargon and comprehensible examples. The book is well organized, with chapters including examples and case studies that bring all of the information to real-world clinical situations in an understandable format. Finally, an emphasis of the book is on the relationship between professionals and their patients. Psychological Approaches to Sports Injury provides an approach for developing an organized psychological rehabilitation program that will complete the traditional physical rehabilitation program.

AB - The authors describe how a particular aspect of sports can nurture resiliency. They delineate principles for encouraging the development of heart (the characteristic that causes a person to be firm in his/her beliefs and to have determination to accomplish goals) in youth. By encouraging children and adolescents to go the extra mile in a sports context, youth practice calling up emotional reserves until they trust that they have a stockpile of conviction. Building heart in youth is a preventive public health strategy designed to inoculate against the potentially negative effects of stress and trauma. Accordingly, it is an essential tool in the primary prevention of stress-related disorders in youth. A case vignette of a boy "building heart" is presented.

We examined attitudes of girls (aged 10–12 yrs) without disabilities, their parents, and their coaches towards inclusion of a child with disabilities in a regular girls' fast pitch softball league. They completed the Attitudes Towards Integrated Sports Inventory prior to the season. Results suggest that players and parents had a favorable attitude towards inclusion and towards modifying the game rules to enable this player to have a safe, successful experience. Coaches were undecided about inclusion and rule modifications. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Conceptualizing injury rehabilitation as an athletic challenge illuminates the process of rehabilitation for patient and psychologist. This approach synthesizes behavioral medicine and sport psychology to create a model that identifies psychological roles for all members of the treatment team and empowers patients by a proactive approach to education and skill-building. The development of the patient-athlete mind-set is a common focus across all interventions. The patient-athlete mind-set encompasses: personal responsibility, a strong goal orientation, readiness to pursue physical training with intensity and precision, and a willingness to move one's physical and mental skills to a higher level of performance. A case example of a 35-yr-old female recreational athlete suffering chronic pain illustrates the patient-athlete metaphor. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(chapter)

Ss in the VMBR condition listened to an audiotape of progressive relaxation techniques followed by 3 mental free throw shooting exercises. Ss in the VMBR + VM condition practiced relaxation and successful mental free throw shooting and watched a videotape of a professional basketball player. Ss in the VM condition watched the videotape only. Postassessment data for free throw shooting performance was analyzed by means of a 2 (condition and ability level) by 1 (time) factor ANOVA. A significant main effect for the within Ss factor time was observed, indicating that, across the levels of condition and ability, there was a significant improvement in free throw shooting from pre- to postassessment. It is argued that a number of nonspecific factors common to each of the experimental conditions were responsible for the demonstrated improvement in free throw shooting.

AB - Sport psychology is a relatively new, rapidly developing sub discipline of mainstream psychology. This subject is primarily supported by a linear, Newtonian frame of reference. An ecosystemic epistemology is proposed as an appropriate epistemology for sport psychology. The focus of this study is a sport specific, ecosystemic model that is based specifically on the sport context in which important concepts of sport psychology are integrated. The general objective of this study is to assess South African athletes' experience of international participation using the above mentioned model. The focus is primarily on unique, dynamic transactional patterns within the athletes' broader sport context. A qualitative research method, supported by an ecosystemic epistemology, was used in this study in order to obtain, describe and explain athletes' experiences of international participation. In this alternative research paradigm, the researcher and his specific epistemology are seen as an integral part of the research process. During the analysis of data, important ecosystemic principles such as the importance of context, the existence of various realities, the interdependence of data and the identification of relationships play an important role. The descriptions by the respondents indicate that international participation exerts unique pressure on the South African athlete and his specific system. Certain conclusions are arrived at and recommendations are made in this study, specifically aimed at athletes and coaches. In terms of psychological preparation the sport psychologist who consults from an ecosystemic paradigm, is not regarded as a expert bound by specific cognitive-behavioural techniques. It is rather suggested that he, as a part of the therapeutic system, has various skills at his disposal that can be utilised on different system levels.

AB - Behavioral and cognitive techniques have played an important role in the emergence of applied sport psychology. Although evaluations of seasonal sport psychology programs have illustrated their potential for enhancing athletic performance, typical journal articles do not provide sufficient detail to make the procedures easily usable by practitioners. This paper presents cognitive and behavioral procedures applied during a seasonal psychological skills training program for young competitive figure skaters. Strategies are illustrated for (1) identifying mental skill areas in need of improvement at the beginning of the season; (2) improving practice performance during the season; and (3) increasing the likelihood that practice performance will transfer to competitions. The paper concludes with a consumer evaluation of the program by the skaters, their coaches, and their parents. The strategies described may help practitioners design effective psychological skills training programs for athletes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)

AB - There has been debate whether or not transition from sport is traumatic. The literature provided conflicting examples of former athletes who had either experienced difficult transitions or looked forward to the transition. The majority of research has focused on former male professional and elite level athletes, but very few studies focused on both male and female former collegiate athletes. A purposive sample of 5 male and 5 female former NCAA Division I athletes who had completed their eligibility was selected. Participants resided in Northern Idaho and Eastern Washington and represented several major colleges nationwide. In order to strengthen the study's credibility, 12 secondary sources chosen by the participants were also included. A semistructured 1 1/2 hour taped interview was conducted with each primary and secondary source to explore the participants' perceptions of the transition experiences. A follow-up interview several weeks later was conducted to ensure accuracy of the information. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed for themes using the Constant Comparison Method of qualitative data analysis. Major themes that emerged from the data were derived from collective perceptions of the participants regarding their sport involvement and transition experiences. These included role identity, preparation for termination, and support. The researcher incorporated these major themes into the early evolutionary stages of a data-based theory of collegiate sport transition. This information, which provides the underpinnings of a theory, suggests that athletes who had been socialized to have identities beyond that of athlete tended to prepare for the transition, set nonsport related goals, and were less emotionally involved in their athletic role. They also tended to perceive themselves as having relatively more successful transition experiences than those who have not been socialized in this way. Females reported generally more positive transitions out of sort (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of an individual mastery rehearsal audio tape on cognitive anxiety, somatic anxiety, and self confidence of NCAA Division-I swimmers. Pre-competition intensity levels were measured via the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2 (CSAI-2) (Martins et al., 1990). In addition, gender differences were also examined. A secondary purpose involved completion of follow-up questions which examined intervention group subject's opinions of their individual mastery rehearsal audio tape. Three two-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) were performed to look at differences between gender and group, as well as possible interaction between gender and group, for each subscale. All data analyses were examined using the.05 level of significance. Means, and standard deviations were run on the nine follow-up questions related to personal opinions on the intervention strategy. Twenty-four male and twenty-four female swimmers were subjects in this study (n = 48). The ANCOVA indicated no significant interaction between the intervention and gender and no significant main effect for gender. However, significant main effects were found for the intervention factor. The findings showed a significant decrease in pre-competition cognitive anxiety F (1, 47) = 7.27, p=.01, as well as a decrease in somatic anxiety F (1, 47) = 8.7, p=.005, from before to after the utilization of an individual mastery rehearsal audio tape. Additionally, after the utilization of the individual mastery rehearsal audio tape, swimmers showed significant increases in pre-competition self-confidence F (1, 47) = 10.49, p=.002. Means showed that in the opinions of the athletes, they were so satisfied with the tape, they would utilize an individual mastery rehearsal audio tape again to help enhance their potential for success. The utilization of an individual mastery rehearsal audio tape may provide an ideal method for coaches and athletes trying to address the problem of (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Physical practice alone has been the predominant method employed by coaches to enhance sport performance. The use of mental skill training in athletic competition has become more frequent and the relationship between attentional processes and sport performance has become a major focus in sport-related research. Freedom from external distracters has been shown to enhance one's ability to focus attention on task-relevant and internally generated imaginal activity (e.g., a perfect gymnastic routine). Restricted Environmental Stimulation Technique (REST) provides a comfortable environment that restricts external sensory stimulation. REST has demonstrated better performance outcomes when compared with the more widely used methods of enhancing performance in sports. On the basis of E. R. Hilgard's neo-dissociation theory and Easterbrook's cue-utilization theory of attention, this study tested the effectiveness of marksmanship practice only with practice combined with either wet flotation REST, dry flotation REST, or a relaxation condition on improving focused attention and rifle marksmanship. Student volunteers (n = 48) were enrolled in Beginning Rifle Marksmanship classes at a large northwestern university. Subjects were matched on pretest prone rifle marksmanship scores and were then randomly assigned to one of four groups (wet flotation REST, dry flotation REST, relaxation, and control). Subjects' hypnotizability was assessed utilizing the Harvard Group Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility: Form A and the Stanford Group Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale: Form C. Treatment subjects received one 50-minute session per week for two weeks. Focused attentional skills (Stroop Neuropsychological Screening Test) and unsupported prone marksmanship performance (targets) were measured prior to treatment, after treatment sessions (treatment groups only), and at a two-week follow-up. All subjects received the same instruction in marksmanship and fired the same number of practice shots. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Explored the use of approach and avoidance coping styles and task-focused and emotion-focused coping strategies in competitive sport. 421 adolescent, male athletes (aged 14–17 yrs) from New South Wales, Australia indicated their usual responses to each of 8 acute stressors commonly experienced in sport (e.g., a physical or mental error, criticism from the coach, an opponent's cheating, intense pain or injury) using a 128-item inventory. The reliability coefficient for each stressor ranged from .81 to .92. 26 of the original 128 items on the inventory were retained, on the basis of factor analysis. Correlations between stressors indicated that coping styles were a function of type of stressor, providing support for the transactional model, in which coping strategies are predicted to be a combined function of personal characteristics and situation (J. E. Singer and L. M. Davidson, 1991). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Explored the effects of a 14-wk cognitive-behavioral teaching program (CBP) vs a physical skills intervention vs no training on the motivation, preparation, and putting performance of 65 adult novice golfers. The Sport Motivation Scale was used to measure intrinsic vs introjected forms of self-regulation. Pre-putt routines and actual putting performance were measured by observer ratings. Ss completed all dependent measures prior to training and at 3 additional times over 4-wk intervals. Ss in the CBP displayed enhanced intrinsic motivation, more consistent use of pre-putt routines, and improved putting performance relative to Ss in the other 2 groups. CBP Ss also showed a significantly reduced use of introjection, which reflects a harsh, self-evaluative form of self-regulation similar to ego involvement. Cognitive-behavioral approaches seem to be effective for performance enhancement and can produce positive motivational effects. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Research has focused on how distance runners cope with the pain and discomfort that often accompany long distance running events. Much of the research has examined associative vs dissociative mental coping strategies used while running. Associative coping strategies are thought processes that focus on internal sensations such as body awareness, muscular tension, and racing strategy, whereas dissociative coping strategies shun internal sensory input due to the discomfort the input can create. This study examined 8 elite middle and long distance runners to determine whether the pace of the run would influence the associative or dissociative coping strategies used. The runners reported their thoughts and feelings immediately after running at different paces. Results suggest the purpose of a run may not be the determinant for which coping strategy is best, but that the pace of the run may determine which strategy should be used.

Triplett's (1897) study of social facilitation effects in cyclists is recognized as the 1st study on exercise, followed by a period of scattered studies till the 1970s. Periodicals had about 40 exercise publications, which were analyzed along 5 dimensions: field of study, academic unit of author, type of exercise studied, exercise paradigm, population, and topic of investigation. Exercise research has appeared both in sport/exercise and health-related periodicals, with the latter used more often by researchers in units unrelated to physical activity. Chronic and aerobic exercise were studied more often than acute and nonaerobic exercise. Exercise adherence, mental health, psychophysiological reactivity and perceived exertion were studied more than other topics. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Understanding factors which may influence the occurrence of flow in elite athletes was the goal of the present investigation. 28 elite athletes from 7 sports were interviewed about the factors they perceived influenced their experience of flow state. Inductive content analyses of athletes' responses to questions about what facilitates, prevents, and disrupts flow, resulted in 10 dimensions that synthesized 361 themes suggested by the athletes. These themes and dimensions provided insight into factors that may influence whether or not flow occurs in elite athletes. For example, some of the more salient factors influencing whether or not flow occurred included preparation, both physical and mental; confidence; focus; how the performance felt and progressed; and optimal motivation and arousal level. This study also involved asking elite athletes about the perceived controllability of these factors, and of the state of flow itself. The majority of the athletes interviewed perceived the flow state to be controllable, or potentially within their control. A large percentage of the factors seen to facilitate or prevent flow were perceived as controllable; however, factors seen as disrupting flow were largely seen as uncontrollable.

AB - Assessed the effectiveness of 4 intervention strategies in reducing competitive state anxiety among elite junior tennis players to evaluate the proposed desirability of matching type of intervention to mode of anxiety. 100 national level junior tennis players (aged 11–18 yrs) were assessed on cognitive and somatic anxiety, and self-confidence, before and after intervention. They were randomly assigned to 1 of the 4 interventions: Cognitive, comprising mental rehearsal; somatic, having 10 min of centering; cognitive and somatic, comprising centering followed by mental rehearsal; and a control condition consisting of concentration grid exercises. Results show significant reductions in preperformance somatic and cognitive anxiety, and increase in self-confidence following various interventions, including the control technique. The hypothesis of matching nature of intervention strategy to anxiety symptoms experienced, is disproved. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Compared the psychological characteristics and behavioral tendencies of 77 elite (E) and 48 non-elite (NE) male competitive Australian swimmers (aged 17–22 yrs), to develop a psychological profile for them. The extent to which Ss engaged in specific mental and physical activities was assessed by a 100 item survey, based on D. S. Kirschenbaum and D. A. Wittrock's (1984) 5-stage self-regulation (SR) model, containing questions on problem identification, commitment, execution, environmental management, and generalization. Results show that E and NE Ss differed on the commitment and execution components. E Ss used SR activities more often on selected cognitive and behavioral strategies than NE Ss. They were more self-directed, independent, and serious about their swim success. These findings confirm the use of the SR model as a valid approach for profiling the psychological characteristics and behavioral tendencies of E and NE athletes.

AB - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of varying imagery perspective and imagery time on performance of the putting stroke in golf. A series of audio tapes, developed for this research, served as the Psychological Skills Training Program (PSTP). Subjects in the experimental groups (n = 28) were from 3 introductory golf classes. The control group (n = 7) was from the general student population. Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups of 7 subjects per group. The 4 groups were: the internal perspective 3-minute imagery group; the external perspective 3-minute imagery group: the internal perspective 7-minute imagery group; and the external perspective 7-minute imagery group. The three dependent variables were: 20 scores (10 pre and posttest) on putting trials; control of visual imagery measured by the Gordon Test of Visual Imagery Control (TVIC); and vividness of mental imagery measured by the Betts Questionnaire Upon Mental Imagery Vividness (QUMIV). All groups were pre and posttested following an interval of a 6-week treatment period. All groups performed a putting activity once each week during the 6-week treatment period. The treatment subjects listened to audio tapes three times each week during the treatment period. The control group did not listen to the audio tapes. The following are conclusions based upon the hypotheses, statistical findings, limitations, and delimitations of the study: (1) The rejection of the null hypothesis of the treatment effects on Groups 2, 3, and 5 suggests that, for the 3- and 7-minute internal groups and the 7-minute external group, improvement in their putting ability is due to the treatment conditions. Group 4 (the 3-minute external group) did show improvement but not at a statistically significant level. (2) The rejection of the null hypotheses on the repeated measures pre and posttests for putting, TVIC, and QUMIV scores, for all groups including controls, suggests that improvement may have b (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Originally published in Contemporary Psychology: APA Review of Books , 1994, Vol 39(10), 973-975. Reviews the book, Psychology of Sport Injury by John Heil (see record 1993-98152-000). Heil's primary purpose is to outline a prescription for efficient injury management, but he also supplies an abundance of theory and literature review. The strengths of the book are its practicality and comprehensiveness as well as its wisdom about summoning resources on the client's behalf. To most accurately predict an athlete's response to injury, Heil advocates copious assessment using multiple sources (client interview, pain evaluation, psychological testing, and reports from the sports medicine team). To assist in this, he provides useful assessment outlines, forms, and checklists. As assessment proceeds, the injury becomes an opportunity to teach the athlete about his or her body, pain and injury, rehabilitation, and skills that foster recovery. Client education enhances goal setting and goal monitoring, the cornerstones of Heil's approach to rehabilitation. The discussion of mental training techniques, although encumbered at times by theoretical detail, covers the gamut. Leaving no stone unturned, Heil also provides specialized chapters on overtraining syndrome, the biology of pain, and medications. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Sport psychology in Spain has a short history. However, several pioneers played a major role in the international recognition of this discipline, in the foundation of the International Society of Sport Psychology, and in the organization of the 1st and 3rd World Sport Psychology Congresses. Despite that, sport psychology did not excite much interest among Spanish psychologists until the mid 1980s. There was a predominance of laboratory research on perceptual motor skills and personality during the 1960s and 1970s, followed, from 1985 onward, by work on motor development, coach assessment, and psychological preparation for competition. In the last decade, sport psychology in Spain has consolidated its status among scholars and scientists. (French abstract) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

It was hypothesized that performance in figure skating (a sport that depends on mental concentration and precision movements) would be sensitive to the effects of stress. Ss were 13 female figure skaters (aged 8–17 yrs). Stress was assessed with a child-centered inventory that listed 24 common daily hassles involving issues of personal control and interactions with family and peers, and 10 hassles related to figure skating. Perceived stress from daily hassles and skating stressors were related to increased performance problems in figure skating.

The approach task was to putt 10 golf balls along an S shaped path to reach a target hole. The avoidance task was to putt 10 golf balls into an easy target while music and noise were playing to distract Ss from the task. Ss were trained in either approach (mental rehearsal) or avoidance (attentional focus) strategies. Data support the classification of stressful transactions as requiring either an approach or an avoidance strategy. The use of the appropriate strategy enhanced perceived capability and improved performance. Stress may be conceptualized as an appraised imbalance between perceived demand and perceived capability.

AB - The goal of this work is to present a practical applied guide to the psychology of sport injury that is comprehensive, systematic, and coherent. While focused ostensibly on the sport participant, this work applies generally to anyone for whom effective performance relies on physical and mental prowess. To accomplish this, the book integrates the largely applied and anecdotal work in sport psychology with the more formal literature of behavioral medicine and sports medicine. Key principles and practices from these disciplines are synthesized and presented in a way that is relevant to the distinct needs of the athlete. In so doing, I have relied heavily on my own personal experience and the experiences shared with me by colleagues, many of whom have contributed to this text. This work is equally directed to the sport psychologist and the clinical psychologist, with the assumption that those working with athletes within either of these specialties should be prepared to treat injury. Prior knowledge of both sport psychology and clinical psychology is helpful, and readers are encouraged to cross over disciplines and extend their knowlege base . . . This book is also written for the physician and the sports medicine specialist (i.e., sport physical therapist or athletic trainer), based on the assumption that medical treatment and rehabilitation have an important psychological impact on the athlete.

The measurement considerations of such a dual role relationship are discussed, and potential ramifications of the dual role and implications for future developments in the field of sport psychology are reviewed. The issues concern the role of the sport psychologist as an educational psychologist, not as a clinical psychologist. It is recognized that there are disadvantages and potential problems when the coach also functions as the sport psychologist because coaches must be more concerned with their teams than with individual players. Players may be reticent to share mental weaknesses with their coach because they may fear that this would negatively affect their playing time.

Psychological skills include self-perceptions, motivation, positive attitude, coping with stress, and moral development. Psychological methods include environmental influences (e.g., physical practice methods, coach and parent education, communication styles, modeling) and individual control strategies in the form of goal setting, relaxation, and mental imagery.

The history of applied sport psychology is briefly noted. Empirical literature that supports the use of cognitive behavioral intervention strategies in athletic contexts is considered. This includes treatment evaluation evidence for performance improvement of nonelite sport participants and correlational evidence that supports the consideration of psychological variables in the performance of elite athletes. Intervention strategies include imagery and mental rehearsal, arousal management, goal-setting, self-instruction and self-monitoring, and multi-component treatment programs. The implications of this research for applied sport psychology and the broader field of clinical intervention are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Examined the role of acute aerobic exercise (AE) in buffering physiological responses to mental stress. 12 trained cyclists (aged 23–38 yrs) participated in 3 counterbalanced treatment conditions on separate days: attention control, light AE, and heavy AE. After 30 min of rest following each condition, Ss completed a modified Stroop task. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) revealed that reactivity was attenuated by both heavy- and light-AE. Heavy AE was more effective in reducing MAP reactivity than light AE. Systolic blood pressure (BP) during the task was significantly higher in the control and light-AE conditions, while diastolic BP was significantly higher in the control condition than during exercise. Results suggest a dose–response relationship between acute AE and the attenuation of psychophysiological reactivity during stress. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Examined the relationship between psychological states as measured by the Profile of Mood States (POMS) inventory and within-S variation in running economy (RE) in 10 moderately trained male runners (aged 20–34 yrs). Ss were monitored during treadmill running, 5 times a week for 4 wks. Tension, depression, anger, vigor, fatigue, confusion, and a total mood disturbance (TMD) score were assessed every Friday prior to the treadmill running sessions. Oxygen consumption (VO2) was correlated with the weekly TMD scores. When the focus of attention was on within-S variation, weeks featuring more economical values were associated with more positive mental health profiles. Mean VO2 correlated significantly with all the POMS subscales except fatigue. It appears that short-term fluctuations in RE of moderately trained male runners are closely tied to their mood state.

AB - This book has been structured to depict the patterns accepted by those who relate mental processes, physical behaviors, and performances to the ongoing process of human development and productivity. Written by authors from varied fields (psychology, sport medicine, exercise physiology, nursing, and education), this book provides a diversified and well-rounded approach to physical fitness. Concern has been given to the way psychology views the mind, body, and maturity, and to the psychology of personal development through the life span. Attention has been paid also to several theories of psychology which explain human behavior, particularly sport, exercise, and fitness (SEF). People with academic, professional, or simply a general interest in psychology with relation to sports and physical fitness will find this book to be of great interest.(jacket) Part I is intended to familiarize the reader with the processes of scientific psychology that are used in relating the discipline to sport[,] exercise and fitness (SEF). (It describes the part theories play in forming frameworks from which to quantify empirical SEF research, and the application of research data to behavioral, emotional, and cognitive changes.) Particular concern has been given to the way psychology views mind, body, and maturity. Part II, Growing and Maturing, has been structured to emphasize the various facets of SEF on the developing individual. Chapters covering a multitude of psychological and psychobiological areas are written toward the understanding of the role of SEF on the developing person from fetus to aging. The topics that have been chosen are representations of those that appear most growth relevant in the psychology of personal development through the life span. Part III is, in the main, concerned with several theories of psychology which are used to explain human behavior, and for this book especially, SEF. Psychodynamic theory, radical behaviorism, motivation, trait, and physiological theories are used to examine SEF concepts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(preface)

AB - This review argues that investigations of imagery effects in sports psychology literature have been unnecessarily restricted by conceptualizations of imagery in terms of just mental practice or of performance rehearsal. The paper describes the findings of sport psychology literature on the effects of imagery in performance and discusses some of the problems of existing research literature. Alternative imagery models for sport psychology are explored including A. Ahsen's (1971) triple code (ISM) model of imagery and P. J. Lang's (see record 1978-27897-001) information processing model of imagery. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - To find out whether a relationship exists between dance experience and imagery ability, 20 experienced and 20 novice female dancers (aged 18–30 yrs) completed 4 questionnaires. They included the Scale for the Appraisal of Movement Satisfaction (B. Nelson and D. Allen, 1970); the Movement Imagery Questionnaire; the Individual Differences Questionnaire; and the Stumpfs Cube Test. In 3 of the imagery tests (body image, cognitive imagery, and spatial imagery) the experienced dancer clearly differed, and in 1 measure (movement imagery) there was no significant difference. Results suggest that dance experience is related to the development of the body image, visual-spatial ability, and a tendency to process visual and verbal information on more equal terms.

AB - Examined emergency psychiatric presentations in Edinburgh, Scotland, around the time of the World Cup football (soccer) competitions in 1978, 1982, and 1986 when Scotland participated. Intervening years acted as controls. Reductions in emergency psychiatric presentations to the hospital occurred during and after the finals of the World Cup, an effect evident in women as well as men, and more marked among the mentally ill than those who were not. Increases in numbers of schizophrenic and neurotic men presenting before and alcoholic men during the competitions can be attributed to the football. The generalized reductions during and after could reflect an indirect effect on help seeking, although actual relapse rates of mental illnesses might be affected. These changes could arise from enhancement of national identity and cohesion. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Proposes 5 key factors that contribute to success in cognitive sport: technique, physical condition, psychological state, nutrition, and equipment. At the highest level, competitive pressures are as much psychological as physical, although attempts to describe the ideal personality for a competitive athlete have failed. Recognition of females as sporting celebrities has generated interest in the so-called fear of success phenomenon, while some evidence suggests that fear of success may be increasing among males. Players and coaches need to be aware that mood changes can be reflected in performance outcome and that precompetition mood can be used as one of several selection criteria. Mood measurement can help to monitor staleness and overtraining, producing a similar pattern to that illustrated among premenstrual syndrome sufferers. The sport psychologist can contribute positively to the attainment of goals that performers and coaches set, and psychological techniques can facilitate the preparation of high-ability sport performers.

AB - The fourth volume in a series sponsored by the European Science Foundation Network on Longitudinal Studies on Individual Development, the book presents in its first section general overviews on successful aging from psychological, sociological, and medical perspectives. The volume's second part focuses on selected areas of human functioning, such as intelligence, memory, athletics, life satisfaction, personal control, coping with illness and loss, widowhood, and mental health. The volume begins with a treatment of the definition of good or successful aging. From a behavioral science perspective, the definition of successful aging entails a joint focus on objective and subjective indicators of behavior and the mind. Exemplary criterion measures are indicators of life satisfaction, cognitive efficacy, flexibility of adjustment, a sense of personal control, and social competence. From a medical or public health viewpoint, successful aging consists of optimizing life expectancy while at the same time minimizing physical, psychological, and social morbidity. Accordingly, successful aging requires that the onset of infirmity occur at a later age, so that morbidity is compressed into a shorter period. Current behavioral and social research shows physical, cognitive, and behavioral plasticity in the elderly, strong associations between life-style and health, increasingly healthy life-styles on a national basis, and at least up to the eighth decade of life a decreasing age-specific incidence of chronic disease. Throughout the volume, longitudinal data are examined with regard to various questions: For example, what are the characteristics of individuals who manage best? What are their strategies of coping and mastery? How do they maximize gains and vitality while minimizing the losses resulting from increased biological vulnerability? The authors of the various chapters share in the view that aging is not identical with fate, but that individuals play a major role in designing their own process of aging.

AB - The study of stress in sport is of great interest both to academics researching and teaching sports science, and to professionals who support and train sports performers. This book firstly conveys an understanding of the ways in which stress affects performance in competitive sports, and examines the cognitive mechanisms underlying these effects. Secondly, it evaluates methods for dealing with the stresses surrounding sports performance—it considers the effects of goal setting on achievement and the effectiveness of combined, multimodal techniques for managing stress effects. It also evaluates the methods of cognitive behavioural therapy in the context of sports anxiety, and deals with the sometimes odd but effective routines that athletes tend to develop in preparation for performance. Finally, interviews with selected elite sports performers help to confirm the basic soundness of the concepts chosen to explain performance under stress. The editors, together with their team of European and North American contributors, have taken great pains to ensure that the links between sound theory and good practice are always evident thereby making this volume a valuable addition to the literature of sport psychology.

AB - What are the questions and concerns that the sport psychologist must address? What answers can psychology supply, and what is the foundation for current knowledge and practice in sport psychology? This critical and evaluative review of sport psychology focuses on key areas like motivation, personality, learning and aggression. The authors begin by identifying the major concerns of sport coaches and participants, and then examine the relevance of psychological concepts and research to these concerns. The book concludes with a powerful analysis of the problems and practice of sport psychology and its contribution to sport and well-being. All sport psychologists, athletes and coaches who have some knowledge of psychological processes and concepts, will want to benefit from the arguments and judgements presented in this book. Many psychologists will be interested in this thoughtful analysis of the application and relevance of psychology to the field of sport.(cover) Each chapter in this book (except Chapter 1) is set up in the following way: first, a number of typical questions raised by participants and coaches in the field of sport at all levels are signalled and superficially addressed within the context of the chapter heading. This is followed by a discussion of the psychological concepts pertinent to the answering of such questions (the 'pure' approach) and a selection of empirical findings stemming from the field of general and/or sport psychology (the 'applied' approach) are presented and discussed in the context of the questions posed. Each chapter concludes with an evaluation of the present state of affairs with respect to the topic area being discussed as well as speculation about future possibilities.

To describe the qualities and psychological skills of top officials; 3. To discuss the psychological skills—relaxation, concentration, imagery, confidence, communication, goal-setting—that will help you reach your full officiating potential; 4. To inform you of the specific techniques, strategies, and programs that will develop your psychological skills; 5. To demonstrate that effective psychological skills will bring you both better performance and greater enjoyment as an official. "Psychology of Officiating" is based on both research and experience. Much of the data comes straight from studies of officials, and many of the psychological principles described were developed with other sport participants. We also interviewed many officials and have incorporated their ideas and insights about the mental side of successful officiating.

Several theoretical frameworks (e.g., behavioral, cognitive, humanistic, group dynamics, and insight oriented) are incorporated. Factors contributing to the success of the program include (1) being willing to commit a major amount of time to a single sport; (2) providing a broad range of services (i.e., mental skills training, crises intervention, and injury prevention); and (3) attending to organizational issues and program evaluation.

Ss were 52 gifted athletes (aged 14–17 yrs) from objective sports (i.e., sports where outcome is determined by measurable performance) and subjective sports (i.e., sports where outcome is determined by judging). Using M. Patton's (1984) method for analyzing qualitative responses, 4 categories of causal attributions were identified: psychological preparation, physical training, environmental factors, and opponents. Psychological preparation was the most cited reason for success or failure. (French, Spanish, German & Italian abstracts) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Describes the historical developments, current activity, and future directions in sport psychology (SPP) in the US. Sport psychologists in a number of countries attempting to initiate personal activities and services or to create societies have frequently turned to US publications and consultants. The US may impact other countries in the following ways: (1) the formation of academic programs to prepare sport psychologists, (2) the directional focus of the research, (3) professional views, and (4) development of programs and services with regard to athletes, coaches, organizations, and education. Recommended guidelines for the preparation of sport psychologists are provided. Considering the recency of meaningful developments and the observations that there are relatively few scholars and professionals fully dedicating themselves to working in SPP, there should be optimism about developments in recent years and in the years to come.

Ss tended to show increases in heart rate when imagining scenes with which they had personal experience and which would involve cardiovascular activation if experienced in real life. Nonsignificant heart rate changes were found when the scene involved activation but was one with which Ss did not have personal experience. Results are discussed in terms of P. J. Lang's (see record 1981-00036-001) bio-informational theory of emotional imagery. It is suggested that the theory has implications for imagery rehearsal in sport psychology and can account for a variety of findings in the mental practice literature.

AB - Studied hunter retrieval of wounded deer as a case study of developing a research orientation for the management of recreational behavior. The behavior of retrieving wounded deer was viewed as a stimulus–response element in a sequence of shooting and related activities. 457 archery and 143 firearms hunters responded to a mailed questionnaire to estimate wounding and retrieval rates. Archery hunters retrieved 43% of the deer they had wounded, and gun hunters retrieved 81% of the deer they had wounded. Data about retrieval practices were used to generate suggestions about reducing deer wounding rates. Retrieval depended on the nature of the shot, the site, and hunt preparations. Modifications of all these factors have implications for improving retrieval rates. It is contended that early appetitive behaviors may prove easier to modify than later "consummatory" behaviors.

Physical education literature on mental practice is reviewed, and a recent form of imagery rehearsal, visual motor behavior rehearsal (VMBR), that has been used with Olympic team training is described. Research validating VMBR outcomes and studies examining its principles are noted. The basic concepts from sport psychology practice are summarized, including the importance of determining the exact content of the imagery actually used by the athlete in the rehearsal, individualization of the rehearsal, training in transfer of skills, and the development of adaptive skills for coping with the unexpected. Implications of this sports performance data for behavior therapy practice are discussed. (38 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Analyzes the stress or stimuli that create a panic attack resembling a psychiatric disturbance. Stress as an element of fear may originate from physical, psychosocial, or biological factors. The reaction to stress is characterized by modified behavior and parallel biological cardiovascular, pulmonary, and musculoskeletal changes. If too intense, these modifications cause a panic attack with possible severe anxiety and depression symptoms. Mental confusion and denial of reality usually result in a diagnosis of an athlete "needing rest" and tranquilizers (benzodiazepine) are usually prescribed. Research indicates that other therapies such as biofeedback and cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy may be more suitable interventions.

The Self-Handicapping Scale was administered to all Ss 2 wks prior to the beginning of competition and field observation. In Study 1, 27 university swim team members completed a questionnaire on the day prior to the meet for all 11 competitions of the season. The coach made an evaluation of practice effort and attitudes and performance during the meet for each S. An independent measure of practice attendance was kept. Results show that high self-handicapping Ss withheld practice effort relative to low self-handicappers prior to competitions that posed a threat to self-esteem. In Study 2, 32 professional golfers completed a questionnaire on the day of the 1st round of each of 13 tournaments. Results confirm the findings of Study 1. Ss did not utilize health problems as self-handicapping strategies. High self-handicappers did not decrease their preparation for an important event but did not increase their preparation to the same extent as low self-handicappers.

AB - Discusses the physical, psychological, educational, and social dimensions of healthy recreation for adolescents. It is argued that too often concern about the health of adolescents is only expressed when the evidence of illness is plainly obvious—historically, for example, the spread of contagious disease that could have been prevented by immunization, or more recently the incidence of sports injuries, the occurrence of drug and solvent abuse, or the consequences of alcoholic excesses. Examining contemporary leisure activities and detecting any latent (or emerging) hazards to health is proposed as an alternative, so that preventive action might be undertaken. Recreational activity and leisure time is not only a luxury to be enjoyed by some, but is an inevitable part of modern life in the developed world. Thus, recreation should be looked on as a part of occupational health, which needs further research, legislative protection, and appropriate instruction and guidance.

AB - Tested the hypothesis that cognitive preparation improves the endurance of athletes. 10 male undergraduate athletes were randomly placed in the experimental group and were issued a self-induced relaxation procedure (SIRP) designed to develop psychological momentum over 1 mo. The SIRP consisted of the development of relaxation and imagery and of self-induced relaxation. The remaining 10 Ss were placed in the control group and were not issued the SIRP. Strength and endurance were measured by the amount of completed intervals of 3 tasks: bar-dips, sit-ups, and pull-ups. Results strongly support the hypothesis. It was found that the development of psychological momentum significantly improved the strength and endurance of athletes in terms of completed intervals of each task.

After the 1970's the use of psychological methods in competitive sports spread widely. The purposes of the application of psychology to sports are to secure the mental health of the participants; to improve sport performance; and to select, limit, and guide the influences on the participants. The most widely used psychotherapeutic methods in sports are relaxation techniques, desensitization procedures, cognitive therapy, behavioral modification, and group dynamics. Questions concerning ethics, methods of presentation, and specialization are considered. (24 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Investigated the effects of preexisting and manipulated self-efficacy on competitive motor performance with 46 male and 46 female college students. Ss were classified as being high or low in preexisting self-efficacy on leg-strength before the experiment began and were randomly assigned to either a high- or low-manipulated self-efficacy condition in a 2–3 (sex by self-efficacy by manipulated efficacy) design. Efficacy was manipulated by having Ss compete against a confederate on a muscular leg-endurance task where the confederate was said to be either a varsity track athlete (low-manipulated self-efficacy) or an individual who had knee surgery (high-manipulated self-efficacy). The experiment was rigged so that Ss lost in competition on the 2 muscular leg-endurance task trials they performed. A questionnaire on mental attitude was completed after the task. Both preexisting and manipulated self-efficacy significantly influenced performance, with preexisting self-efficacy influencing performance only on Trial 1 and manipulated self-efficacy only on Trial 2.

AB - Administered the Life Event Scale for Adolescents (LES-A), which was used to obtain data on events that had occurred during the previous year, to 114 high school football players. Injuries during the season were classified according to the National Athletic Injury/Illness Reporting System. Findings indicate that players who experienced more family instability, particularly parental illnesses, separations, divorces, and deaths, were more likely to sustain a significant injury. It is postulated that a player's mental or emotional state may increase his risk of injury. (10 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Reports an attempt to define theoretically "psychological momentum" and empirically demonstrate its influence. Psychological momentum is defined as an added or gained psychological power that changes interpersonal perceptions and influences an individual's mental and physical performance. It was hypothesized that when 2 persons compete against each other, the competitor who has psychological momentum is more likely to win. However, if neither competitor has psychological momentum the probability of winning is equal for both. Archival data used in testing this hypothesis were obtained from a competitive racquetball tournament with 25 female and 74 male participants at various skill levels. Results support the hypothesis. It was also found that the overall positive effect of psychological momentum was greater for male than female competitors. This effect, however, seemed to be mediated by the amount of competitors' experience—the influence decreased as men's competitive experience increased and as women's experience decreased.

AB - Compared data from 3 investigations of top gymnasts and concluded that the psychical changes during the achievement of physical fitness do not always correspond with the psychical capabilities that are necessary for fruitful participation in an athletic competition. The psychical capabilities that develop in gymnasts during the achievement of physical fitness depend on the peculiarities of their motor activity, and were studied by comparing gymnasts with other athletes. The psychical capabilities necessary for participation in competition were named "psychical fitness" and were validated through some corresponding behaviors in competition. It was found that psychical fitness can develop consciously through the application of a specific approach, which is termed the "psychical preparation of the athletes."

AB - Collected data on spatial ability and throwing accuracy of 67 14-15 yr old white boys to study the relationship of spatial skills to an important component of man's early hunting ability. Previous studies have indicated a connection between spatial abilities and an X-linked recessive trait in Caucasians. In this study, age was not found to be significant in spatial or accuracy scores in the Primary Mental Abilities Spatial tests and in several measurements taken by having the Ss throw a baseball at a concentric target. A regression analysis performed to assess extent to which Spatial scores were a predictor of throwing performance indicated a relationship between the degree of vertical deviation on the target and Spatial scores. This can be tentatively interpreted as relating spatial skills to hunting abilities. (18 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Placed 5 profoundly retarded children (2 male and 3 female) in single sex groups of 2, 3, and 4 in a room containing a tubular steel play apparatus designed to elicit play behavior in young children. The free play activity was monitored via a heart rate telemetry system. Data were continuously recorded during play sessions lasting up to 2 hrs. The data were analyzed (a) to ascertain whether average activity level was susceptible to manipulation by variation of selected parameters (group size and sex), and (b) to test for the existence of periodic components (biorhythms) in the Ss' free play. There were no significant differences due to sex or to playgroup size. Power spectra of the play sessions produced a variety of biorhythms with no clear bandwidths indicated. A white noise test supported the hypothesis that frequencies faster than 15 min/cycle were noise. Frequencies slower than 15 min/cycle indicated no clear periodic components with respect to levels of group size or sex. The spectra indicated a great deal of random (noise) behavior. Results are discussed with respect to current diagnosis of hyperactivity. (23 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Investigated the relationship between viewing televised contact sports (hockey, football, boxing, and wrestling) and the manifestation of aggressive behavior, as part of a larger longitudinal study of the development of aggression. Data were gathered from an entire 3rd-grade population of 875 children. 10 yrs later data were collected from a subsample of 211 males and 216 females who could be located. At both times aggression was measured by a peer nomination technique. In the 2nd study, various self-ratings of aggression were also obtained in conjunction with information pertaining to the amount of contact sports watched. Peer nominations and self-ratings of aggression were related significantly to amount of viewed televised contact sports, but only for females. This finding as well as the absence of such a relationship for males was attributed to differences in child-rearing and socialization practices applied to males and females. (15 ref.)

Reactions were indicated on a 3-point rating scale. Results indicate that employment-oriented workers were above CA 25, married, had specific training for their jobs, had a Calvinist religious orientation, and represented rural areas. In general, male workers were more employment-oriented than females, although no difference was apparent between the sexes above CA 31. Employment orientation was found to be greater in situations where Ss could express themselves, see chances for promotion, and have desirable social contacts. Combinations of mental and physical work produced more employment orientation than either type of work alone. When chances for personal development were absent, the r between employment orientation and income faded. The "machine-regulated" Ss under CA 35 were more leisure-oriented.

AB - The therapeutic vacation community is based on M. Jones' concept of the therapeutic community and Foulkes' concepts of group analysis. This combination is set in the context of 4-wk therapy group trips to a vacation resort. It requires (a) free and unorganized communal living without daily schedules and without regulation of cooperation; (b) lodging as much as possible in 1- and 2-bed rooms; (c) a many-faceted offering of sport activities and recreational possibilities and contacts; (d) natural, nonauthoritarian and noncompulsive behavior on the part of the therapist; (e) absence of preferential treatment by the therapist; and (f) equalization of patient and therapist in terms of responsibility for his own sense of well-being. The therapeutic vacation community consists of 3 systems which interact and are interdependent. Central are the nightly therapy sessions. Around these are the day-to-day conditions of living with the other community participants. Finally, there is the environment at large to which the group member relates himself during the vacation. The criteria for selecting participants include motivation, ability to cooperate, and experience in psychotherapy groups. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB - Analyzes the social gathering known as "a party" as it occurs in the collective society of a kibbutz. The kibbutz is, of necessity, group-oriented "holding the overriding value of group experience as a basic tenet, of almost mystic intensity." Self-control and conformity are basic to the maintaining of this cultural structure. Social get-togethers on an informal level are composed of persons of about the same age, with chairs arranged in a circle, and conversation of a group, rather than personal, nature. This is not the fear of rejection of extrusion known to cocktail party attendants in the United States, but there is joking, sexual humor, and group regulation of behavior limits. The party is thus seen as a social microcosm reflecting cultural values and norms of the society as a whole. (18 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Standard administration of Cattell and Stanford-Binet tests to 28 mongoloid children provided data statistically used to develop a 2/3 shorter test. The short and standard versions were then administered to a new sample of 31 retarded children. Correlation between the short and standard tests was .97. The average administration time for standard testing was 60 min. compared to 16 min. for the short form. Vineland scores and standardized psychiatric ratings developed correlations beyond the .001 level of confidence with the short form.

The athletes scored significantly higher on the EPI Extraversion scale and on several 16 PF scales (e.g., those reflecting emotional stability, assertiveness, group dependence, and placidity). These traits are opposite to those associated with mental disorder, suggesting that sports participation and mental health are interrelated. Within-group comparisons of athletes' scores show that performance level and participation in individual vs. collective sports had no significant effect. (Russian summary) (27 ref.)

AB - Studied the features of voluntary effort connected with surmounting the feeling of fatigue. Experiments with 55 Ss when doing mental and motor (speed and force) work were conducted in natural and laboratory conditions. Goals, different in their magnitude and in their way of being formulated, were set before S, the process of goal fulfillment and the quantity of the work done being traced out. Results suggest that a specific role in surmounting the difficulties connected with going through fatigue is played by goal reflex and by the relation between goal-reflex activity and the operant image which is leading the performance. Operant image effectiveness in overcoming the difficulties connected with the feeling of fatigue depends on the situation of the image with rich informational contents, the self-evaluation of S's own capacities being an important part of it.

Swedish girl swimmers showed higher socioeconomic status and better psychological adjustment than nonathletes. Functions involving strength have improved more than those involving endurance. The CNS seems most important in setting sports records. Good athletes are most successful socially, show more leadership, and good mental health. Distinctions between capacity and ability, motor learning and performance are noted. Relation of disease, nutrition, mortality, economics, climate, and altitude to athletic performance are considered. (35 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

In sports that require precisely defined tasks in changing performances (weight-lifting, high jump, pole-vault, etc.) the duration of concentration is changed depending on the difficulty of the task. In other sports where performance is not precisely defined (i.e. penalty throw in basketball) the duration of concentration is relatively stable, and becomes prolonged with an increase of relative difficulty of the activity. The better the athlete is prepared the shorter the time of preliminary concentration. Very strong emotional excitement, bad health, etc. may disturb this regulation of concentration.

AB - We call the work by which we make our daily bread our vocation. There is much more to life, however, than just making a living. It is what we do with our leisure time that will count most in determining whether we are merely making a living, or actually making a life worth living. There are a number of important factors in making a life that might be mentioned, but it will be possible to suggest only a few. The starting point for real living is making a home. Giving freely of one's time in community service is a most satisfactory way to enrich one's life. It is important for one to have a hobby to keep well balanced. Planning for a home of one's own, performing the duties of citizenship and community service, and having a hobby or avocation--are all means of making one's life worth the living. There is another factor which contributes to complete living that should be mentioned. It is the necessity of having an ideal for which to strive. Such an ideal may take different forms, some of which are briefly discussed. One ideal to strive for is freeing people's minds from ignorance, prejudice, and intolerance. In order to serve the cause of the freedom of the mind it is necessary for one to have broadmindedness, tolerance, and love of truth. One reason for making careful preparation for a vocation is that we may have economic freedom; that is, be independent of others in the matter of provision for food, clothing, shelter, and other necessities of life. To think, however, of our own economic freedom alone is rather selfish. While working to insure one's own economic freedom it is both possible and desirable to think, plan, and work for the ideal of economic freedom for all. The person who is really free and truly happy is the person who is not dependent upon things. In order to make the best of life it is important to know how to find satisfaction in thoughts and feelings, which have their origin in the realm of the spirit.

AB - In the normal individual thinking is never entirely divorced from action. In abnormal conditions, however, particularly in introversion, thought is abused at the expense of action. In the ecstasies, a special form of introversion, thought becomes mere play; it is the exploitation of easy triumphs through the reduction of action. Janet refers to his theory of psychic energy in explaining the cause of the ecstatic state. Ecstatic crises come about through a weakening of this energy. The ecstasy has two main characteristics. In the first place, there is arrest of primary action by a reaction of complete success; everything is beautiful, there are no troubles, no worries. Secondly, there is a waste of energy mobilized for the primary action and freed by its arrest. All ecstasies seem to have a great quantity of apparent energy at their disposal. In an ecstasy the individual has enough psychic energy to enjoy phantasy. In certain cases, the ecstasy may be a defense, a saving up of energy to be used later.

The author considers the results of imitation from the point of view of the society as a whole rather than from that of the development of the individual. Further, he notes the importance of the play tendency. He argues that play, athletic contests, and games of all sorts exert among us an important influence in moulding individuals, preparing them for social life, for co-operation, for submission, for leadership, and for the postponement of individuals to collective ends. Finally, the author discusses habit--the tendency for all mental processes to become facilitated by repetition, the tendency to the formation of repetitions of thought and action which became more and more fixed in the individual as he grows older; and the consequent preference, increasing greatly in each individual with advancing age, for the familiar and the dislike of all that is novel in more than a very moderate degree.

By inner imitation, the spectators themselves participate in the game and at the some time give unrestrained expression to their emotions. Certain existing theories have been criticized.

AB - Unlike traditional high school athletic teams, Unified Sports teams are designed to immerse students with intellectual disabilities in a facet of school culture that has largely eluded them. Nationwide, more than 2,000 schools in 42 states have the teams, where the ideal is for about half the athletes on each team to be students with intellectual disabilities, such as Down syndrome, and the rest partner athletes who play alongside them. Unified Sports was created by the Special Olympics more than 20 years ago, but the program has had a recent surge in popularity, the organization reports, in part because of a broader effort to foster an inclusive culture that extends beyond the gymnasium or the playing field called Project Unify. Since that program was established in 2008, the U.S. Department of Education has devoted more than $30 million to it. About 22,000 students across the country are involved in Unified Sports teams, and Special Olympics estimates that 20 times that number have been touched in some way by the program's offshoots.

In Studie I wurden der Kenntnisstand von 340 schweizerischen Sportlern und 45 Trainern über psychologische Trainingsformen im Sport sowie ihre Erfahrungen mit solchen Trainingsprogrammen erhoben. Es ergaben sich Hinweise auf einen eher geringen Bekanntheitsgrad. Gleichzeitig bestand großes Interesse an psychologischen Trainingsprogrammen. In Studie II wurde die Verwendung des Mentalen Trainings bei 16 schweizerischen Spitzensportlern analysiert. Es zeigte sich, dass alle Sportler das Mentale Training regelmäßig anwendeten. Dabei bestanden jedoch große individuelle Unterschiede hinsichtlich der Intensität der Beschäftigung mit dem Mentalen Training.

AB - Ausgehend von einer Einführung in grundlegende Aspekte von motorischen Lernverläufen und Lernphasenmodellen werden empirische Befunde und praktische Anwendungen zum Lehren und Lernen sportmotorischer Fertigkeiten dargestellt. Dabei werden die Erkenntnisse zu den Lehr- bzw. Lernverfahren nach dem Grad der Einflussnahme durch den Lehrenden geordnet. Im Einzelnen wird auf folgende Bereiche eingegangen: (1) kognitive Lehrverfahren, bei denen der Lehrende die Bewegungsfertigkeiten demonstriert (observatives Training) bzw. Bewegungsvorstellungen durch verbale Instruktionen (verbomotorisches Training, Aufmerksamkeitsfokussierung) oder durch angeleitetes mentales Training vermittelt, (2) Verfahren, die auf Fehlerkorrektur und auf Rückmeldungen hinsichtlich des Bewegungsresultats (Knowledge of Results) oder der Bewegungsausführung (Knowledge of Performance) basieren, (3) Strukturierung des sportmotorischen Lernprozesses durch die Vorgabe geeigneter Übungsbedingungen und methodischer Reihungen (etwa Einführung von Übungserleichterungen zu Beginn des motorischen Lernens, Veränderungen des Umfangs, der Abfolge und der Frequenz von Übungsvariationen und der Übungsfrequenz. Die Summe der langfristig vom Lernenden gesammelten Übungserfahrungen - unter Umständen unabhängig von der Einflussnahme durch Lehrende - wird abschließend anhand der Befunde des Experten-Novizen-Paradigmas (Deliberate Practice) behandelt.

AB - Mit dem Hinweis auf die Relevanz psychischer Faktoren für sportliche Höchstleistungen wird ein Überblick über sportpsychologische Trainingsmethoden zur Optimierung der individuellen mentalen Fähigkeiten von Athleten sowie der Teamarbeit im Mannschaftssport gegeben. Als Techniken zur Förderung der mentalen Stärke von Sportlern werden das mentale Training (Visualisierung von Bewegungsabläufen), das Entscheidungstraining zur Verbesserung taktischer Entschlüsse in schwierigen Wettkampfsituationen, das Training der Aufmerksamkeitskontrolle (Fokussierung auf die sportliche Aufgabe), das Training der Aktivierungskontrolle (Förderung der Fähigkeit zur willkürlichen Modulierung eines optimalen Aktivierungszustandes) und das Training positiver Selbstgespräche angeführt. Diese Ansätze zielen darauf ab, dass Sportler auch unter Wettkampfbedingungen ihr Potenzial vollständig abrufen können. Mit dem Ziel, den Teamgeist zu stärken und die Gruppenkohäsion zu verbessern, werden folgende Methoden eingesetzt: Coaching des Trainers, Teamentwicklung, Einzelberatungen von Athleten. Abschließende Bemerkungen betreffen das Phänomen des Heimvorteils der mit dem Konzept der Selbstwirksamkeitserwartung in Verbindung gebracht wird.

AB - Ausgehend vom Expertiseansatz und dem daraus abgeleiteten "deliberate practice"-Ansatz und mithilfe des Informationsverarbeitungsansatzes wird die Bedeutung von Instruktion, Übung und Feedback im Rahmen der Entwicklung sportmotorischer Höchstleistungen erörtert. In Bezug auf Instruktion wird eingegangen einerseits auf Demonstration und verbale Instruktion und andererseits auf Probleme expliziter Aufmerksamkeitslenkung. In Bezug auf die Übung werden folgende Aspekte thematisiert: Stabilisierung der sportlichen Technik durch Übungsvariabilität, die Spezifität des Übens, mentales Training und Üben unter Drucksituationen. In Bezug auf Feedback werden Prinzipien des Feedbacks, das Videofeedback sowie das komplexe Messplatztraining besprochen. Es wird resümiert, dass sich aus der Motorikforschung zwar einige Hinweise ableiten lassen, durch welche Maßnahmen die im deliberate practice-Ansatz geforderten gut strukturierten und angemessenen Trainingsbedingungen erreicht werden können, dass es aber letztlich die schwierige Aufgabe jeder Trainerin oder jedes Trainers bleibt, diese Möglichkeiten situations-, aufgaben- und personenabhängig einzusetzen.

AB - Les modèles cliniques du système psychique et les modèles robotiques de pensée artificielle présentent des analogies qui permettent de les rapprocher. Ces rencontres facilitent l'étude des sauts entre les diverses organisations psychiques. En effet, ces sauts sont aisément observables en clinique courante. Il s'agit de données banales d'observation (les diverses organisations), d'outils les reflétant (échelle et module systémal), de sauts naturels dans les troubles mentaux (passages évolutifs de troubles mentaux, structuration des troubles, intégration des différents niveaux d'organisation), et de sauts intrinsèques au système dans la formation du processus de signification. En miroir, la robotique souligne les principes propres à un système de pensée artificielle: structuration interne du système, relations au monde extérieur et autocontrôle, données qui s'inscrivent en analogies étroites avec les données cliniques. Ses réalisations offrent en outre une structuration efficace de ces sauts qui en permet une meilleure compréhension. De ces rapprochements résulte l'intérêt d'une modélisation en trois niveaux coactifs et indissociables: biologique, sémantique et langagier, la prise en compte d'espaces et de facteurs régulateurs, l'affinement d'outils de pensée (notamment l'intuition et les matrices de connaissance logique), ainsi qu'une meilleure saisie des phénomènes pathologiques.

AB - The objective of the study was to determine the prevalence of eating disorders and risk factors for their development in female athletes. Two hundred and eighty-three elite sportswomen, competing in 20 different sports, were administered the EAT, the CETCA (the Eating Disorders Assessment Questionnaire, based on DSM-III-R diagnostic criteria), and two other inventories which evaluated 1) the possible influence on eating disorders of exposure of the body in public and 2) pressure from coaches regarding eating habits, weight, physical appearance and performance. More than 11% of subjects had scores above the cut-off point (>30) on the EAT questionnaire, a proportion similar to that found in a general female population in Spain. On the basis of the CETCA score, AN was putatively diagnosed in 2.5% of the sample, and BN in 20.1 %. Though some of these cases may have been EDNOS (eating disorders not otherwise specified), the proportion of athletes suffering from some kind of eating disorder was five times higher than in the general population (22.6% vs. 4.1%). No differences were found between the sports-women and the general population in terms of specific risk behaviours and attitudes, but a substantial subgroup of athletes presented two or more of these risk behaviours. Exposure of the body in public seems to be a risk factor for eating disorders in general, and pressure from coaches seems to be a risk factor for bulimia.

Différents types d'excellence corporelle peuvent ainsi être privilégiés à partir de cette même notion. Les promoteurs d'exercices physiques permettant d'atteindre la forme entre dès lors en concurrence, ce qui entraîne d'importants conflits. Les différentes prises de position sont explicitées à partir d'une tentative de modélisation de l'espace.

AB - Cette recherche peut être qualifiée de «psychodidactique». Elle contribue à l'affinement des contenus d'enseignement du rugby en milieu scolaire et universitaire. Visant l'enrichissement interne de la «pédagogie des modèles de décisions tactiques», elle mobilise l'utilisation croisée d'une discipline outil, la psychologie, au service d'une discipline objet, la didactique d'une APS. S'appuyant sur des éléments théoriques issus de cette étude croisée et d'investigations pré ou quasi expérimentales dans des sites réels d'enseignement, elle met en évidence le fonctionnement d'un système de représentations/actions. La notion de représentation est alors envisagée selon trois acceptions principales: cognitive, sociale et fonctionnelle. Cette mise en relation de la pensée sur et dans l'action, et des actions de jeu directement observables, offre des pistes aux enseignants d'EPS concernant des modes d'entrée différenciés dans l'activité, et la recherche des formes efficaces de transmission des savoirs «rugbystiques»

La perspective éducative et préventive est privilégiée dans cette perspective qui permet à l'athlète de développer ses ressources pour mieux s'adapter aux contraintes du sport de haut niveau. Lentraînement mental repose sur quatre habiletés de base qui sont, ensuite, utilisées seules ou combinées pour s'adapter aux besoins spécifiques des athlètes: relaxation, gestion des objectifs, imagerie, dialogue interne. Les recherches effectuées dans ce domaine montrent à quelles conditions cet entraînement mental peut être efficace.

AB - Objectifs - Étudier l'effet de la diminution de la durée de préparation sur la performance, à travers les processus d'activation et de représentation mentale chez le lanceur de poids, la durée de préparation réglementaire au lancer de poids étant passée progressivement de deux à une minute. Matériels et méthodes - Dix sujets (cinq experts, cinq débutants) ont effectué 14 jets (sept sans élan avec préparation dans le cadre de la minute réglementaire, sept sans préparation avec exigence de lancer immédiat) et sept jets par imagerie mentale. La résistance cutanée, indice des variations de l'activation, était enregistrée en continu. Résultats - Les performances avec ou sans préparation sont comparables, quelle que soit la population. La diminution de la résistance cutanée montre que tous les sujets s'activent et parviennent à un niveau d'éveil physiologique identique, quelle que soit la durée qui leur est accordée. Celui-ci est obtenu plus rapidement pour les lancers immédiats. La part qui revient à l'activation dans la performance est donc comparable avec ou sans préparation préalable. Conclusions - Pour les deux populations, l'imagerie mentale ne reproduit pas la structure temporelle de l'exécution réelle: la représentation mentale sous-estime sa durée. Le sujet ne parvient pas à s'activer autant quand il pratique l'imagerie que lorsqu'il sait qu'il va lancer effectivement.

AB - Background Special Olympics provides sporting opportunities for people with intellectual disabilities (ID), and Lions Clubs International Opening Eyes GB offers vision screening for athletes at Special Olympics Games. Methods Opening Eyes GB screened the vision of 505 UK athletes at its inaugural event in 2001. The results were analysed and are presented here. Results Results showed that athletes do not differ from other people with ID in being at high risk of ocular and visual defects and many are not accessing eyecare. I5% reported never having an optometric eye examination, and yet I9% of these athletes had a significant refractive error, 32% had ocular anomalies and 6% were visually impaired. Overall, findings confirmed the high prevalence of refractive errors and strabismus amongst people with ID. 40% of athletes had ocular abnormalities, including I5.6% with blepharitis, a readily treatable condition that causes discomfort. 9% had lens opacities, of which half were probably impairing sight. An important finding was that many athletes have reduced vision and I4% could be classified as visually impaired (WHO definition) even when refractive errors were fully corrected. Conclusions Special Olympics athletes should be encouraged to have regular eye examinations (as indeed, should all people with ID), and educators, carers and coaches need appropriate information about the visual status of their charges.

AB - Affirmative action is a problematic, but common, organizational approach to redressing gender discrimination as it fails to address discourses underlying organizational definitions and practices in highly masculinized sites like English football. Unstructured interviews with 27 key personnel and participants in coach education in the north of England within a regional "division" of the organization regulating English football ("The FA") were conducted to explore the gendered construction and enactment of football and coaching, and the framing of women-only (separatist) coaching courses. Critical discourse analysis identified the deployment of discourses concerning the undermining of standards and the privileging of women as strategies used to neutralize the significance of gender and previous gender discrimination, while re/producing the centrality of masculinity for key definitions and identities.

AB - Does manipulating the time available to image executing a sensorimotor skill impact subsequent skill execution outcomes in a similar manner as manipulating execution time itself? Novice and skilled golfers performed a series of imaged golf putts followed by a series of actual golf putts under instructions that emphasized either speeded or nonspeeded imaging/putting execution. Novices putted less accurately (i.e., higher putting error score) following either putting or imagery instructions in which speed was stressed. Skilled golfers showed the opposite pattern. Although more time available to execute a skill enhances novice performance, this extra time harms the proceduralized skill of experts. Manipulating either actual execution time or imagined execution time produces this differential impact on novice and skilled performance outcomes. These results are discussed in terms of the functional equivalence between imagery and action and expertise differences in the attentional control structures governing complex sensorimotor skill execution.

L'analyse des indicateurs langagiers, issus des discours d'entraîneurs, précédant une compétition sportive, permet de relever des effets liés aux aspects, aussi bien catégoriels que fonctionnels de cette compétition. Ainsi, dans une situation de compétition sportive plutôt favorable à l'équipe, le discours ne vise pas à accentuer la différenciation intergroupe, mais reflète aussi les stratégies de jeu. Au contraire, en situation difficile ou incertaine, le discours reflète beaucoup plus les effets classiques de la catégorisation sociale: effet d'assimilation et dévalorisation de l'exogroupe.

AB - Les investissements physiques des retraités sont directement liés à la représentation de soi et sont sous-tendus par des valeurs plurielles alors que celles-ci sont souvent considérées comme uniformes. Avoir exercé un métier manuel ou non-manuel, résider en milieu rural ou en zone urbaine, être un homme ou une femme, influencent le rapport aux pratiques et jouent sur l'image de soi. La situation de confrontation aux jeunes sportifs (adversaire / partenaire ou éducateur) modifie le rapport au corps du retraité, soit en atténuant la sensation de vieillir soit en la renforçant. Dans tous les cas, les pratiques sportives à la retraite procèdent de la résistance à la reproduction du modèle traditionnel de la vieillesse.

AB - The authors review studies of mentally simulated movements. In automatic or cyclical movements, actual and motor imagery (MI) durations are similar. When athletes simulate only dynamic phases of movement or perform MI just before competing, however, environmental and time constraints lead to an underestimation of actual duration. Conversely, complex attention-demanding movements take longer to image. Finally, participants can modify the speed of MI voluntarily when they receive specific instructions. To complete the available data, the authors compared imagined and actual durations in tennis and gymnastics. Results showed systematic and disproportionate overestimation of actual duration. The authors found a relationship between complex motor skills and MI duration. They discuss the factors leading to over- and underestimation and the hypotheses that could be tested.

Dans cette perspective, il est apparu intéressant d'étudier les attitudes et les motivations des sujets sportifs vis-à-vis des boissons alcoolisées. L'enquête, réalisée à l'aide d'un questionnaire, a porté sur 450 sujets âgés de plus de 20 ans pratiquant régulièrement le sport dans huit clubs sélectionnés de la région lilloise (Nord). Les résultats montrent que la représentation de l'alcool et de l'alcoolisation et les modalités de la consommation d'alcool retrouvées chez les sujets sportifs ne diffèrent en rien de celles de la population générale

AB - Bien que mené dans la spécialité «Physiologie du mouvement», ce travail se situe au carrefour de plusieurs disciplines dont la biomécanique, la psychologie cognitive mais aussi la didactique des Activités Physique et Sportives. Cette recherche vise à mettre en évidence la nécessité de transformer ou de construire des représentations pertinentes au regard de l'action pour améliorer et accélérer le processus d'apprentissage. Elle est le fruit d'un questionnement provenant d'une activité de terrain (professeurs d'Education Physique et Sportive, entraîneurs). Elle a donc pour autre objectif de contribuer à l'augmentation des connaissances relatives aux pratiques professionnelles de l'enseignement et de l'entraînement. Pour cette raison, l'expérimentation décrite s'est déroulée en milieu scolaire, avec des classes d'élèves de seconde et dans le cadre de l'horaire officiel. L'étude a visé plus particulièrement les habiletés tactiques utilisées lors de matchs de volley-ball opposant deux équipes de deux joueurs. L'analyse a requis la construction d'outils originaux (questionnaire, décryptage vidéo des séquences de jeu) permettant d'inférer la nature des représentations initiales (début du cycle d'enseignement en volley-ball) et finales (fin du cycle d'enseignement). La mise en relation des éléments théoriques issus de différents champs scientifiques et des observations faites lors de l'analyse des données permet de proposer un schéma de fonctionnement des représentations. Elle permet également de préciser la nature et le rôle des représentations dans le cadre de l'apprentissage d'habiletés tactiques. La discussion aborde notamment les rapports entretenus entre les représentations à caractère analogique (représentations visuelles) et les représentations à caractère plus abstrait (les concepts) ainsi que le passage de l'un à l'autre. Le concept d'image mentale d'action est particulièrement abordé.

AB - The purpose of this investigation was to measure the association between leisure time physical activity and health status, mental health and depression. The participants were women aged 18-45. The data were collected using questionnaires that were mailed to 1200 women. The response rate was 55%. The questionnaire contained three instruments: the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), the Health Questionnaire for Adults, and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The results showed that 52.8% of the sample were physically inactive. Physically active women experienced better mental health (P < 0.05), less depression (P<0.05) and they had better general health status (P<0.005). Differences in the emotional state (GHQ score) and depression (BDI score) between active (participating in exercise 3 or 1-2 times a week) and inactive women were significant (P<0.05). Even a low level of physical activity (1-2 times per week) was positively related to women's mental health (P < 0.05).

AB - In two retroactive interference experiments, we assessed the effect of mentally imagined movement speed on subsequent motor performance. All participants performed a sequential motor action at three speeds during a baseline test and a retention test. During the retention interval of Experiment 1, the participants (n = 50) physically performed the action at a slow speed, physically performed it at a fast speed, imagined it at a slow speed, imagined it at a fast speed, or performed a no-practice control task. In Experiment 2, the participants (n = 24) imagined the movement, overtly vocalized words, or both, all at a slow speed. The results revealed that the speed of the imagined motor action affected the speed of subsequent performance in the retention test and that imagery and physical practice were functionally equivalent. The results are consistent with Lang's bio-informational theory.

AB - L'article a pour objet l'analyse des représentations de l'activité des femmes dirigeantes dans les fédérations sportives françaises. Il s'agit, dans le contexte contemporain de ces organisations marqué par la coexistence de deux formes contradictoires de légitimité de leur management (hiérarchique versus participatif), de rendre compte de la construction du champ des possibles managériaux des femmes dirigeantes. En analysant la façon dont les acteurs (5 dirigeantes, 4 collaboratrices et 9 collaborateurs) de deux fédérations perçoivent et qualifient les dispositions féminines, il s'agit de montrer comment les attributs féminins (et masculins) perçus sont traduits dans le langage des compétences managériales. L'analyse montre que les frontières du légitime et de l'illégitime agir managérial au féminin se déplacent de façon ambivalente. En effet, si, d'un côté, on assiste à une ouverture d'espaces de légitimité inédits pour l'exercice féminin des fonctions de direction, de l'autre, on constate une permanence des représentations de la division sexuelle de l'exercice du pouvoir qui limitent l'engagement des femmes dirigeantes aux seuls postes fonctionnels ou techniques.

AB - This paper studies the anticipatory nature of perception in relation to subjects' expertise in basketball. The two experiments conducted showed that experts encode game situations by automatically building a representation of the next-likely state of the observed scene. In Experiment 1, subjects had to quickly compare pairs of configurations presented in succession. The results indicated that expert subjects differentiated the second configuration from the first less accurately and more slowly when the second configuration was the next-likely state of the first, than when it was a possible previous state. In Experiment 2, subjects had to study game configurations and then perform a recognition task. The results showed that experts more often falsely recognized new configurations when they were the next-likely state of an already-encoded configuration than when they represented a possible previous state. Based on these results, we discuss the nature of expert knowledge, the integration of anticipatory components in perceptual processes, and the impact of expert knowledge on visual-scene encoding and memorization.

AB - The aim of this study was to assess objectivèly the processes of mental rehearsing (imagery) by measuring variations of the autonomic nervous system (or ANS responses) during an open-ended complex motor skill in two actual experiments (volleyball) and during mental rehearsing taking place between them. Comparison between pre- and post-test (volleyball) scores related to imagining and non-imagining performances revealed significant improvement in the former (x<sup>2</sup> = 20.9, P < 0.00001) while in the latter x<sup>2</sup> = 27, P < 0.9, NS. The ANS parameters (skin potential and resistance, skin temperature and heat clearance, instantaneous heart rate and respiratory frequency) were quantified by original techniques and indices. Results from a principal component analysis showed a strong correlation between the responses in actual tasks (pre- and post-test volleyball) and during mental imagery, since the same preferential variables appeared on the main axis in 87% of cases. Thus the same autonomic channels seemed to be used during the actual activity and during the mental imagery of this activity. So far as phasic results were concerned, the main finding was a differing development of skill between imagining and non-imagining volleyball players. No clear difference was seen between pre- and post-tests in non-imaginers, except an increase in the median of the duration of the response observed in heat clearance, m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub> respectively [m<sub>1</sub> = 5.8 (SD 4.1) s, m<sub>2</sub> = 7.6 (SD 3.9) s, P < 0.001]. Conversely, for other ANS parameters, a significant decrease was seen in the post-test responses compared to pre-test responses in the imagining group [for instance, the median of the duration of the resistance responses decreased from m<sub>1</sub> = 12.6 (SD 4.3)s, and m<sub>2</sub> = 7.8 (SD 4.5) s. P < 0.0001 in imaginers, while no change was observed in non-imaginers: 9.6 (SD 6.0) s vs 9.5 (SD 6.1) s, NS] except in the duration of the heat clearance response where an increase was seen [m<sub>1</sub> = 7.3 (SD 5.0) s vs m<sub>2</sub> = 7.6 (SD 3.1) s, NS]. Compared to the non-imagining group, the latter result may also have been associated with a response decrease in the imagining group. Thus mental rehearsing induced a specific pattern of autonomic response: decreased amplitude, shorter duration and negative skin potentials compared to the control group. As this pattern was associated with better performance in the tests it can be suggested that in the case of open-ended motor activity, mental rehearsing may help in the construction of schema which can be reproduced, without thinking, in actual practice. Thus a neural information process might develop in the central nervous system changing from a parallel into a serial treatment.

Mais quelle place lui revient ? Le sport, en psychiatrie, ne subit-il pas les affres de l'amour, dans ses excès, ses passions ? Quel est le rapport entre activité physique, psychiatrie et amour ? Nous proposerons quelques voies de réflexion sur ces questions. Enfin, la présentation d'une vignette clinique éclairera la singularité d'un désir et d'une jouissance à l'?uvre dans une pratique sportive intensive.

AB - Dans ce travail, une série de recherches a été présentée, dont le but était d'examiner certaines caractéristiques des émotions compétitives et les aspects de la relation entre émotions et performance athlétique, à l'intérieur du cadre conceptuel de référence représenté par le modèle des Zones Individuelles de Fonctionnement Optimal (IZOF) étendu aux émotions. Dans le modèle IZOF, l'attention des chercheurs s'est surtout adressée à l'impact de l'anxiété sur la performance, alors que d'autres émotions n'avaient pas été suffisamment prises en considération. Etant donné que les hypothèses dérivées du modèle IZOF ont une importance théorique et pratique, d'autres recherches ont été conduites, dans le but d'en vérifier les principales notions et les hypothèses. Deux études ont confirmé que les émotions agréables peuvent aussi bien faciliter que perturber la performance et que, vice versa, les émotions désagréables peuvent aussi bien nuire qu'aider (renversement fonctionnel). En outre, il a été démontré que les émotions conventionnellement classées comme agréables peuvent être perçues comme désagréables et vice versa (renversement hédoniste). Les effets fonctionnel et hédoniste dépendent de la signification idiosyncrasique que les émotions revêtent pour l'individu et de l'intensité du vécu émotionnel. Prendre en considération ces deux effets - fonctionnel et hédoniste - permet une meilleure compréhension de l'expérience athlétique. Les quatre études successives, deux sur des groupes d'athlètes et deux sur des cas particuliers, ont permis de tester la notion centrale du modèle IZOF, qui prévoit de bonnes performances associées à des patrons optimaux d'émotions et des performances décevantes en relation à des patrons non fonctionnels. En accord avec les prévisions, dans les deux recherches sur des groupes d'athlètes, nous avons obtenu une différentiation des performances (bonne et décevante) et une discrimination des athlètes (de succès et de succès moindre) sur la base des émotions pré-compétitives. Ces résultats soutiennent l'hypothèse de l'existence de zones individuelles de fonctionnement optimal. Les deux autres études ont confirmé la notion des zones idéales de performance, en relation aussi avec des paramètres psychophysiques. Trois autres études ont été effectuées dans un but pratique plus spécifique: deux travaux ont permis de vérifier la possibilité, chez les athlètes, d'acquérir des procédés d'autorégulation afin d'obtenir des conditions psychophysiques aptes à faciliter la performance. La dernière étude a permis d'identifier les stratégies de préparation mentale adoptées par les athlètes experts en vue d'une compétition, de façon à obtenir des informations sur le développement de programmes individualisés de préparation mentale pour la compétition.

AB - The increasingly business-like environment of professional sport has resulted in greater scrutiny and analysis of players' performance. The roles of physiological parameters in predicting success in the world of professional and amateur sport are well established. However, to date, evidence is sparse concerning the role of personality traits in predicting such success. The present study examined the potency of measures of personality style and mental skills in predicting success in the criterion sport of professional rugby league. Mental toughness was assessed by questionnaire using the Psychological Performance Inventory. Hardiness was assessed by questionnaire using the Personal Views Survey III-R. Subjects in this study were 115 professional rugby league footballers representing the top three playing levels in the game in Great Britain (International, Super League, and Division One). Findings demonstrated that performers playing at the highest standard (International players) scored significantly higher in all three hardiness subscales (commitment, control and challenge) and in two of the seven mental toughness subscales (negative energy control and attention control). Results are discussed relative to previous findings, in particular, of the efficacy of high levels of hardiness. Practical implications focus on the advocacy of mental toughness and hardiness training to improve sports performance.

AB - It has been experimentally proven many times that the mental rehearsal of an activity not only improves motor performance but also has vegetative effects whose magnitude is correlated with the amount of imagined effort. These beneficial effects of mental imagery have been explained in terms of central programming structures capable of anticipating the metabolic demands of the task. Twenty-four subjects were asked to actually perform and also imagine an isometric contraction of the forearm under various goal conditions: a task-involving goal (8 subjects), an ego-involving goal (8 subjects), and no goal (8 subjects). During the contractions, electromyographic potential and heart rate were measured. Afterwards, the subjects were asked to indicate the amount of effort expended under different feedback conditions. The results showed no trace of electromyographic activity during the imagined contractions when the lack of movement was controlled using a force sensor. On the other hand, a significantly faster in heart rate was observed with a task- or ego-involving goal than with no goal, during both actual and imagined contraction. Similarly, as predicted, subjects said they applied less effort in the positive feedback condition, and more effort in the negative feedback condition with an ego-involving goal. The results are discussed in the light of goal theories, while regarding goals not only as serving to anticipate metabolic expenditures but also as promoting a self-image of competence, particularly in threatening, ego-involving situations.

AB - On distingue classiquement au sein de l'activité mentale d'un coureur à pied de longue distance les pensées associatives qui concernent toutes les sensations corporelles associées à l'effort et les pensées dissociatives qui renvoient à l'activité mentale dissociée de l'effort (rêveries, évocations autobiographiques, préoccupations personnelles). Cette dichotomie est à la base d'une étude récente menée chez des coureurs de marathon qui a eu pour objet de quantifier le temps passé pendant la course à quatre types d'activité cognitive: à focalisation interne (corporelle), à focalisation externe (performance), tournée vers l'intérieur de soi (rêveries) et tournée vers l'extérieur de soi (paysages, personnes [Stevinson et Biddie, 1998]). Les résultats montrent que chez l'ensemble des coureurs et quel que soit leur niveau, les pensées sont avant tout centrées sur la course et très prioritairement sur les sensations corporelles (focalisation ou monitoring interne). De surcroît, les coureurs dont les performances sont les meilleures sont ceux qui ont très peu de pensées tournées « vers l'intérieur » (rêveries, etc.). Contrairement à une idée reçue, l'entraînement à la course ne favorise donc pas les états de « flottement » ou de libres associations hédoniques. En revanche, la sensibilité aux éléments spatiaux environnants semble augmenter.

AB - Aim. The present study investigated the influence of personality on exercise-induced mood changes. It was hypothesised that a) exercise would be associated with significant mood enhancement across all personality types, b) extroversion would be associated with positive mood and neuroticism with negative mood both pre- and post-exercise, and c) personality measures would interact with exercise-induced mood changes. Methods. Participants were 90 female exercisers (M=25.8 y, SD=9.0 y) who completed the Eysenck Personality Inventory once and the Brunel Mood Scale before and after a 60-min exercise session. Median splits were used to group participants into 4 personality types: stable introverts (n=25), stable extroverts (n=20), neurotic introverts (n=26), and neurotic extroverts (n=19). Results. Repeated measures MANOVA showed significant mood enhancement following exercise across all personality types. Neuroticism was associated with negative mood scores pre-and post-exercise but the effect of extroversion on reported mood was relatively weak. There was no significant interaction effect between exercise-induced mood enhancement and personality. Conclusion. Findings lend support to the notion that exercise is associated with improved mood. However, findings show that personality did not influence this effect, although neuroticism was associated with negative mood.

AB - Objectifs. - Les processus mentaux (réactivité émotionnelle, concentration lors de la préparation à l'action, imagerie mentale) jouent un rôle essentiel dans la réalisation de performances sportives, surtout dans les épreuves où le contrôle de la charge mentale est un facteur déterminant de la réussite de l'action. Cependant, il est nécessaire de disposer de mesures objectives pour les étudier. L'objectif est de montrer comment les mesures neurovégétatives périphériques constituent un outil de recherche appliquée au sport. Actualités. - Le système nerveux végétatif (SNV) est fortement impliqué dans la régulation de l'éveil physiologique de l'organisme (activation). Il ajuste par anticipation les ressources du sujet, le préparant ainsi à agir. Les efférences végétatives produisent des réponses périphériques qui accompagnent les comportements. Elles représentent des mécanismes physiologiques inconscients, corrélats des processus mentaux et peuvent être enregistrées par des capteurs apposés sur la peau. Perspectives et projets.- L'utilisation de micro-capteurs non invasifs, associés à une chaîne de mesure portable, permet d'effectuer des enregistrements en situation réelle (compétition ou entraînement). Trois familles d'indices sont enregistrées: l'activité électrodermale (conductance et potentiel cutanés), thermovasculaire (température et débit sanguin cutanés) et cardiorespiratoire (fréquences cardiaque et respiratoire instantanées). Conclusion. - Cette méthode paraît donc particulièrement adaptée à la recherche sur la performance sportive en situation réelle.

AB - Nous cherchons à comprendre l'effet de l'expérience en danse ou en gymnastique, des capacités d'imagerie et de rotation mentale sur le rappel moteur d'une séquence dansée lorsque l'orientation spatiale du rappel diffère de l'orientation spatiale de la mémorisation. Nous pensons que les représentations construites par des novices seraient moins efficaces et plus dépendantes du contexte que celles des pratiquantes d'activités morphocinétiques. Vingt-quatre femmes ont été réparties en trois groupes: novices, gymnastes et danseuses. Les sujets répondaient au test d'imagerie MIQ de Hall et Pongrac (1983) et au test « S » de Thurstone et Thurstone (1967). Elles mémorisaient ensuite par observation une séquence dansée rappelée selon la même orientation (rappel normal), puis elles mémorisaient une autre séquence dansée qui était rappelée réorientée de 90° (rappel réorienté). Nous avons mesuré les temps totaux de rappel ainsi que les temps d'hésitation et nous avons évalué la qualité et l'exactitude de la reproduction motrice. Les résultats montrent que les gymnastes et les danseuses réalisent un meilleur rappel normal de la séquence dansée que les novices, même en dehors de leur domaine d'expertise pour les gymnastes. Les capacités d'imagerie et de rotation mentale mesurées ne peuvent pas expliquer les différences entre les groupes. La réorientation entre la mémorisation et le rappel moteur affecte de manière identique l'exactitude de la reproduction motrice quelle que soit l'expérience vécue en danse ou gymnastique. Cependant, nous observons une distribution différente des temps de rappel et d'hésitation entre les groupes et entre les deux modalités de rappel, ce qui laisse supposer l'existence de processus vicariants. Notamment, il semblerait que la tâche de rappel moteur réorienté fasse appel à des stratégies mnémoniques spécifiques construites dès l'encodage.

AB - La recherche sur l'intervention en milieu sportif devrait logiquement bénéficier directement aux praticiens qui pourraient ainsi s'en nourrir pour enrichir leur action. Si une analyse de la littérature anglophone a été réalisée (Gilbert & Trudel, 2004), rien ne permet actuellement de caractériser le corpus de références disponible en langue française. Nous avons répertorié les articles parus pendant les 20 dernières années et les avons analysés en vue de comparer les résultats avec ceux de l'étude centrée sur les publications anglophones. Parmi les dimensions prises en compte figurent l'objet de recherche, la méthodologie générale, les instruments de collecte de données utilisés mais aussi les caractéristiques des participants concernés et du contexte d'entraînement. La fréquence annuelle de publication des articles francophones est dix fois moins importante, notamment en raison du nombre restreint de revues disponibles. L'analyse des 48 articles répertoriés indique, entre autres, (a) que l'objet de recherche le plus étudié est le comportement de l'entraîneur (60,4 %), (b) qu'il y a presque autant de recherches quantitatives (43,8 %) que qualitatives (41,7 %), (c) que l'entrevue est l'instrument de collecte de données le plus utilisé (41,7 %), et que (d) les entraîneurs masculins sont plus souvent les participants impliqués dans les études (37,5 %). Dans la discussion, nous soulignons le risque majeur de voir se creuser le fossé entre les chercheurs et les praticiens.

AB - La profession d'entraîneur de football ne s'établit définitivement en France qu'à la fin des années 40. Divers éléments convergent pour différer son apparition: les mentalités des joueurs, considérant que le sport ne saurait être une contrainte, et peu enclins à s'entraîner, celles des dirigeants, préférant le racolage à l'engagement d'un spécialiste, le pouvoir politique démocratique et peu favorable au professionnalisme. Le personnage emblématique du capitaine d'équipe a également contribué à retarder l'éclosion de l'entraîneur. Mais le soutien de la presse, ainsi que celui des anciens pratiquants ont permis son recrutement, renforcé par la création de formations officielles, en 1929, puis de diplômes nationaux, depuis 1942, avant tout destinés à former des cadres d'origine française, et à impulser le progrès du football hexagonal. Avec cette reconnaissance institutionnelle, le poids des responsabilités qui pèsent sur l'entraîneur s'est encore accru, d'autant qu'il s'accompagne désormais d'une médiatisation croissante dans la presse écrite, qui jusque là était dévolue aux seuls joueurs.

AB - This article reports the first phase of a three-phase research programme investigating the prevalence and long-term sequelae associated with sexual abuse in a non-psychiatric sample of maleand femaleAustralian athletes. A cross-sectional, retrospective design, using a mailed survey, provided a quantitative assessment of sexual abuse prevalence in a national sample of elite athletes and a regional sample of club athletes. Results from the total sample (n = 370) revealed that 31% of female and 21% of male athletes reported experiencing sexual abuse at some time in their lives. Of these, 41% of females, and 29% of males had been sexually abused within the sports environment. It was also found that almost half, 46.4%, of the elite group reporting sexual abuse had been sexually abused by sports personnel. For the club group, this figure was 25.6%. Implications of these results and current initiatives for the prevention of sexual abuse of athletes in Australia are discussed.

AB - This paper examines the relationship between eating disorders and problems in interpersonal functioning. Questionnaires that measure eating problems, interpersonal adjustment, and general neuroticism were completed by several groups of women: anorexic patients, persons whose interests or occupations involved a concern about bodily shape or condition (dancers, models, and athletes), and members of the general public. A substantial and significant relationship was found between eating symptomatology and interpersonal functioning in all groups. However, this association survived only in the anorexic patient group when general neuroticism was partialled out. We take this to imply that psychosocial difficulties are unlikely to play a strong role in the initial development of eating problems.

AB - Dans le domaine de la recherche en psychomotricité, faire du sport est indéniablement reconnu comme étant une source d'équilibre et de santé physique et psychique. La santé, dans la vision médicale holistique prônée par l'ostéopathie suppose que le corps parle et qu'il est riche d'enseignement. On dit « écouter son corps »... Dans le sport, la performance nécessaire à l'esprit de compétition impose que le psychisme domine et commande le corps. Le corps devient alors un instrument que l'on essaye d'utiliser au mieux. Il subit un « conditionnement » pour obtenir une efficacité maximale dans l'activité sportive choisie et pratiquée. Dans ce cas peut-on encore être à l'écoute de son corps? Cela nous amène à nous interroger sur la notion des limites du corps et de la nécessité de pouvoir les définir. A l'issue de ces réflexions, parler de santé et de performance associées ne présente t-il pas un paradoxe? En effet ces deux notions dénoncent deux logiques qui semblent contraires mais auxquelles chaque sportif quel que soit son niveau athlétique se retrouve confronté un jour de façon consciente ou pas.

AB - Drawing upon the methodology developed by Kenny and Acitelli (2001), this study examined empathic accuracy and assumed similarity in both parties' perceptions of coach-athlete relationships. One hundred and twenty-one coaches and athletes reported on their direct-perceptions and meta-perceptions of closeness, commitment and complementarity (3 Cs; Jowett & Cockerill, 2002), and of satisfaction with instruction, performance and external agents. There was evidence of both empathic accuracy and assumed similarity in coaches' and athletes' perceptions. Athletes were more accurate in identifying the specific content of their coaches' feelings in terms of closeness. Athletes and coaches from newly developed relationships displayed higher levels of empathic accuracy, whereas female athletes displayed higher levels of assumed similarity. Moreover, evidence suggested that athletes' and coaches' assumed similarity led to more accurate perceptions. Implications and future research directions are discussed.

AB - Former, transmettre, éduquer sont des concepts polysémiques. Ceux-ci n'ont de substances qu'au regard des finalités poursuivies. Ainsi les pratiques physiques sont souvent présentées comme un vecteur du développement de la personne. Cette année « européenne de l'éducation par le sport » témoigne de l'importance de ce phénomène mais aussi de son ambivalence. Le sport de compétition: Instrument d'assujettissement ou moyen d'épanouissement? La physique contemporaine nous dit que tout est contradiction. Chaque élément possède en lui son contraire aussi virtuel qu'il soit. Il est donc essentiel de maintenir constamment une « attention ouverte » et de développer une intelligence corporelle dans des contextes émotionnels différenciés afin de faire émerger des états d'équilibre transitoires et successifs entre les tendances contradictoires. L'organisme possède des structures coopératives spontanées que notre mode de vie moderne ne mobilise que partiellement. Un nouveau mode de relation à soi et aux autres ne peut s'actualiser qu'avec une prise de conscience de cette nouvelle conscience. La réflexion est illustrée par les contenus d'enseignement en athlétisme proposés aux étudiants de licence préparant le professorat d'éducation physique.

AB - Background: Eating disorders are frequent among elite performers of certain sports or physical activities; however, little is known about non-professional performers. Method: 113 female non-elite ballet dancers, 54 female gymnasium users, 44 male non-competitive body builders, 105 female controls and 30 male controls were evaluated using the Body Uneasiness Test, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Eating Disorder Examination 12th edition (EDE-12). Results: Non-elite ballet dancers reported the highest prevalence of eating disorders (anorexia nervosa 1.8%; bulimia nervosa 2.7%; eating disorders not otherwise specified 22.1%), followed by gymnasium users (anorexia nervosa 2.6%; eating disorders not otherwise specified 18%). Significant differences (p < 0.01) between athletes and their controls were found in the following parameters (median values): Beck Depression Inventory (female dancers 5.7, gymnasium users 6.1, female controls 2.8, body builders 1.6, and male controls 1.3), Body Uneasiness Test (female dancers 1.08, gymnasium users 0.62, female controls 0.54, body builders 0.35, and male controls 0.27), EDE total scores (female dancers 1.6, gymnasium users 1.7, female controls 1.0, body builders 1.0, and male controls 0.4), EDE - restraint subscale scores (female dancers 0.8, gymnasium users 1.6, female controls 0.0, body builders 0.8, and male controls 0.0), EDE- eating concern subscale scores (female dancers 0.4, gymnasium users 0.2, female controls 0.0, body builders 0.0, and male controls 0.0), EDE - weight concern subscale scores (female dancers 2.1, gymnasium users 2.1, female controls 1.6, body builders 1.4, and male controls 0.5), and EDE - shape concern subscale scores (female dancers 2.7, gymnasium users 2.8, female controls 2.0, body builders 2.1, and male controls 0.9). EDE scores were highly related to Body Uneasiness Test scores, especially in non-elite ballet dancers and in non-competitive body builders (p < 0.01). Conclusion: Non-professional performers of sports emphasising thinness or muscularity, such as ballet and body-building, show a high degree of body uneasiness and inappropriate eating attitudes and behaviours.

Deux situations de jeu filmées au haut niveau, ainsi que deux combinaisons qu'ils proposent, permettent d'explorer les codes graphiques couramment utilisés, et notamment à propos des aspects décisionnels du jeu. Les résultats mettent en valeurs les besoins en matière de représentation (pouvoir disposer de codes distinctifs, d'indications concises), ainsi que la difficulté à rendre compte des aspects décisionnels du jeu qui représentent la clé dans la mise en place de combinaisons efficaces. De plus, à travers l'exploration des différentes formes de représentations graphiques, trois niveaux de conception des combinaisons de jeu sont mis en évidence. Ceux-ci se différencient à la fois par le niveau de structuration des objets graphiques utilisés, et par le niveau de complexification observé dans les différentes composantes du jeu (aspects descriptifs, balistiques et plus particulièrement décisionnels).

AB - Demographic data, exercise habits, weight control behavior, attitudes towards body shape, eating disorder (ED) experience, and menstrual regularity among female fitness instructors were descriptively assessed. A 60-item questionnaire was sent to 295 female fitness instructors at eight fitness centers. Responders (57%) reported a mean weekly exercise load of 5.5 h week<sup>-1</sup> (SD 2.6), which indicates frequent training, however, less than that of athletes. Overall, 35% reported ED experience (DSM-IV criteria), with an onset at 15-17 years of age. The problems had lasted 5-7 years, and 20% of the entire group reported recovery, however, 11% still had EDs. For the entire group, it was found that a high weekly exercise load was linked to a pathological weight control behavior. Fitness instructors with an active ED exercised more than instructors who never had an ED or who had a past ED. Menstrual irregularity was more common among instructors who did not use contraceptives (14%), compared to those who did (5%). As ED experience and pathological weight control behavior were common in the studied group, the importance of guidelines regarding communication from female fitness instructors about healthy training habits to regular exercisers is discussed in the article.

AB - The sporting culture, with omnipotent coaches, fierce competition for recognition and funding, and 'win at all costs' ethos, creates an environment conducive to sexual exploitation of athletes. Recent increased public awareness and the development of child protection policies in sport have led to the questioning of previously accepted coach-athlete relationships. This study is an exploratory investigation into male swimming coaches' perceptions of appropriateness of coach-athlete sexual relationships. Sexual relationships with athletes under the age of 16 were unanimously considered totally inappropriate. With regard to sexual relationships with athletes above the age of consent, opinions ranged from 'totally inappropriate' to 'it's a question of civil liberties.' These results are discussed in relation to how coaches have adapted their own behaviours in the face of public scrutiny but are still reluctant to restrict the rights of their fellow coaches.

Participants were 482 athletes (male n = 305; female n = 177), aged between 16 and 45 years (M age = 20.44 years, SD = 3.98). In support of a priori predictions, mental toughness was associated with stress intensity and control appraisal, but not the type of stressor experienced by athletes. Total mental toughness and its six components predicted coping and coping effectiveness in relation to the self-selected stressor. In particular, higher levels of mental toughness were associated with more problem-focused coping, but less emotion-focused and avoidance coping. Coping effectiveness was influenced by the coping strategy employed by the athletes.

AB - L'entraînement à la prise de décisions (Vickers, 2001) est une approche visant à solliciter un effort cognitif accru chez les sportifs afin de mieux les préparer aux exigences tactiques de la compétition. Les objectifs de la présente étude sont (a) de décrire l'implantation de « l'entraînement à la prise de décisions » au sein d'un groupe constitué d'un entraîneur et de neuf (9) joueurs d'une équipe de football canadien de niveau universitaire, et (b) de présenter l'évolution des performances de ces derniers au cours de 13 séances d'entraînement. Les résultats démontrent que cette approche d'entraînement favorise les occasions de répondre des participants, une condition essentielle à l'apprentissage. Quatorze des 19 éducatifs utilisés ont fait appel à des outils de l'entraînement à la prise de décisions (Vickers, 2001). Les performances du groupe se sont améliorées, particulièrement à la fin du processus d'entraînement, confirmant les conclusions de la recherche. Les résultats démontrent également que l'entraînement à la prise de décisions s'intègre très bien aux activités sportives où il y a une interaction directe avec un adversaire. La clé du succès repose sur une utilisation judicieuse de ses outils selon certaines variables contextuelles, dont le niveau d'habileté des participants.

L'étude a porté d'abord sur les comportements du porteur de balle confronté à une tâche de duel standardisée à 1/1 qui reproduit les exigences des situations naturelles. Les résultats montrent que, si les conditions de l'affrontement ne varient pas, le joueur utilise les invariants du milieu pour déclencher des connaissances procédurales produisant des réponses motrices stables dans le temps et dans l'espace. En revanche, si les exigences spatiales du duel varient, les experts s'adaptent mieux que les joueurs «confirmés» aux variations. Le joueur de haut niveau utiliserait des structures mentales assimilatrices (les «schémas») afin de transférer dans les situations nouvelles des procédures déjà mémorisées qui ont été appliquées avec succès dans des contextes isomorphes. Enfin, la vitesse de la prise de décision dans des situations simulées de jeu global a été mise en corrélation avec la vitesse de traitement de l'information dans des processus cognitifs élémentaires. Ces processus manipulent l'information dans des opérations parcellaires et automatisées, assurant des fonctions uniques et bien spécifiées. Les corrélations n'ont pas montré nettement une telle interaction

AB - The relationship between excessive exercise and eating disorder, both in terms of aetiology and maintenance, has been widely discussed in the extant literature but there are no treatment guidelines. The utility of a specific cognitive-behavioral treatment that included exposure with response prevention, targeted at excessive exercise, was examined in six patients with anorexia nervosa.

AB - L'utilisation de critères communs aux consommations de substances et aux addictions comportementales permet d'envisager les addictions dans une perspective globale dans laquelle personnalité, stress et coping ont pu être identifiés comme associés aux conduites addictives. Dans ce contexte, cette étude vise à approfondir les relations entre ces caractéristiques psychologiques et diverses formes d'addiction auprès d'une population de jeunes adultes. Méthode: l'intensité de huit conduites addictives a été évaluée à l'aide d'autoquestionnaires spécifiques auprès d'un échantillon de 341 jeunes adultes effectuant des études à l'université. Trois questionnaires d'auto-évaluation ont été administrés afin d'évaluer la personnalité, le stress perçu et les stratégies de coping. Résultats: les données montrent un lien négatif entre le trait de personnalité consciencieux et toutes les formes d'addiction à des substances. Le stress perçu et les stratégies de coping ne sont associés qu'à certaines addictions spécifiques, avec ou sans substance. Ces deux caractéristiques permettent cependant de prédire significativement plusieurs addictions. La personnalité, bien que liée aux addictions, n'a pas de caractère véritablement prédictif. Discussion: la nature des liens entre stress perçu et addictions est questionnée. Certaines conduites addictives pourraient avoir une fonction adaptative permettant d'affronter les difficultés rencontrées et de réguler certaines émotions.

AB - We studied whether the ventilatory responses to imagined exercise are influenced by automatic processes. Twenty-nine athletes produced mental images of a sport event with successive focus on the environment, the preparation, and the exercise. Mean breathing frequency increased from 15 to 22 breaths/min. Five participants reported having voluntarily controlled breathing, two of them during preparation. Twenty participants reported that their breathing pattern changed during the experiment: 11 participants were unable to correctly report on the direction of changes in frequency, and 13 incorrectly reported changes in amplitude. This finding suggests that these changes were not voluntary in most participants and may therefore reveal automatic forebrain influences on exercise hyper-pnea. However, these changes may also reflect nonspecific processes (e.g., arousal) different from those occurring during actual exercise.

AB - Second-to-fourth digit ratio, a marker for prenatal testosterone levels, has been shown to be associated with sporting achievement in men. It is unclear, however, whether digit ratio makes a contribution over and above salient personality variables. The present study, which included female participants, measured four personality traits and one cognitive ability (mental rotation) that have been linked to both sports achievement and sex. The significant relationship between digit ratio and sporting achievement was nearly identical in women and men. A multiple regression showed that when significant correlates of sporting ability (weight, height, years playing, hours per week training, social potency, and mental rotation) were entered first, the contribution of digit ratio remained highly significant. We suggest that physiological as well as psychological factors may be an important avenue for future study.

AB - Cette étude aborde la relation entraîneur-entraîné à partir d'une perspective clinique analytique. Celle-ci présume que des phénomènes transférentiels, des répétitions, sont en jeu dans la relation entre un sportif et son entraîneur. Les répétitions et possibilités de transformation se mettent en perspective en fonction de la structuration familiale du sportif: en quoi la structure familiale vient-elle jouer un rôle dans la relation? Comment les relations initiales plus ou moins structurées avec les parents auront-elles des conséquences sur la relation avec l'entraîneur? Le but de cette recherche est donc de repérer si la relation à l'entraîneur introduit une continuité ou une discontinuité par rapport à la structuration familiale initiale. Des entretiens cliniques ont été effectués auprès d'athlètes de haut niveau. À travers chaque histoire singulière d'athlète, s'énonce une structure identifiable:la rencontre d'un autre, une relation à l'entraîneur répondant à un manque, et la mise en perspective d'un désir particulier d'entraîner à travers les dires de l'entraîneur.

AB - L'objectif de cette étude consiste à étudier le mode de leadership des entraîneurs de division nationale et de division d'honneur en Tunisie. Selon la littérature, le processus de l'interaction entraîneur-entraîné, est considéré comme un facteur déterminant de la performance. Pour évoluer les dimensions qui composent le comportement de l'entraîneur, le modèle multidimensionnel de leadership scale dons le sport (LS.S.) de Chelladurai (1978), est devenu l'outil le plus utilisé dons la dernière décade. Il permet d'obtenir des informations concernant les styles d'interactions (entraînement, récomposeras, support social) et les styles de décision (démocratique, autocratique). Notre population d'étude se compose de dix entraîneurs de division nationale et de six entraîneurs de division d'honneur. De cette étude, il découle ce qui suit: * Le mode de leadership des entraîneurs de division nationale se rapproche de celui des entraîneurs européens: les comportements d'entraînement et de récompense, sont les plus importants. Tandis que, on trouve le comportement autocratique en dernier lieu. * Il existe une optique très différente selon: - le niveau de l'entraîneur - l'origine de sa formation - et de son recyclage En effet, nous avons relevé une prédominance des comportements d'entraînement et de récompense chez les entraîneurs de division nationale, et d'entraînement autocratique chez les entraîneurs de division d'honneur. En ce qui concerne la prise de décision, on note également que le comportement autocratique est le moins apprécié chez les entraîneurs de division nationale, alors que chez les entraîneurs de division d'honneur c'est le comportement démocratique qui est le moins apprécié.

AB - In this paper, we review the empirical literature pertaining to the effectiveness of instructions and movement demonstrations. Initially, we examine existing theories and approaches that try to explain the process of skill acquisition so as to determine implications of these theories for instructional provision. This is followed by an evaluation of studies in the motor learning literature in which pre-practice information has been manipulated. Explicit learning strategies are contrasted to implicit and discovery learning methods, and current explanations for instructional effects are discussed in terms of such mechanisms as effects-related attentional focus and movement variability. In the final sections, we review data from our own laboratory where pre-practice information has been manipulated during the learning of a novel bimanual coordination task. From these studies, proposals are made to try and explain how pre-practice information works to effect the process of skill acquisition, including the selection and execution of a response and the processing of associated feedback. An important role is given to the existing skills of the learner in understanding the instructions and performing the desired movement. Finally, we suggest some practical implications of this empirical evidence for the teaching of motor skills.

AB - The elaborated intrusion (EI) theory of desire (Kavanagh, Andrade, & May, 2005) attributes the motivational force of cravings to cognitive elaboration, including imagery, of apparently spontaneous thoughts that intrude into awareness. We report a questionnaire study in which respondents rated a craving for food or drink. Questionnaire items derived from El theory formed a single factor alongside factors for anticipated reward/relief, resistance, and opportunity. In a multiple regression predicting strength of craving, the first three factors accounted for 36% of the variance. Opportunity did not enter the model. In a second study, the difference between individuals' strong and weak cravings to take part in a sporting activity was shown to be related to visual, auditory, and general imagery, and to anticipated reward or relief from engaging in the activity. Implications for treatment of craving-related disorders are discussed in the light of these results and of other research indicating that interference with imagery can reduce the strength of craving.

AB - Although research into coaching has increased considerably during the last two decades, an area of neglect has been that of the professional youth coach. The aim of this study was to investigate the working behaviours of six top-level professional soccer coaches. Data were collected using a modified version of the Arizona State University Observation Instrument and semi-structured interviews. The triangulation of the data ensured that both the "what" and the "why" of the coaches' behaviour were considered. Results revealed a conscious and well thought out pattern of behaviour: silently monitoring, interspersed with clips of instruction coupled with praise and encouragement. The interviews revealed three themes underpinning this behaviour: developing game understanding, support and encouragement, and coaches' role and influences. The use of silence was the largest single behaviour, the efficacy of which was considered in light of theories of experiential and discovery learning.

AB - L'échange de paroles dans la relation entraîneur-entraîné est une nécessité pour l'obtention de la performance, du fait de son incertitude. La modalité de parole requise n'est pas celle de la description technique, scientifique ou éducative, mais celle de l'interprétation qui engage les singularités de chaque partenaire à propos d'une performance motrice dont les conditions ne sont jamais totalement prévisibles. Le croisement du discours analytique et du discours sportif, à partir des interventions de parole de praticiens exerçant dans le champ sportif, nous permettra de dégager un espace irréductible à tout idéal, à tout attendu, à tout prévu. Ce lieu vide est celui de l'inconscient, point à partir duquel un sportif se décidera ou pas de venir pousser son corps au-delà d'une limite établie par les records déjà là. Le chemin vers la performance sportive passe par des prises de parole inédites, véritables franchissements subjectifs articulant le désir de l'entraîneur à celui du sportif. La référence à l'enseignement de Lacan dans la psychanalyse nous permettra d'extraire quelques principes concernant la logique de l'acte sportif d'exception.

AB - L'étude des manifestations neurovégétatives exprimées en réponse à une habileté motrice complexe n'a été possible qu'avec l'évolution des données classiques de la neurophysiologie et des méthodes de mesure multiparamétriques. L'analyse du niveau tonique confirme la forte stéréotypie neurovégétative individuelle due aux exigences perceptivo-affectivo-motrices de la tâche sportive. L'analyse du niveau phasique, en associant la performance des sujets à leurs réponses végétatives, a démontré que ces dernières constituaient un modèle inférentiel, capable d'objectiver et d'analyser le fonctionnement du système nerveux central. Les processus neurovégétatifs sous-tendant la pratique de l'imagerie mentale ont pu être objectivés en temps réel, confirmant les premières études de l'équipe. La quantification du processus d'imagerie a permis de distinguer des réponses neurovégétatives spécifiques développées au cours de cette pratique: les motifs ainsi obtenus confirment, pour la première fois, la thèse de la possibilité d'un entraînement (mental) viscéro-moteur. La qualité des images mentales ainsi générées, estimée à travers leurs manifestations neurovégétatives et associée aux performances des sujets a permis de définir de nouveaux critères liés à la qualité de l'imagerie: existence de réponses neurovégétatives, évolution de la vigilance au cours de la tâche, évolution de l'anxiété situationnelle et de la concentration. L'excellente corrélation de cet indicateur (somme des données précitées) avec l'amélioration de la performance permet de postuler qu'il constitue un outil efficace pour apprécier la qualité de l'imagerie mentale

AB - Aim of the Study: Exercise dependence is an inadequate pattern of exercise leading to clinically significant negative consequences. Subjects present loss of control of their physical activity, tolerance, and withdrawal symptoms when they do not practice sport. We studied the prevalence of exercise dependence among clients of a Parisian fitness room. We also assessed alcohol and nicotine use disorders, 2 other "socially tolerated" behavioral addictions (compulsive buying and Internet addiction), and 2 disorders related to anxiety focused on the body (bulimia and hypochondria). Method: All clients of the fitness room 18 years and older were invited to participate in the study. Three hundred subjects were included; 125 (42%) presented diagnostic criteria of exercise dependence. Unsurprisingly, exercise dependents spent more hours each day in the fitness center practicing (2.1 vs 1.5 hours per day). They went to the fitness center more often each week (3.5 vs 2.9 days per week). Exercise addicts smoked less; alcohol consumption was equivalent in both groups. Compulsive buying was significantly more frequent in exercise dependents (63% vs 38%), which means they scored higher in the compulsive buying scale (5.4 vs 4.1). Prevalence of hypochondria was equivalent in both groups, but scores in the Whiteley Index of Hypochondria were higher (4.1 vs 3) in the exercise-dependent group. Bulimia was significantly more frequent among exercise dependents (70% vs 47%), who also presented a higher number of bulimic episodes each week (2.5 vs 1.3). Subjects with exercise dependence spent more time on their computer each day (3.9 vs 2.4 hours per day). We found no difference regarding time spent using Internet, the number of e-mails sent or received, and their time at speaking on a cellular phone. Conclusion: Our results lead to systematically study the addictive relation to exercise among regular clients of the fitness rooms. Exercise addicts are exposed to negative consequences for their excess of physical activity. Exercise addiction is also associated to compulsive buying, bulimia, and, in a lesser extent, hypochondria.

AB - Current research in coaching development infers that coaching is predominantly a decision-making process. The same and other research is not, however, informing the coaching development process due to a lack of a big picture approach. Consequently, there is a need for a model of coaching. In this paper, we offer such a model in the form of a schematic that reflects the coaching process from both a content and information-processing stance. To assess the validity of the schematic, 16 expert coaches were interviewed to elicit a complete description of their coaching process. The coaches were then shown a copy of the schematic and asked to comment on its design and content with respect to its accuracy in reflecting their coaching process. Following analysis of the interview, six general categories emerged: Roles, Goals, Typical Actions, Required Knowledge, Support for the Schematic, and Factors Influencing Development. The first four categories clearly displayed an implicit support for the schematic. Furthermore, all coaches offered explicit support for the schematic. Such strong support confirmed that the schematic was valid and could form the basis of focused interventions in coaching development.

AB - Aujourd'hui le sport de haut-niveau contraint les athlètes à un investissement croissant. La préparation mentale permet de les optimiser leurs capacités psychiques pour affronter les temps de compétition, notamment en termes de gestion de stress, de «conditionnement» à l'exercice. Pour se faire l'athlète dispose de différentes formes d'exercices et de méthodes, dont les plus fréquemment rencontrées sont la «relaxation progressive», le «training autogène» et la «sophrologie dynamique». Malgré des approches relativement différentes - voire épistémologiquement opposées - ces trois méthodes offrent une place particulière et similaire à l'imagerie mentale et la proprioception. Ces différentes méthodes de relaxation permettent le travail d'une nouvelle réalité, épurée de tout affect. En se focalisant sur la proprioception, l'athlète apprend dans un premier temps à agir en pilotage automatique, dans un deuxième temps à optimiser sa gestuelle sportive et enfin à apprécier les différents états du corps. L'amélioration des qualités proprioceptives conduisent l'athlète vers une gestuelle réfléchie, où les phases de contraction et de relâchement se succèdent en fonction des besoins de sollicitation. L'imagerie mentale consiste en la création d'un film mental, interne ou externe. Cette répétition grandeur nature du projet d'action permet à l'athlète d'acquérir une première expérience du projet moteur. L'athlète vit la course de l'intérieur. Il imagine son corps en action. Il passe et repasse dans les différentes trajectoires en anticipant les différentes variabilités environnementales.

AB - The concept of mental toughness is widely used, but empirical evidence is required to fully understand this construct and its related variables. The purpose of this paper was to explore the relationship between: (a) mental toughness and coping, (b) mental toughness and optimism, and (c) coping and optimism. Participants were 677 athletes (male 454; female 223) aged between 15 and 58 years (M age = 22.66 years, SD = 7.20). Mental toughness correlated significantly with 8 of the 10 coping subscales and optimism. In particular, higher levels of mental toughness were associated with more problem or approach coping strategies (mental imagery, effort expenditure, thought control, and logical analysis) but less use of avoidance coping strategies (distancing, mental distraction, and resignation). Eight coping subscales were significantly correlated with optimism and pessimism. In conclusion, the relationships observed in this study emphasize the need for the inclusion of coping and optimism training in mental toughness interventions.

AB - The aim of this study was to establish whether different motivational profiles that result from performing a cluster analysis reflect the use of different functions and amounts of imagery. One hundred and five competitive swimmers were recruited to participate in the study. They were asked to complete both the Task and Ego Orientation in Sport Questionnaire (TEOSQ) and the Sport Imagery Questionnaire. The results of a K-means cluster analysis on the TEOSQ scores resulted in a three-cluster solution that maximized between-group differences and minimized within-group differences. A multivariate analysis of variance revealed that the three cluster groups could be distinguished by their use of imagery. Specifically, the results indicated that individuals with a 'complementary balance' between task and ego orientations were more motivated to perform the functions of imagery that would help them to maximize their performance.

AB - Sur base de la littérature dans le domaine, les objectifs de la recherche sont de déterminer le rapport entre les comportements anxiogènes de l'entraîneur évalués selon le questionnaire (ICAT) de Serpa (1997) et les caractéristiques des athlètes, des entraîneurs et de la situation à partir de variables spéaifiques: athlètes (anxiété, personnalité), entraîneurs (style de leadership et perception par l'athlète), situation: (ambiance de groupe) 642 individus ont répondu aux tests suivants: Sport competition anxiety test et Compétition state anxiety inventory de Martens, QPS de Thill, Leadership scale for sports de Chelladurai, Ployer coach interaction inventory de Medford et Thorpe group environment questionnaire de Widmeyer, Brawley et Larron et Inventaire de comportements anxiogènes de l'entraîneur. L'analyse statistique des résultats amènent l'auteur aux conclusions suivantes: - L'entraîneur est en général perçu comme étant peu anxiogène. Toutefois les comportements de communication et dans une moindre mesure les comportements révélant une tension émotionnelle perturbent le plus les athlètes. - Les entraîneurs les plus anxiogènes sont moins bien perçus par les athlètes et ont des comportements d'entraînement de support social et de renforcement peu élevés avec un style de décision plus autocratique. - Les athlètes percevant leurs entraîneurs comme plus anxiogènes sont eux-mêmes plus anxieux et moins confiants en eux; prennent moins de risque et sont moins combatifs dans la défense de positions personnelles. - Les groupes dont les entraîneurs sont perçus comme plus émotionnellement perturbateurs semblent susciter chez les sportifs une attraction plus réduite pour les activités sociales.

Data were obtained from a sample of 472 athletes competing across a range of performance standards in a wide variety of sports. Exploratory factor analyses of their responses produced eight competition strategy subscales and eight practice strategy subscales, each consisting of four items. Internal consistencies of the subscales ranged from 0.66 to 0.81 (x = 0.75). Correlations among strategies were examined within and between performance contexts. Subgroups defined by age, sex and current standard of performance in sport differed significantly in their psychological skills and strategies.

AB - We examined the performance environment of the England youth soccer teams. Using a conceptually grounded questionnaire developed from the themes identified by Pain and Harwood (2007), 82 players and 23 national coaches and support staff were surveyed directly following international tournaments regarding the factors that positively and negatively influenced performance. The survey enabled data to be captured regarding both the extent and magnitude of the impact of the factors comprising the performance environment. Overall, team and social factors were generally perceived to have the greatest positive impact, with players and staff showing high levels of consensus in their evaluations. Team leadership and strong team cohesion were identified by both groups as having the greatest positive impact. Overall, far fewer variables were perceived to have a negative impact on performance, especially for players. The main negatives common to both groups were players losing composure during games, player boredom, and a lack of available activities in the hotel. The major findings support those of Pain and Harwood (2007) and in using a larger sample helped to corroborate and strengthen the generalizability of the findings.

AB - Nous proposons dans cet article d'étudier les formes singulières que peuvent prendre les savoirs scientifiques lorsqu'ils sont appropriés par des acteurs et d'envisager comment ils peuvent intervenir dans l'action en adoptant le point de vue d'un sociologue. Les savoirs résultant de cette appropriation ont une forme singulière et syncrétique et fournissent un système de justifications de l'action en même temps qu'un réservoir dans lequel l'acteur peut puiser des éléments de réflexion sur son action. Les savoirs étudiés constituent des schèmes interprétatifs partagés construits sur la base de savoirs scientifiques mais aussi sur un usage transmis de leurs conséquences pratiques jouant le rôle de conventions et permettant d'établir un lien entre savoirs scientifiques et pratique. Nous mettons en évidence les processus d'opérationalisation des savoirs, condition de leur mobilisation comme ressources de l'action, et envisageons leur lien avec les savoirs scientifiques objectivés. La distance entre les deux est certaine mais le lien s'établit à travers la constitution de noyaux opérationnels et la valorisation du savoir scientifique comme référence avérée.

AB - Nous avançons ici l'hypothèse que le sport pourrait compromettre l'alliance thérapeutique dans le cas des suivis psychiatriques. Notre approche est phénoménologique, anthropologique et clinique, et se fonde sur l'observation de trois patients détenus. Cette hypothèse a été vérifiée; en revanche, elle n'est pas généralisable à toute la population carcérale. Lorsque le suivi psychiatrique et psychothérapique n'est plus corrélé positivement avec la notion d'alliance thérapeutique en raison de certaines activités sportives dans la cour de promenade, apparaissent un facteur de risque et une prédictivité de rechute pour les maladies bipolaires et les décompensations cliniques auto- ou hétéroagressives. Psychiatrie, sport, produits stimulants, produits sédatifs, telles sont les composantes du monde de la cour de promenade et de la psychopathologie en milieu carcéral à la maison d'arrêt de Fleury-Mérogis. Parmi les variables étudiées, nous avons retenu celles-ci: le sexe, l'âge, les antécédents personnels de santé et les antécédents judiciaires; ces trois patients sont inculpés pour attentat à la pudeur avec agression sexuelle, meurtres, trafic de stupéfiants. Nous avons analysé le fait que ces trois patients détenus décompensent sur un même mode: bipolarité suivie d'hospitalisation d'office, qui amène à son tour la modification du cheminement pénal initialement prévu.

AB - Research design is the basis from which study outcomes are obtained. Unfortunately, a multitude of methodological design combinations has historically been used to examine the phenomenon of mental practice relative to motor behaviour. The present paper contends that these varied methodological combinations obscure efforts to produce a solid foundation of mental practice evidence. The paper presents an overview of the implemented mental practice research designs via a methodological components model and illustrates how this model can be used to clarify design issues of past mental practice research, and plan more effective future studies. Analysis of past research demonstrates the need for a balanced emphasis between study design and study outcome, and suggests a more explicit methodological focus in order to promote more effectively designed mental practice studies in the future.

AB - It is now well established that mental imagery practice improves motor skills, but performance efficiency depends on many factors: the main one being individual differences. The aim of this study is to evaluate performance improvement with imagery quality estimated during ANS recording. Volleyball training (receiving serve) afforded us the experimental paradigm. Subjects were required to pass an opponent's serve to a given team mate. The receiver's performance was evaluated from the accuracy of his pass to the targeted team mate. From these first test results, subjects were divided into two equivalent groups: imagers and controls. After mental practice the two groups were submitted to a posttest similar to the first one. During the pretest, posttest actual practice as well as the last session of corresponding mental rehearsal, six autonomic parameters were continuously recorded. Furthermore, and for the first time, a grade obtained from four different aspects of this response permits qualitative evaluation of each subject's mental imagery. This estimation, based on the well-established link between performance and autonomic response, is validated by the fact that good correlation was obtained between this grade and the performance improvement of each of the imager group subjects.

AB - There is a need to provide practical applications of psychology to improve the quality of performance and the meaningfulness of participation in sports. The scientific and research-based foundations for sport psychology must be acknowledged and expanded. Sport psychologists should provide to coaches and athletes services that offer sound educational programs and coping skills, as well as a variety of therapeutic strategies. Problems involving athletes include: (1) Young athletes, to be a part of school life, must have the fundamental skills to be competitive academically as well as athletically; (2) Athletes competing in the "minor" sports often suffer from the same anxiety, fear, academic and personal stress faced by athletes participating in the "major" team sports; (3) The recruiting activities of coaches for college team sports can elicit traumatic reactions from young athletes; (4) The increased activity of women in competitive sports causes new stressors in the lives of girls; and (5) Coaches and officials, as well as young athletes, are increasingly subject to burnout.

AB - Values in gymnastics are discussed from anthropological, sociological, psychological, and physiological perspectives, which point out the instinctive basis of gymnastic activity and the objectives common to all physical education activities--physical courage, determination, perseverence, self-respect, self-reliance, and empathy. The historical development of gymnastics is traced from the arboreal activities of proto-man up through the Olympic Games of the 20th century. The common characteristics of children, teaching principles, anatomical, kinesiological, and physiological principles, and methods of class organization are offered as guides in the conduct of gymnastics class activities. Personal qualities and responsibilities of a coach are described in detail. Self-testing skills, contests, and relays are presented as conditioning exercises. A progressive program of skills and safety procedures is outlined for elementary, secondary, and college students; and international level skills for men and women are described. Spotting procedures are given for almost all skills. Included are tips on public relations, rules for organizing and judging competitive gymnastic meets, and comments on the future of gymnastics. Appendixes describe appropriate activities for gymnastic exhibitions and demonstrations, provide a "how-to" section for organizing an exhibition group (including samples of necessary documents, such as a constitution, contract agreement, and publicity release), and list suppliers of gymnastic equipment. Over 1,000 illustrations are contained in the book. (MM)

AU - Poindexter, Hally B. W.. 
DA - 1976 
AB - This is a review of concepts based upon scientific evidence and observation that may prove helpful to the athletic coach of any age group, any skill level, either sex, and in any environment. It is written with the belief that athletics should exist for athletes and that the coach should be the person who assists the athlete to gain individual excellence and self-fulfillment through sports. The "ultimate athlete," discussed in this review, needs a coach who knows physiology, body mechanics, learning theory, growth and development, motor learning, and social psychology. Particular concepts and implications of (1) motor development, (2) motor learning, and (3) social psychology relevant to coaching are examined. Concepts of motor development drawn from developmental psychology point out that the athlete is a product of both his heredity and his environment; although heredity sets limits, environment and experience offer avenues for the full development of potential. Further, an individual's readiness to learn a skill is dependent upon physical maturity, neuromuscular abilities, previous experiences, and motivation. Motor development concepts also alert the coach to the fact that there is a period of optimum readiness for the acquisition of certain motor skills. From the areas of motor learning and educational psychology the coach is faced with many concepts with direct implication for the improvement through coaching. A basic concept underlying skill development is that motor learning is a relatively permanent change in motor development and that performance is but a single manifestation for this process of change. Social psychology enlightens understanding of social influences on behavior in the areas of the female athlete, the problem athlete, racial tensions, team morale, crowd behavior, and other athletic problems that arise when people interact with other people.

AB - Eighteen speeches are included in these proceedings of the National Conference on Sports Psychology, held in May 1973. The purposes of the conference were to provide practical applications of psychology in the coaching of sports and to assist sports psychology instructors and men and women coaches as they work with student athletes. The 18 speeches are categorized under six general topics: (a) athletic achievement, (b) behavior, (c) special interests, (d) learning, (e) teaching and coaching, and (f) women in sports. The self-concept of the winner and the relationship of personality to athletic achievement are discussed in the first section. Stimulus, motivation, and aggression are discussed in section 2. In the special interest section, sports psychology is related to football, wrestling, cross-country, and hockey. There are two titles in the fourth section: "Learning and Performance at the High Skill Level" and "Imagery and Affect in Motor Skills." The fifth section includes presentations on teaching sports psychology, developing values through sport, and coaching in an era of individual awareness. The section on women in sports includes a discussion of humanistic psychology applied to coaching women and a presentation on public attitude toward women in sport. (HMD)

AB - It was hypothesized that motivation (power, achievement, or fear of failure) scores would be important variables in predicting coaches' and students' ratings of competitiveness and skill. Female high school students in basketball, tennis, and track and field used a self-peer measurement technique to rate competitiveness and skill. Coaches' ratings of student competitiveness and skill were also obtained. For both criterion variables, coaches' skill rating was found to be the best predictor variable. Self-peer rating was an important predictor of self-peer competitiveness rating but was not a strong predictor of coaches' rating of competitiveness. Of the motive scales, power contributed most significantly to the prediction of both criterion variables. Fear of failure was a good predictor variable for coaches' ratings of competitiveness but was not a good predictor of self-peer rating. The achievement motive was not a good predictor of either criterion. These results are consistent with a previous study of male university athletes. Discrepancies were found in both studies between athletes' self perceptions and coaches' perceptions of competitiveness and skill. (FG)

AB - Leadership characteristics and effectiveness of male and female coaches of high school basketball teams were examined. Eighty-nine varsity basketball coaches were measured by means of established instruments to determine leadership style and behaviors. Five to 12 players from each team also completed a questionnaire concerning coaching behaviors. Career and seasonal winning percentages were used as measures of team effectiveness. One-way analysis of variance procedures were used to compare leadership characteristics of male and female coaches. Multiple regression procedures were employed to examine the relationships between various leader characteristics and effectiveness of teams coached by males and females. Results indicated that male and female coaches display significantly different leader characteristics. However, teams coached by male and female coaches are equally effective in terms of win-loss records. Six tables are included to demonstrate study results. (Author/JMK)

AB - This study investigated the connection between sport, emotion, and psychological health through an examination of the literature on sports participation and psychological health. The review found that while some of the research supports a relationship between psychological well-being and sports participation, some of it is inconclusive. Many methodological issues are present in the literature on both sports participation and exercise. The mixed findings can partially be attributed to poorly established methodology. For instance, the general failure of researchers to adequately define psychological well-being was a major roadblock. Similarly, excessive reliance on survey and questionnaire studies yielded results that were predictable and limited. In the final analysis, four of the seven exercise studies that were examined pointed to a relationship between exercise and well-being. Five of 11 sports participation studies reviewed also showed evidence for a connection. Possible explanations for the mixed findings include poorly defined terms, use of improper measurement tools, and inadequately designed studies. (Contains 42 references.) (JB) (Author/JB)

AU - Rupnow, Allan - Stotlar, David. 
DA - 1982 
LA - English 
AB - A study examined coaches' behavior and classified the types and rates of coaches' behavior by time of athletic season (early or late), win/loss record, and throughout the time frame within a single contest. Subjects included all the volunteer coaches in a 13 team, softball program for 10-12 year old girls. The season consisted of a double round-robin schedule, with no post-season tournaments or all-star games as part of the program. A modified version of an event-recording instrument was used to collect coaching behavior data. The instrument included a total of 10 different behavior categories; among these were 4 categories that dealt with responses directed at opponents or officials, and 2 categories reserved for miscellaneous behaviors. The instrument was comprised of four"positive" and four "negative" behavior categories. An analysis of data revealed that: (1) 99 percent of all feedback was related to performance; (2) only 3 percent of the coaches' behaviors was categorized as negative; and (3) response rate nearly doubled from early season to late season. Subsequent analysis of winning and losing coaches' behavior indicated that statistically significant different profiles could not be established for winning and losing coaches based on type and rate of feedback and that no differences could be established between whether the team was ahead or behind and the rate of feedback behavior.

AU - Unestahl, Lars-Eric. 
DA - 1990 
LA - English 
AB - The acquisition and the application of mental skills in sports and non-sport settings are discussed in this paper. The paper opens with an overview of the situation in Sweden; it is noted that 25% of the Swedish population have used mental training programs and that in the future all Swedes will have experienced such programs, since basic mental training has become part of the curriculum. The research background that led to the development of systematic mental training is discussed, focusing on the investigation of a state of awareness and consciousness appropriate for optimal change and growth and on identification of the right content for mental training. Four areas of mental skills for peak performance are identified: self-image (self-confidence, self-evaluation, and self-esteem); goal-images (knowing where to go and commitment to the goal); attitude (reality-testing and reality-interpretation); and control (to identify, produce, and control mental skills such as relaxation). Examples of sports skills and life skills training are complemented by findings from evaluations. It is concluded that, in a time where the benefits of sport are questioned by an increasing number of people, it should be important to point to the role of sport and mental training as a device for personal growth or as a model for life. Twelve references, and 14 figures illustrating the text are included. (ABL)

AB - A junior team and a masters team of precision skaters in Canada were coached under two conditions. In one condition the coach used a monologue and the skaters were not permitted to ask questions or otherwise interact with the coach. In the other condition the coach interacted in a dialogue with team members. Both teams had significantly higher morale and were significantly more productive in the dialogue condition than in the monologue condition. Also, both teams behaved significantly more unproductively when the leader used a monologue than when she used a dialogue. A democratic style of coaching which engages members of a skating team in a dialogue is likely to be better for both morale and productivity than an autocratic style which directs the team by employing a monologue.

TI - "Badminton Player-Coach" Interactions between Failing Students 
AU - Mascret, Nicolas. 
DA - 2011 
LA - English 
AB - Background: Physical education teachers often use the player-coach dyad in individual opposition sports so that students can obtain information on their actions and then better regulate them. This type of work also develops methodological and social skills. However, the task of observing a partner often poses problems for failing students, who tend to reject it. Purpose: Failing students are known to develop an emotional and meaningful relationship to knowledge. We therefore investigated how a "scholastic form of practice" of badminton might be used to encourage these students to accept and invest in the task of observing their partners. We also evaluated the impact of this investment on the acquisition of motor and methodological skills, as well as the conditions conducive to effective reciprocal peer tutoring in badminton. Participants and setting: Our work focussed on two first-year classes in a French secondary school (Marseilles) with a majority of failing students, i.e. students with academic and behavioural problems. Each class was composed of 16 students, approximately 12 years old, who had never practised badminton. Research design: Each class practised a nearly identical form of badminton during six lessons. Only the relationship between the players and observers differed. The observers had to transcribe the nature of the points scored by the players on a worksheet and then give the players feedback about their performance during coaching sequences. In the "coach" class, the player and his or her observer were teammates: the scores of their respective matches were added together for a total score. In the "observer" class, the player and observer had no special relationship. Data collection: Data were collected on a detailed observation worksheet by an expert observer who identified the parts of the court in which players scored. These results were then compared with the data collected by the students. In addition, all coaching sequences were filmed. Data analysis: The progress made by the two classes in terms of motor and methodological skills was compared between a pre-test and a post-test session using two nonparametric tests: the Wilcoxon test and the Mann-Whitney U test. Findings: The results showed that "coach" class students were much more invested in the observation activity than those of the "observer" class, and their motor and methodological achievements were notably higher. Conclusions: The meaning attributed by failing students to dyad work is dependent on how the work is actually structured by the teacher. The creation of conditions for interaction between students is thus an integral part of the scholastic form of practice built by the physical education teacher. (Contains 1 table and 3 figures.)

TI - Player-Centered Coaching: Enhancing Player Game Sense 
AU - Davies, Nigel. 
DA - 2010 
LA - English 
AB - Learning has been defined in many ways as having a certain degree of overlap with both intelligence and development. From a movement point of view, "learning is defined as a relatively permanent change in a person's capability to execute a motor skill as a result of practice or experience." So learning is a result of an individual interacting with a task (specific activity/goal) and the environment (context). Learning is also indicative of intelligence. In order to enhance learning for players, a coach/teacher needs to provide player-centered experiences which promote positive and appropriate interactions with a variety of tasks and environments. Player-centered experiences are activities which are player driven, enable player empowerment in the decision-making process, foster player ownership of the learning, are inclusive, promote player creativity and experimentation, and are matched to the players' needs and abilities. Player-centered learning decentralizes the control of what is learned and responsibility for how learning occurs. This responsibility shifts to both the individual players and the groups within which they interact and practice. (Contains 3 tables.)

Coaches often wonder (1) from a technical perspective, why is the good performance of athletes during practice sessions not transferred to actual competition; (2) what are the flaws of training designs that cause a performance gap between practice and high-level competition; and (3) what training strategies can be used to remedy these flaws? This article describes common training flaws and how coaches can design practice sessions that will prepare students for real competition. (Contains 1 figure and 1 table.)

AU - Lumpkin, Angela - Stokowski, Sarah. 
DA - 2011

AB - While interscholastic sports help young athletes enhance sport skills, physical fitness, self-discipline, sportsmanship, teamwork, time-management skills, self-confidence, and mental toughness, their benefits actually surpass even these. Interscholastic sports also promote life skills and lessons and enhance academic performance. The National Federation of State High School Associations ([NFHS] 2008) reported that the more than 7,000,000 interscholastic athletes in the United States overall have higher grade-point averages, lower dropout rates, better daily attendance, and fewer discipline problems than nonathletes. Based on the premise that interscholastic sports can positively impact the lives of young athletes, this article emphasizes the importance for coaches to model and teach character traits as they offer specific strategies. High school coaches should teach, model, and reinforce to their athletes that participation in interscholastic sports is a character-building privilege earned by showing respect, playing fair, and striving to win while keeping winning in perspective.

AB - According to the Team Identification-Social Psychological Health Model (Wann, 2006b), team identification and social psychological health should be positively correlated because identification leads to important social connections which, in turn, facilitate well-being. Although past research substantiates the hypothesized positive relationship between team identification and well-being, earlier studies focused solely on college student populations. The current study extended past work in this area by investigating the team identification/well-being relationship among older sport fans. A sample of older adults (N = 96; M age = 70.82) completed scales assessing demographics, identification with a local college basketball team, and measures of social psychological well-being. As hypothesized, team identification accounted for a significant proportion of unique variance in two measures of social psychological health (collective self-esteem and loneliness).

In this study, an item displayed DIF if coaches from different groups were more or less likely to endorse that item once coaches were matched on the efficacy of interest, where Motivation, Game Strategy, Technique, and Character Building efficacies defined coaching efficacy. Coach gender and level coached were selected as the grouping variables. None of the Technique and Character Building items exhibited DIF based on coach gender or level coached. One of the Motivation items and one of the Game Strategy items exhibited DIF based on coach gender. Two of the Motivation items exhibited DIF based on level coached.

AB - To investigate whether coaches encourage their athletes to use imagery, two studies were undertaken. In the first, 317 athletes completed the Coaches' Encouragement of Athletes' Imagery Use Questionnaire. In the second, 215 coaches completed a slightly modified version of this questionnaire. It was found that coaches and athletes generally agreed on the relative frequency with which coaches encourage athletes to use imagery across the 4 Ws (i.e., where, when, why, and what). Coaches promoted imagery use more in conjunction with competition than training and injury rehabilitation, and higher-level coaches encouraged imagery use far more than their recreational counterparts. In addition, the level of athlete being coached had a major impact on how much or little coaches encouraged their athletes to use imagery. Coaches encouraged higher level athletes (i.e., international, national, varsity) to use imagery more than club and recreational athletes. (Contains 4 tables and 1 note.)

AB - In a recent issue of "Quest," Seifried (2008) explicitly depicted his work as an "attempt to present some rationale for supporting the use by coaches of corporal punishment in the sport setting... [and] to develop a defense, not previously offered, for those coaches who thoughtfully employ punishment strategies to manage their players and teams" (p. 372). Throughout the article arguments supporting and defending punishment were artfully woven together by relying on the selective use of theory and conjecture rather than empirical sport research or practical coaching experiences. Not surprisingly, the author arrived at his foregone conclusion that corporal punishment is an appropriate, even desirable, means of controlling athlete behavior. Such an endorsement of punishment is not only misleading but diametrically opposes the well-considered official positions of our professional physical education and sport organizations, which have uniformly condemned the use of corporal punishment as a legitimate strategy to "manage players and teams."

Minuchin's (1974) Structural Family Therapy as a heuristic model for conceptualizing and intervening with athletic teams.

TI - What Great Coaches Do Differently: 11 Elements of Effective Coaching 
AU - Haworth, Rob - Whitaker, Todd. 
DA - 2010 
LA - English 
AB - Why do some athletic coaches succeed every season while others suffer loss after loss? This book describes the beliefs, behaviors, and attitudes of great athletic coaches. Where do they focus their attention? How do they spend their time and energy? And how can others gain the same advantages? Here, Rob Haworth and Todd Whitaker describe the qualities of champion athletes, coaches, and parents. Applying and extending the concepts presented in Whitaker's "What Great Teachers Do Differently" and "What Great Principals Do Differently," this book demonstrates how effective coaching calls for "people skills" that the best coaches practice every day.

TI - Coaching Peripheral Vision Training for Soccer Athletes 
AU - Marques, Nelson Kautzner, Jr.. 
DA - 2010 
LA - English 
AB - Brazilian Soccer began developing its current emphasis on peripheral vision in the late 1950s, by initiative of coach of the Canto do Rio Football Club, in Niteroi, Rio de Janeiro, a pioneer in the development of peripheral vision training in soccer players. Peripheral vision training gained world relevance when a young talent from Canto do Rio, become the 1970 World Cup midfielder for Brazil and played an important part in the league's victory that year. Peripheral vision became essential for the short and long passes, both at the start and the development of an offense, for soccer players in Brazil. In 1999, this type of training became known as "peripheral vision training". The purpose of this paper was to teach peripheral vision training for the coach. The article has two chapters. The first chapter explicated the hemisphericity and second taught Tactical Periodization, the types of training with the practice of the neuromotor learning for the soccer team and explicated match analysis (quality of game and use of the peripheral vision). In conclusion, peripheral vision training is an important session for the soccer team, but needs of research for the science discovers the advantages of this training.

AU - Seifried, Chad. 
DA - 2010 
LA - English 
AB - Dr. Rick Albrecht's article, titled "Drop and Give Us 20, Seifried: A Practical Response to Defending the Use of Punishment by Coaches," argued that I held a disregard for the unintended negative consequences of punishment and pointed out several items of concern he felt obligated to communicate to the scholarly and professional community to support this notion (Albrecht, 2009). While several of the issues he brought to our attention deserve merit, in this reply, I focus my counter on Albrecht's assertion that corporal punishment under my definition is "fatally flawed" and outside the mainstream of coaching (p. 474). I also discuss the cultural differences and expectations between the classroom and competitive athletics to help develop the issue. Finally, I offer advice to him and other members of the scholarly coaching education fraternity on how to better reduce the disconnect between them and real practicing coaches.

LA - English 
AB - We evaluated several behavioral coaching procedures for improving offensive line pass-blocking skills with 5 high school varsity football players. Pass blocking was measured during practice drills and games, and our intervention included descriptive feedback with and without video feedback and teaching with acoustical guidance (TAG). Intervention components and pass blocking were evaluated in a multiple baseline design, which showed that video feedback and TAG were the most effective procedures. For all players, improved pass blocking matched a standard derived by observing more experienced linemen and was evident in games. Additional intervention was required to maintain pass-blocking proficiency. Issues pertinent to behavioral coaching and sport psychology research are discussed. (Contains 2 tables and 1 figure.)

AB - This article introduces the physical education, recreation, and health practitioner to the relevant practical and theoretical information pertaining to sportsmanship in youth sports. It discusses four key areas related to sportsmanship: (1) constructs, (2) underlying theories, (3) empirical evidence, and (4) application and education. It also presents an integrated review of the sportsmanship literature and current research regarding the definitions, benefits of moral education, and the influence of coaches, parents, and peers. The practitioner's roles in educating and assisting athletes, coaches, officials, and parents about sportsmanship issues, such as the pressure to overemphasize winning, are examined. The authors highlight the need for a systematic intervention of youth sport organizations and advocate a multidimensional team approach to enhance sportsmanship, with the practitioner being a key member of that team.

AB - Coaching is a dynamic field in which many forms of health promotion occur directly and indirectly on a daily basis. It would therefore be of interest to determine the extent to which research-based data has been collected pertaining to health promotion and its influence throughout coaching. Thus, the purpose of this study was to inductively analyze research-based data pertaining to health promotion in coaching to discover the major topics and the extent to which research has been performed in this area. An extensive online database search revealed 13 articles directly pertaining to health promotion in coaching which were ultimately categorized by (a) year; (b) research methods; (c) author continent of origin; (d) publication outlets; (e) research focus; and (f) data collection methods. The three themes that were isolated from the limited research studies of health promotion in the coaching profession included (1) the coaches' ability to increase athlete chemical health (n = 7); (2) the effects coaches can have on an athletes' physical and psychological well-being (n = 4); and (3) the need for more educational efforts to help coaches learn about the negative athlete behaviors that are highly preventable (n = 2).

LA - English 
AB - Purpose: Coaches leave an indelible mark on all their athletes by striving to exemplify the highest moral character, behaviour and leadership. Coaching is said to be as much an art as a science, and demands creativity and individual interpretation of people and situations. The aim of this study was to present the educational system for training coaches in Greece. Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on a review of the literature and Greek sports legislation. Findings: It was found that the occupation of coaching can be practised in Greece by: graduates of the five departments of Physical Education and Sports Science; holders of a certificate or diploma from coaching schools in foreign countries accredited by the Greek Centre of Sport Research and Technology; and holders of a certificate or diploma from special schools set up by the General Secretariat for Sport. The results showed significant differences regarding the institution which issue coaching diplomas, duration of coach training periods and source of the official and legal licence given. Originality/value: The study provides useful information on the Greek system of training and educating coaches, the duration of their studies, the category, and the teaching staff.

AB - The present study examined links between physical activity and quality of life experienced by individuals with physical disabilities recruited from a wheelchair user's basketball tournament. The participants included 12 male and 14 female adults between the ages of 18-54 (M = 31.12, SD = 10.75) who all reported one or more condition(s) that impacted their daily living. They were administered the Physical Activity Scale for Individuals with Physical Disabilities (Washburn, Weimo, McAuley, Frogley, & Figoni, 2002) and in-depth interviews focused on their physical activity experiences and evaluations about their quality of life. Grounded theory analyses (Charmaz, 2000, 2002) revealed that individuals who use wheelchairs perceived a number of psychological, social, and health benefits associated with physical activity involvement. The participants' evaluations and descriptions of their physical activity experiences appeared to support self-efficacy beliefs, feelings of empowerment, and motivation for continued involvement. First-person descriptions are presented to demonstrate how and why physical activity behaviors were perceived to enhance the quality of the participants' lives.

AB - Black student-athletes have been the focus of study regarding academic and psychosocial adjustment to college since the 1960s. Although recent literature generally reports higher graduation rates for Black student-athletes compared to their nonathlete peers, little attention has been given to their psychosocial experiences on predominantly White college campuses. The current study explored the social experiences of a small group of Black football players attending a predominantly White university in the northeastern United States. A qualitative "grounded theory" methodology was employed for data collection and analysis and a coding system was created centered on the main areas of team, campus, and city experiences. Findings revealed that the Black players felt isolated, rejected, and mistrustful of their Black and White classmates and teammates. They also felt unfairly judged by their coaches and campus community. Other team, campus, and city issues were revealed, all of which negatively influenced these players' emotional and educational experiences. Implications for recruitment, retention, and educational policy are discussed. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB - The aim of this study was to evaluate the differences in psychological well-being, symptomatic psychological disorders and social participation, between blind Torball players and non-players. Thirty blind male participants were recruited, 17 Torball players (aged 36.27 plus or minus 3.46) and 13 non-players (aged 34.80 plus or minus 2.53), and evaluated for social participation level, psychological well-being and symptomatic psychological disorders, using three validated self-report questionnaires: Participation Scale (PS), Psychological Well-Being Scale (PWBS) and Symptom Checklist 90 R (SCL-90-R) respectively. ANOVA showed significant overall differences between the two groups. The social restriction score in the non-player group was significantly higher (p less than 0.01) than the player group. The Torball player group showed significant better scores than non-player group in 5 of the 6 dimensions of the PWB Scale (p less than 0.01) and in 8 of the 10 dimensions of the SCL-90-R (7 dimensions p less than 0.01; 1 dimension p less than 0.05) and in the three global scores of the SCL-90-R (p less than 0.01). The results of this study showed a relationship between psychological well-being and social skills of visually impaired people and their Torball practice. (Contains 3 tables.)

AB - Simplicity, as espoused by American philosopher Henry David Thoreau, is a method of removing unnecessary obstacles, a tangible means to attain a higher life, one of crystallization and transcendence. A complex profession such as coaching stands to greatly benefit from this concept. The purpose of this paper is to apply simplicity to coaching. A number of themes emerge, conditions that would facilitate the move towards simplicity. These conditions include freedom of choice, self-discipline, continual attention, reflection, and the use of exemplars. When these conditions are met, coaches may rid themselves of common coaching complexities--the quest for more, responsibilities, and distractions. By doing so they may move towards and experience simplicity in their coaching.

AB - For years, strong claims have been made that sport builds character. Despite such claims, a "winning at all cost" mentality can frequently be seen within all of sport. The reason for this paradox may relate to confusion around what it means to demonstrate character. The purpose of this article is to show that there are indeed two distinct types of character that are espoused in the sport milieu. One type is related to social values (social character) the other related to moral values (moral character). Following an explication and comparison of these types of character, a recommendation is made for a needed emphasis towards the development of moral character.

TI - Tennis: Applied Examples of a Game-Based Teaching Approach 
AU - Crespo, Miguel - Reid, Machar M. - Miley, Dave. 
DA - 2004 
LA - English 
AB - In this article, the authors reveal that tennis has been increasingly taught with a tactical model or game-based approach, which emphasizes learning through practice in match-like drills and actual play, rather than in practicing strokes for exact technical execution. Its goal is to facilitate the player's understanding of the tactical, physical and psychological challenges of the game. Integrating technique coaching into game situations gives players the opportunity to experience the manner in which technique may be performed more effectively. Therefore, when players play, they should focus on the tactical intentions and the biomechanics, and see technique as a means of performing the tactic more effectively. These recommendations on new teaching methods can be used with players at all levels of performance. Here, the authors advise that physical educators and coaches use these modern teaching techniques for better performance and to the satisfaction of their players. (Contains 5 tables.)

AB - Most athletes can benefit from practicing and using mental skills within a sport context, but budgets do not always allow the hiring of a Sport Psychologists to implement a mental skills training program. With guidance, however, dedicated coaches can help athletes develop the mental side of their game by providing basic psychological skills. A simple psychological skills training tool called Psychological UNIFORM, developed by these authors, can help coaches assist young athletes from ages 8 to 18. UNIFORM is an acronym for seven skills: (1) Use goal setting; (2) No mistakes, only learning opportunities; (3) Imagery; (4) Full focus; (5) Overtly positive; (6) Relaxation; and (7) Make routines. These skills can assist young athletes in achieving higher levels of performance by improving their mental outlooks. The authors state that although it will take time to develop these psychological UNIFORM skills, the time invested will be well spent, particularly when coaches and athletes realize increased gains in self-confidence and performance levels.

AU - Osteen, Deborah E. - Phillips, Dennis.

LA - English 
AB - Coaches and sports psychologists often say that it is the mind that controls the body, and that once a race begins, it is 90 percent mental and 10 percent physical training. Teaching young athletes to use mental strategies is a skill they will continue to use throughout their athletic career, and best of all, throughout their everyday lives, even in non-athletic atmospheres. This article describes the Running Values Auction which is a fun team activity that will give the athletes an opportunity to reflect on their current values, priorities, and mental racing strategies. It can also be used as an introductory to many mental training strategies that can be beneficial to athletes such as relaxation, imagery rehearsal, self-talk, and goal-setting. The items in the Running Values Auction are targeted to runners and the discussion questions focus on the racing strategies of runners. This activity is most appropriate for a group ranging from five to 10 members. A large team can be broken into several groups. Moreover, this activity can also be tailored to the different needs of various sports such as volleyball, football, and even basketball, by simply changing the items in the auction to suit the sport.

Findings revealed that (1) a variety of different practice regimens can result in attaining expertise, and (2) highly analogous developmental experiences may not differentiate between elite and sub-elite performers. Results provide support for a 4-factor model of expert athletic development: high effort, supportive environment, facilitative coping strategies, and physical and psychological predispositions. Each is likely required to achieve elite athletic performance, and all must be present in such a manner that they are systematically and idiosyncratically functional.

Two hundred and fifty-six coaches participated in this study with comparisons drawn by gender, highest level of participation, formal coaching training, years of experience, and officiating experience. Participants completed a 25-statement survey. The survey consisted of 25 gamesmanship statements that asked subjects to indicate if an action was clearly acceptable (1), acceptable (2), unacceptable (3), or clearly unacceptable (4). Chronbach&apos;s Alpha measure (a=0.938) indicated a high consistency and reliability for the statements on the survey instrument. A crosstabs analysis provided Pearson Chi-Square or Fischer Exact tests to identify statistical significance within the variables. For all of the statements, a majority of respondents identified the statements as either unacceptable or clearly unacceptable. In addition, there were very few significant differences based on gender, highest level of participation, years of coaching experience, formal coaching education, or officiating experience.

AB - Two unique methodological strategies were used to investigate the influence of retroactive inhibition on recall within a contextual interference paradigm. Three independent blocked groups, blocked without retroactive inhibition (BL-without), blocked with 18 trials of retroactive inhibition (BL-18), and blocked with 36 trials of retroactive inhibition (BL-36), were created that varied in order of presentation of tasks. By testing a single task in retention and creating three independent blocked groups, varying amounts of retroactive inhibition were produced. This isolated the effects of retroactive inhibition on blocked compared to control and random subjects' retention. The Acquisition Group x Retention Trials interaction indicated that random and BL-without subjects had shorter reaction time than BL-18 and BL-36 subjects. Thus, blocked subjects with retroactive inhibition exhibited a retention deficit compared to BL-without subjects. The results support previous contextual interference findings and suggest that retroactive inhibition influences the retention deficits demonstrated by blocked compared to random subjects in typical contextual interference investigations.

To date, empirical research on the martial arts has lacked sophistication in the questions it has posed and in the methodology adopted to answer them. Whilst not entirely consistent, findings from studies of martial artists' personalities, outlooks and behaviour have generally indicated positive psychological effects of training. Clinical and psychotherapeutic applications are at an exploratory stage but appear promising. As an exemplar the psychological facets of the art of Aikido are discussed, and prospective uses of martial arts principles as systemic or adjunctive therapies are considered.

AU - Dommisse, J. 
DA - 1986 
LA - English 
AB - The notorious governmental policy of Apartheid affects the people of that country psychologically, as well as politically, socially, economically and medically. It does so in a variety of ways, including: the humiliating effects on blacks and arrogance inducing effects on whites; the disruption of family-life by the enforced migrant labor system; the stunted brain-development and behavioral effects that result from the inexcusably widespread childhood malnutrition in that wealthy country, (the world's 6th-largest food-exporter); the distortions and alienations in personality development, on racial lines; the mental breakdowns and suicides that result from the physical and mental torture that unchanged security-police detainees are subjected to while under interrogation. In addition, when mental health services are required they are grossly inferior for blacks, especially in the rural areas and particularly in out-patient care. The white-doctor: black-patient relationship, perforce the rule, is distinctly problematic in this socio-political climate. The World Medical Association and the World Psychiatric Association have been supportive to the South African government and silent, respectively, in the face of all the documented information on this hazardous public health situation. The United Nations and its agencies, the World Health Organization and the Centre Against Apartheid, should be commended for their work and unequivocal stands on this issue and should be heeded in their calls for a principled response by more of the world's psychiatric, psychological and medical communities.

AB - The purpose of the present study was to reveal possible neurological sequelae of amateur boxing after the introduction of modern medical supervision and safety precautions. Neurological, electroencephalographic and neuropsychological examinations were performed in a total of 53 former champion amateur boxers together with a control group consisting of 53 former football players. The football players were, on an average, better educated than the boxers, but otherwise the two groups were comparable. Complaints, neurological findings and electroencephalographic changes were identical in the boxers and control group. Only minor neuropsychological disturbances were found in the boxers most pronounced in impaired motor function of the left hand. This was further demonstrated by comparing 19 pairs, each consisting of one boxer and one football player, matched according to age, education and vocabulary. No relation between abnormal findings and "occupational exposure" during the boxing career could be demonstrated, not even by comparing three pairs of identical twins, although in each twin of the pairs there was a great difference in the number of fights. This study provides no basis for legislation against amateur boxing at the present time, as it indicates that the existing safety precautions protect the boxers against serious and permanent brain damage.

AB - This research examines relationships between different forms of aerobic exercise (swim, walk, jog, dance) and two measures of health: subjective health and psychological well-being. We hypothesize that the relationship between aerobic exercise and subjective health/well-being will be notably stronger for older than younger persons and females than males. This prediction is based on Homans' exchange theory of investments and rewards. Since social norms concerning aerobic exercise are likely to be weaker among older (than younger) persons and among women than men, older persons and women who do exercise are making special investments and should expect greater rewards (good health). The concept of 'exercise norms' implies social comparisons with others. Accordingly, age comparative data were analyzed to see if older persons who exercise see themselves as more active than their age peers than do younger persons. Data come from a national probability sample of 3025 adults (National Survey of Personal Health Practices and Consequences). As predicted, exercise was much more strongly related to subjective health and well-being among older than younger respondents. In the main, the gender hypothesis was not supported.

AB - Findings of previous studies suggest that the relationship between physical activity and mental health may change across different domains of physical activity, different dimensions of mental health, and different population subgroups. The present study examined associations between five types of physical activity with different contents: housework, leisure active transportation, biking to/from work, walking to/from work, and sports participation, and two dimensions of mental health: perceived stress and psychological distress, in 1919 participants aged 20-65 years, using the data from the Flemish Policy Research Centre Sport, Physical Activity and Health. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed with the total sample, and with the sample stratified by gender, age, and occupational category. Further, separate models were used in the gender and age subgroups of each occupational category. Sports participation was the only type of physical activity inversely associated with both stress (OR=0.375; CI: 0.200-0.704) and distress (OR=0.480; CI: 0.253-0.910). Sports participation related to less distress in unemployed mid-aged adults, and to less stress in unemployed women, unemployed young adults, and young adults with blue-collar jobs. Housework was associated with more stress and more distress in women with blue-collar jobs. In young adults with white-collar jobs, however, an inverse association between housework and distress was found. Biking to and from work was associated with more stress in men with blue-collar jobs. Results invite consideration for the utility, and perhaps the necessity, of differentiated health recommendations for physical health and for mental health in different population subgroups.

AB - Prior studies have indicated that post-encoding stress can protect memories from the effects of forgetting, and this has been taken as evidence that stress facilitates memory consolidation. However, it is not known whether stress acts by directly influencing the strength of the underlying memories or whether it influences the generation process that plays a critical role in tests such as free recall. To address this issue, we examined the effects of stress produced by skydiving on recognition memory for negative and neutral pictures. Relative to a non-stress control condition, post-encoding stress in males was found to increase recognition memory for neutral pictures. However, stress was not found to improve recognition for emotional pictures, nor was it found to influence recognition memory in female participants. Additional analysis of recognition performance suggested that stress increased familiarity-based recognition rather than recollection. This study indicates that stress can improve familiarity-based recognition, thus showing that stress directly increases the strength of the underlying memories.

AB - The unique physiological attributes of marathoners have long been recognised, but until the pioneering research of Morgan and Pollock (1977) little was known about their psychological characteristics. Their work revealed marathoners have significantly better mental health compared with non-athletes, with desirable mental health variables being most pronounced in elite competitors. It was also found that during competition, elite marathoners typically utilise a unique cognitive strategy labelled 'association', whereby they regulate pace based upon bodily sensations including pain and effort. More recent research indicates there are considerable individual differences in the psychological responses of marathoners to the stressors associated with training and competition, and in some cases negative emotions traditionally presumed to be harmful actually benefit performance. This brief review will highlight findings of psychological research involving marathoners and other endurance athletes, distinguishing between characteristics common among groups (i.e. nomothetic) with those particular to individuals (i.e. ideographic) or sub-groups of elite and non-elite competitors.

AB - This study examined the reliability of a retrospective recall methodology for providing evidence of deliberate imagery practice. A secondary purpose was to determine which imagery activities constituted the sport-specific definition of deliberate practice (Starkes, Deakin, Allard, Hodges, & Hayes, 1996). Ninety-three Canadian athletes from one of three different competitive levels (regional, provincial, and national) completed the Deliberate Imagery Practice Recall Questionnaire, which was specifically designed for the present study. The athletes also completed a 1-week imagery diary to assess their use of 14 different imagery activities. The results of the study indicated that the athletes were able to reliably estimate their use of imagery over a short recall interval. Four imagery activities were also determined to fulfill the sport specific definition of deliberate practice.

AB - The purpose of this article was to provide a brief historical perspective of the psychological factors that affect the potential for athletic injury, the psychological variables that affect recovery from injury, and the increasing pressure athletes face to return to play as soon as possible following an injury. DATA SOURCES/METHODS: A literature search was conducted using SportDiscus with keywords athlete, injury, sport psychology, and return to play. Further support for the literature cited and conclusions comes from more than 16 years of collegial consultations and direct clinical experience with multiple collegiate, Olympic, and professional sport organizations. Although the primary body of research regarding the psychological factors affecting sport injury and return to play is found in studies conducted in the 1980s, more recent research continues to support many of the original findings. Additionally, the applied experience of a full-time licensed and practicing sport psychologist is consistent with the early and subsequent research. Research, supported by applied experience, has resulted in the development of a set of causative psychological factors that increase the likelihood of sport injury, increase the potential recovery time from injury, and have thus far stood the test of time. One factor, however, that has changed over the years is the increasing pressure that elite athletes experience in returning to play much more quickly following an injury. Awareness of this increasing pressure is an important consideration for health care providers and sport organizations to ensure that athletes return medically and psychologically ready to play.

DA - 2004 
LA - English 
AB - Recent theoretical and empirical work in cognitive science and neuroscience is brought into contact with the concept of the flow experience. After a brief exposition of brain function, the explicit-implicit distinction is applied to the effortless information processing that is so characteristic of the flow state. The explicit system is associated with the higher cognitive functions of the frontal lobe and medial temporal lobe structures and has evolved to increase cognitive flexibility. In contrast, the implicit system is associated with the skill-based knowledge supported primarily by the basal ganglia and has the advantage of being more efficient. From the analysis of this flexibility/efficiency trade-off emerges a thesis that identifies the flow state as a period during which a highly practiced skill that is represented in the implicit system's knowledge base is implemented without interference from the explicit system. It is proposed that a necessary prerequisite to the experience of flow is a state of transient hypofrontality that enables the temporary suppression of the analytical and meta-conscious capacities of the explicit system. Examining sensory-motor integration skills that seem to typify flow such as athletic performance, writing, and free-jazz improvisation, the new framework clarifies how this concept relates to creativity and opens new avenues of research.

AB - Although the parent discipline of sport psychology is psychology, the delivery of sport psychology services has its main roots in physical education and sports science (motor learning and control, skill acquisition). Thus, sport psychologists may look more like coaches than they look like clinicians or counselors. In this article, the authors trace the evolution of sport psychology services and contrast the temporal, spatial, and delivery issues of applied sport psychology with more mainstream counseling and clinical psychology. The looser boundaries of sport psychologist practice have both benefits and dangers, and the authors offer some examples to professional psychologists who are thinking of expanding their delivery of service to athletes and coaches.

AB - The Mental Health Model (MHM) of sport performance purports that an inverse relationship exists between psychopathology and sport performance. The model postulates that as an athlete's mental health either worsens or improves performance should fall or rise accordingly, and there is now considerable support for this view. Studies have shown that between 70 and 85% of successful and unsuccessful athletes can be identified using general psychological measures of personality structure and mood state, a level superior to chance but insufficient for the purpose of selecting athletes. Longitudinal MHM research indicates that the mood state responses of athletes exhibit a dose-response relationship with their training load, a finding that has shown potential for reducing the incidence of the staleness syndrome in athletes who undergo intensive physical training. The MHM also has implications for the general care of athletes as support services have traditionally been limited to preventing or treating physical problems. Despite its simple premise and empirical support, the MHM has often been mischaracterised in the sport psychology literature and recently some authors have questioned its validity. This overview will summarise MHM research, including the more recent work involving the model's dynamic features in an effort to resolve disputes surrounding the model.

AB - This paper builds on recent theoretical concerns regarding traditional conceptualizations of the skill acquisition process. The implications for the process of practice in sport contexts are explored with reference to the information-processing approach to motor behaviour and the newer ecological paradigm. Issues are raised with current principles of practice based on traditional theoretical ideas. A practice strategy that gives greater weight to the guided exploration of the practice workspace jointly defined by the properties of the individual's subsystems, the specific task and the environment is advocated. Such a constraints-led perspective supersedes previous distinctions between rudimentary and voluntary skills. Sports scientists, coaches, teachers and movement rehabilitation therapists are invited to review current practices in the light of recent theoretical advances from the ecological perspective.

AB - The visual system has developed to transform an undifferentiated and continuous flow of information into discrete and manageable representations, and this ability rests primarily on the uninterrupted nature of the input. Here we explore the impact of altering how visual information is accumulated over time by assessing how intermittent vision influences memory retention. Previous work has shown that intermittent, or stroboscopic, visual training (i.e., practicing while only experiencing snapshots of vision) can enhance visual-motor control and visual cognition, yet many questions remain unanswered about the mechanisms that are altered. In the present study, we used a partial-report memory paradigm to assess the possible changes in visual memory following training under stroboscopic conditions. In Experiment 1, the memory task was completed before and immediately after a training phase, wherein participants engaged in physical activities (e.g., playing catch) while wearing either specialized stroboscopic eyewear or transparent control eyewear. In Experiment 2, an additional group of participants underwent the same stroboscopic protocol but were delayed 24 h between training and assessment, so as to measure retention. In comparison to the control group, both stroboscopic groups (immediate and delayed retest) revealed enhanced retention of information in short-term memory, leading to better recall at longer stimulus-to-cue delays (640-2,560 ms). These results demonstrate that training under stroboscopic conditions has the capacity to enhance some aspects of visual memory, that these faculties generalize beyond the specific tasks that were trained, and that trained improvements can be maintained for at least a day.

AB - The purpose of the present research is to present a model pertaining to the mediating roles of rumination and recovery experiences in the relationship between a harmonious and an obsessive passion (Vallerand et?al., 2003) for work and workers' emotional exhaustion. Two populations were measured in the present research: namely elite coaches and nurses. Study 1's model posits that obsessive passion positively predicts rumination about one's work when being physically away from work, while harmonious passion negatively predicts ruminative thoughts. In turn, rumination is expected to positively contribute to emotional exhaustion. The results of Study 1 were replicated in Study 2. In addition, in the model of Study 2, obsessive passion was expected to undermine recovery experiences, while harmonious passion was expected to predict recovery experiences. In turn, recovery experiences were expected to protect workers from emotional exhaustion. Results of both studies provided support for the proposed model. The present findings demonstrate that passion for work may lead to some adaptive and maladaptive psychological processes depending on the type of passion that is prevalent. © 2012 The Authors.

AB - The aim of this study was to evaluate the differences in psychological well-being, symptomatic psychological disorders and social participation, between blind Torball players and non-players. Thirty blind male participants were recruited, 17 Torball players (aged 36.27±3.46) and 13 non-players (aged 34.80±2.53), and evaluated for social participation level, psychological well-being and symptomatic psychological disorders, using three validated self-report questionnaires: Participation Scale (PS), Psychological Well-Being Scale (PWBS) and Symptom Checklist 90 R (SCL-90-R) respectively. ANOVA showed significant overall differences between the two groups. The social restriction score in the non-player group was significantly higher (p<0.01) than the player group. The Torball player group showed significant better scores than non-player group in 5 of the 6 dimensions of the PWB Scale (p<0.01) and in 8 of the 10 dimensions of the SCL-90-R (7 dimensions p<0.01; 1 dimension p<0.05) and in the three global scores of the SCL-90-R (p<0.01). The results of this study showed a relationship between psychological well-being and social skills of visually impaired people and their Torball practice. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB - Factors relevant to the working alliance between athletes and sport psychology consultants were investigated in a sample of elite Malaysian athletes (n = 217). The athletes represented a variety of team and individual sports, and they provided information about the perceived importance of seven consultant characteristics/behaviors as well as seven program delivery options. At a full-sample level, general preferences were expressed for consultants to lead a physically active lifestyle, regularly attend training sessions and competitions, and have prior experience as an athlete or coach. General preferences were also expressed for program content to be determined by the coach or consultant, and for regular, small doses of mental skills training to be delivered in a face-to-face context throughout the year. At a sub-group level, team sport athletes had stronger preferences than individual sport athletes for program delivery on a group/team basis, while individual sport athletes had stronger preferences than team sport athletes for having a role in determining program content. Findings are discussed in relation to dominant value themes within Malaysian society and the reinforcement of these themes within specific sport subcultures. Key pointsConsultant characteristics and program delivery methods have an impact on the effectiveness of sport psychology services.Preferred consultant characteristics and preferred methods of delivery may be affected by cultural and subcultural values.Elite Malaysian athletes prefer consultants to lead a physically active lifestyle; to regularly attend training/competition; and to have prior experience as an athlete or coach.Elite Malaysian athletes also prefer that the coach or consultant determine program content, and that mental skills training take place in a face-to-face context throughout the year.

AB - In the last few decades, therapeutic horse-riding has become recognized as a progressive form of therapy, particularly for people with disabilities. Although there is a substantial amount of literature that supports the physical benefit of therapeutic riding, only anecdotal evidence exists in relation to its psychological benefits. The purpose of this article is to develop hypotheses about the mechanisms by which therapeutic riding might have a beneficial psychological effect. These hypotheses can then be tested, leading to a more detailed knowledge base. PsychINFO, MEDLINE, PROQUEST, Scopus, Web of Science, and CINAHL. Data sources were searched for studies that (a) were related to the psychological effects of therapeutic horse-riding, (b) focused exclusively on therapeutic horse-riding, (c) described, explicitly or implicitly, the mechanism by which therapeutic riding had a beneficial psychological effect. Studies were limited to those published between 2008 and 2012. Data were extracted by two authors independently. Thirty articles met the inclusion criteria. Three potential hypotheses emerged from the literature, namely, (1) the psychological benefits of therapeutic riding are actually unrelated to the horse, (2) the horse provides a particularly positive context within which psychological gains are facilitated, and (3) the horse itself has specific therapeutic qualities that bring about unique changes not otherwise likely to occur. The challenge for researchers in this area is to design studies that adequately test these competing hypotheses. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB - Research into mental toughness has largely been confined to elite sport but should theoretically be important across other performance domains. We examined mental toughness in 161 first year sport students at a UK university using a self-report questionnaire (MTQ48). A measure of achievement (year grade) and progression (pass, fail, or re-sit) was also obtained for each participant. Significant and positive correlations were found between total mental toughness, grades, and progression. Results suggest that the MTQ48 may be a useful screening device to identify students at risk of failing and dropping out of their program. Interventions that target life control and interpersonal confidence would appear to be most salient.

AB - The aim of this study was to investigate the higher-order structure of mental toughness and to examine differences in mental toughness between athletes and non-athletes. Participants of this study - 927 athletes and 931 non-athletes - completed a battery of questionnaires designed to assess four characteristics of mental toughness: hope, optimism, perseverance and resilience. The higher-order structure of mental toughness was found to be the same for both athletes and non-athletes. The latent mean differences analyses showed that athletes scored higher in mental toughness when compared to non-athletes. Taken together, these findings support the theoretical assumption that mental toughness is a higher-order construct encompassing different characteristics and that sport participation is associated with higher mental toughness.

AB - Our previous research showed that mental tasks that involve program running (RUN tasks), e.g. performing arithmetic operations, cause greater tonic increase in cardiovascular activity than tasks that require a search for problem solutions (EDIT tasks), e.g. logical completion of a series of digits. However, it was not clear what physiological mechanism was responsible for this difference. The aim of the experiment was to compare cardiac response patterns while solving three mental tasks matched for their duration and level of difficulty: a simple RT task (control task) and two numerical tasks: RUN and EDIT. Forty-eight males, university students, divided randomly into three groups (n=16), participated in the experiment. Each group performed a different task. Task-evoked changes in heart rate (HR), strong volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), pre-ejection period (PEP), and power of HF component of heart rate variability were subject of the analysis. The results showed a higher tonic HR increase during the RUN task than the two other tasks and larger shortening of PEP during the RUN than the EDIT task. The HF power was larger during the RT task than the RUN task. No significant between-task difference was found in SV and CO changes. The results seem to support the hypothesis that higher cardiac responsiveness to RUN than EDIT tasks is mainly due to the difference in sympathetic activation.

L'approche énactive, prenant appui sur une phénoménologie cognitive, offre le cadre d'une analyse de l'activité des entraîneurs en situation, c'est-à-dire des significations qui émergent des situations dont ils font l'expérience. L'étude révèle que les processus cognitifs à l'?uvre en cours d'intervention sont métaphoriquement ancrés dans l'expérience corporelle des entraîneurs. L'intelligibilité qu'ils développent du mouvement gymnique au cours des interactions d'enseignement/apprentissage relève de processus fictionnels qui font émerger des mondes possibles de description des habiletés gymniques qui s'ajustent aux situations afin d'améliorer l'efficacité des interventions qui s'y déroulent.

AB - In various domains, experts are found to possess elaborate domain-specific representations they developed over years. In this study, we provide the first systematic attempt to characterise the short-term representations among individuals with different expertise levels. We showed videos of soccer game plays to expert, near-expert and non-expert soccer players and asked them to describe the actions taking place. Verbalisations were coded based on Fischer's Skill Theory. Monte Carlo permutation tests revealed that players with higher expertise constructed representations of higher complexity (regardless of their specific content). Taking the content of the representations into account, we found that higher expertise soccer players relatively more often included high complexity levels of actions not including the ball and (moving) players on the field. These findings improve our understanding of perceptual-cognitive expertise by demonstrating how actors with different levels of expertise integrate the information they perceive to construct their representations in real time.

AB - Athletes and their coach interpret the training situations differently and this can have important implications for the development of an elite athlete's performance. It is argued that, from a schema-theoretic perspective, the difference in these interpretations needs to be better understood. A post-performance, self-confrontation, interview was conducted with a number of athletes and their coaches. The interviews revealed differences between the athlete and their coach in the information they are aware of. In comparison with athletes, coaches more frequently compared the phenotype with genotype schemata rather than just describing the phenotype schemata. Results suggest SA information elements showed some common ground but also revealed some important differences between the athlete and coach. The awareness was directed externally towards the environment and internally, towards the individual, depending on his/her role. The investigation showed that the schemata used to 'frame' the information elements were different, but compatible, between athlete and coach.

AB - This experiment investigated the relationship between mental rotation and sport training. Undergraduate university students (n = 62) completed the Mental Rotation Test (Vandenberg & Kuse, 1978), before and after a 10-month training in two different sports, which either involved extensive mental rotation ability (wrestling group) or did not (running group). Both groups showed comparable results in the pretest, but the wrestling group outperformed the running group in the posttest. As expected from previous studies, males outperformed women in the pretest and the posttest. Besides, self-reported data gathered after both sessions indicated an increase in adaptive strategies following training in wrestling, but not subsequent to training in running. These findings demonstrate the significant effect of training in particular sports on mental rotation performance, thus showing consistency with the notion of cognitive plasticity induced from motor training involving manipulation of spatial representations. They are discussed within an embodied cognition framework.

AB - Depuis quelques années, les nouvelles technologies de l'information et de la communication n'ont cessé de se développer. Ainsi, la nature de certaines activités s'en est trouvée modifiée. Tel est le cas des jeux de hasard et d'argent qui sont passés des environnements de jeux au domicile du sujet. Ce changement dans les caractéristiques situationnelles des jeux de hasard et d'argent (une accessibilité à la maison, 24/24 h) combiné à certaines caractéristiques structurelles (notamment l'accessibilité et la fréquence de l'évènement) inquiètent beaucoup de professionnels. Quelles sont et quelles vont être les conséquences de ces modifications? Observera-t-on une augmentation du nombre de joueurs dépendants? De plus, cet accès sans limites pose la question de la protection de certaines populations plus vulnérables (notamment les joueurs déjà dépendants et les adolescents) mais aussi de certaines pratiques peu scrupuleuses de la part des opérateurs de jeu. Par ailleurs, les études de prévalence et les recherches sur le profil des joueurs en ligne restent peu nombreuses et les conclusions vouées à évoluer car le réel impact de l'avènement des jeux de hasard et d'argent sur Internet ne pourra se faire qu'avec le temps et le recul. Les recherches les plus récentes distinguent le type de jeu en ligne auquel le sujet s'adonne de façon préférentielle mais elles tentent également de saisir la signification du choix du lieu du jeu: dans des environnements de jeu ou à la maison. Avec les jeux en ligne, il apparaît primordial de penser les stratégies de réductions des risques pour une pratique socialement responsable.

AB - Our objective was to determine whether the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup in 1998 had a short-term impact on the number of suicides in France. Exhaustive individual daily data on suicides from 1979 to 2006 were obtained from the French epidemiological center on the medical causes of death (CepiDC-INSERM; France). These data were analyzed using the seasonal ARIMA model. The overall effect of the World Cup was tested together with potential specific impact on days following the French team games. Between 11th June and 11 th July, a significant decline of 95 suicides was observed (-10.3%), this effect being the strongest among men and people aged between 30 and 44. A significant decrease was also observed for the days following French team games (-19.9%). Our results are in favor of an effect of nationwide sport events on suicidal behaviors and are consistent with other studies. Many of the theories explaining the relationship between sports and suicide are related to sense of belongingness and social integration, highlighting the importance of social link reinforcement in suicide prevention.

AB - One of the most remarkable capacities of the mind is its ability to simulate sensations, actions, and other types of experience. A mental simulation process that has attracted recent attention from cognitive neuroscientists and sport psychologists is motor imagery or the mental rehearsal of actions without engaging in the actual physical movements involved. Research on motor imagery is important in psychology because it provides an empirical window on consciousness and movement planning, rectifies a relative neglect of non-visual types of mental imagery, and has practical implications for skill learning and skilled performance in special populations (e.g., athletes, surgeons). Unfortunately, contemporary research on motor imagery is hampered by a variety of semantic, conceptual, and methodological issues that prevent cross-fertilization of ideas between cognitive neuroscience and sport psychology. In this paper, we review these issues, suggest how they can be resolved, and sketch some potentially fruitful new directions for inter-disciplinary research in motor imagery.

Dans cette étude, les conduites addictives avec ou sans substance de 354 étudiants et étudiantes ont été évaluées à l'aide du questionnaire des mesures de l'intensité addictive (QMICA) pour six conduites addictives différentes. Si certaines conduites ne diffèrent pas selon le genre, les résultats montrent qu'étudiants et étudiantes semblent respectivement avoir recours de façon privilégiée à certaines conduites, ce qui laisse envisager des actions de prévention et des prises en charge spécifiques.

AB - Based on the premise that what people think influences their actions, self-talk strategies have been developed to direct and facilitate human performance. In this article, we present a meta-analytic review of the effects of self-talk interventions on task performance in sport and possible factors that may moderate the effectiveness of self-talk. A total of 32 studies yielding 62 effect sizes were included in the final meta-analytic pool. The analysis revealed a positive moderate effect size (ES =.48). The moderator analyses showed that self-talk interventions were more effective for tasks involving relatively fine, compared with relatively gross, motor demands, and for novel, compared with well-learned, tasks. Instructional self-talk was more effective for fine tasks than was motivational self-talk; moreover, instructional self-talk was more effective for fine tasks rather than gross tasks. Finally, interventions including self-talk training were more effective than those not including self-talk training. The results of this study establish the effectiveness of self-talk in sport, encourage the use of self-talk as a strategy to facilitate learning and enhance performance, and provide new research directions.

Die Spielerinnen mit hoher Einsatzzeit zeigten sich unter anderem erheblich zufriedener mit der Häufigkeit ihrer Einsätze, ihren Leistungen, ihren Ergebnissen und der Leistungsbewertung durch die Trainer als die Spielerinnen mit niedriger Einsatzzeit. Die Stammspielerinnen waren in stärkerem Maße als die Auswechselspielerinnen der Auffassung, dass sie einen guten Kontakt mit dem Trainer hatten und dass der Trainer durch sein Verhalten den Zusammenhalt der Mannschaft fördern würde. Diese Befunde mit Spielerinnen im Basketball ließen in der Tendenz hohe Ähnlichkeiten mit den Ergebnissen von männlichen Stamm- und Ersatzspielern im Fußball erkennen.

Ziel der Integrationsmaßnahme war es, eine Spielstation für das Internationale Spiel- und Sportfest Heidelberg 1986 vorzubereiten und zu gestalten. Anhand einer empirischen Begleituntersuchung wurde überprüft, inwieweit Lernprozesse in Richtung sozialer Integration stattfanden. Die Ergebnisse aus Befragungen und Verhaltensbeobachtungen zeigten bei den Nichtbehinderten Veränderungen in den Dimensionen Einstellung und Verhalten in die gewünschte prointegrative Richtung. Die Befunde waren statistisch signifikant und auch von unterrichtspraktischer Relevanz. Es wird gefolgert, dass durch gemeinsamen Sportunterricht von Behinderten und Nichtbehinderten das Lernziel soziale Integration sehr gut verwirklicht werden kann.

AB - Die Bedeutung psychologischer Prozesse im sportlichen Handeln von Triathleten wird erörtert. Einleitend wird ein Modell von Emotionen als Folgen und Voraussetzungen von kognitiven Bewertungsprozessen vorgestellt. Dann wird gezeigt, dass sportliches Handeln nicht nur von inneren psychischen Prozessen abhängt, sondern auch von den Zielen, die der einzelne Sportler sich setzt. Anschließend werden die Motivationen besprochen, die Triathleten dazu bringen, diesen Sport zu betreiben, und Motivationsprobleme, die im Verlauf des sportlichen Handelns hinderlich sind, werden dargestellt. Dabei wird das Konzept der Probemotivierung eingeführt, und ein Training zur realistischen Einschätzung der eigenen Möglichkeiten wird skizziert. Im Anschluss daran werden Trainingsmaßnahmen vorgestellt, die Handeln und Handlungsanpassungen an Anforderungssituationen optimieren, ohne dass man sich dabei bewegt ("nichtmotorische Trainingsformen"). Zwei dieser Trainingsformen werden als besonders wichtig für Triathleten eingeschätzt, nämlich (1) das observative Training, bei dem man von einem Modell den besten Umgang mit Anforderungen durch Beobachtung lernt und (2) das mentale Training, in der die Anschauungsgrundlage nach innen verlagert wird. Außerdem werden Hinweise zur Bedeutung der Handlungsanalyse, des Vorstartzustands und der Konzentration im sportlichen Handeln von Triathleten gegeben.

AB - Merkmale der zentral-nervalen Aktivierung beim ideomotorischen Training (iT) wurden bei insgesamt elf Sportstudenten untersucht. Dabei zeigten sich charakteristische Veränderungen der mittleren Frequenz im Alpha-Bereich des Elektroenzephalogramms, der Herzschlagfrequenz, der Atemzugdauer und des Hautleitwerts. Der Verlauf dieser Parameter erwies sich als abhängig von der Anzahl, der Dauer und der zeitlichen Folge des ideomotorischen Trainings. Eine dosierte submaximale Ergometerbelastung beeinflusste den Verlauf der genannten Parameter nicht wesentlich. Die Untersuchungen führen zu der Schlussfolgerung, dass während der Ausführung des ideomotorischen Trainings in einzelnen Teilsystemen differenzierte Aktivierungsprozesse ablaufen. Es wird als notwendig angesehen, ein konkret verwendetes Paradigma zum Einsatz des ideomotorischen Trainings aus psychophysiologischer Sicht auf einen günstigen Verlauf der Aktivierungsparameter zu prüfen, um den Erfolg des Einsatzes des ideomotorischen Trainings im gewünschten Umfang zu gewährleisten.

Zunächst wird das Konzept des sozialen Netzwerks skizziert, das als Bindeglied zwischen klinischer Psychologie und Sportpsychologie fungiert. Dann werden anhand ausgewählter Forschungsergebnisse sowie anhand von zwei Fallberichten die Zusammenhänge zwischen sportlicher Aktivität und der sozialen Integration von psychisch Kranken veranschaulicht.

AB - Die gegenwärtige gesellschaftliche Situation von Bewegung, Spiel und Sport Behinderter wird maßgeblich durch zwei überkommene, anthropologisch begründete Leitbilder geprägt, die in der Literatur als unterschiedliche Antithesen erscheinen. Sie werden im behindertenpädagogischen Zusammenhang unter den Begriffen eines "normalitätsorientierten" und eines "behinderungsorientierten" Verständnisses zu fassen versucht. Es wird dargelegt, dass diese Leitbilder als positive Grundideen nicht hinterfragbar, dass sie jedoch in ihrer gesellschaftlichen Aktualität in sich sowie wechselseitig widersprüchlich sind und so das bestehende Ausmaß sozialer Desintegration widerspiegeln. Das entsprechende Sportverständnis isoliert Behinderte auch untereinander und betrifft dabei die Geistigbehinderten und unter ihnen die Schwerstbehinderten nach Art und Ausmaß am stärksten.

Daten wurden an einer Stichprobe von 40 studentischen Versuchspersonen erhoben, von denen 20 beim Erlernen einer Turnübung (große Körperwelle vorwärts) zunächst einen mentalen Übungsschritt durchliefen, während die übrigen 20 zunächst die physische Übungsbedingung absolvierten. Es zeigte sich, dass in den Anfangsphasen des sportmotorischen Modelllernens kognitiv-konzeptbildende Teilprozesse anteilsmäßig mehr zur Leistungsverbesserung beitrugen als motorisch-adaptive Teilprozesse. Die Wirkung der kognitiv-konzeptbildenden Prozesse basierte in erster Linie auf dem Aufbau und der zunehmenden Ausdifferenzierung einer ausführungsleitenden Bewegungsvorstellung, wohingegen die Funktion als Referenzwert zur Fehlermittlung am Anfang des Lernprozesses noch nicht zum Tragen kam.

Bezüglich der Funktionen von Rückmeldungen im Techniktraining werden eine Informationsfunktion und eine Verstärkungsfunktion unterschieden. Äußere Rückmeldungen werden für den Sportler dann als besonders effektiv erachtet, wenn er diese auf der Ebene der einer Bewegung zugrundeliegenden psychischen Prozesse (Tiefenstruktur) verwerten kann. Dazu werden drei globale Ansatzstellen unterschieden: (1) die Bewegungsvorstellung im Sinne der Sollwert-Einstellung, (2) die Bewegungswahrnehmung im Sinne der Istwert-Feststellung, (3) die erforderlichen Korrekturen der Bewegungsregulation im Sinne der Stellgrößenveränderung. Abschließend werden Hinweise dazu gegeben, wie viel Information Rückmeldungen enthalten sollen, wann und wie häufig Rückmeldungen erfolgen sollen und wie der Rückmeldungsprozess geplant und bewertet werden soll.

Aus 14 Variablen wurden fünf Faktoren extrahiert. Als wichtigster Faktor stellte sich ein Indikatorenkomplex "Lust am Sportbetrieb, Verbandsarbeit und Organisation des Sportbetriebs" heraus. Der zweitwichtigste Faktor beinhaltete ökologische Bedingungen wie Entfernungen und Fahrtwege. Es wird gefolgert, dass für die Stabilität der Trainertätigkeit nicht Persönlichkeitseigenschaften relevant sind, sondern die Bedingungen, unter denen die Tätigkeit stattfindet.

AB - Es werden Ergebnisse zum Zusammenhang von Sport und Indikatoren des Copingprozesses dargestellt, die zum ersten Messzeitpunkt einer zweijährigen Längsschnittstudie gewonnen wurden. Die Daten der 367 untersuchten Jugendlichen zeigten, dass sportlich aktive Jugendliche gegenüber inaktiven weniger rauchten, dass sportlich Aktive adaptivere gesundheitspsychologische Persönlichkeitswerte aufwiesen, zufriedener waren mit ihrer physischen, psychischen und sozialen Gesundheit und sich weniger belastet fühlten. Diese Unterschiede können sowohl als spezifische Effekte von sportlichen Aktivitäten als auch von sozialen Unterstützungsvariablen aufgefasst werden. Für hochbelastete, resiliente Jugendliche war es jedoch gerade ein höheres Ausmaß an sportlicher Aktivität, das sie von nonresilienten Jugendlichen unterschied. Zudem erlebten sich Jugendliche mit relativ hohen biographischen Risiken dann als weniger aktuell belastet, wenn sie regelmäßig Sport trieben. Sport wird somit vor allem für biographisch höher belastete Jugendliche als empfehlenswert betrachtet.

Ein Spieler kann beim Betrachten einer Bilderserie eine Episode eines Spiels ohne Zeit- und Erfolgsdruck studieren. Dabei geht es um Vorstellungen über reine Bewegungssteuerung ohne die Notwendigkeit zur verbalen Übersetzung. Diese Überlegungen werden auf dem Hintergrund des Schemabegriffs von Piaget, der Theorie mentaler Schemata und der gemeinsamen Entwicklung von Körperschema und Selbst im sensomotorischen Dialog reflektiert. Empirische Belege für die Annahme, dass sich die Vorstellungen von der tatsächlich gezeigten Episode lösen und sich einem kombinatorischen Experimentieren mit alternativen Schemata aus dem taktischen Repertoire zuwenden, werden angeführt.

Zur Objektivierung des MVT wurden bei Mitgliedern der Kunstturnnationalmannschaft und bei Leichtathleten aus der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik die Vorstellungszeiten für einzelne Wettkampfübungen und die Herzschlagfrequenz während bestimmter Phasen des MVT über einen Pulsindikator computerunterstützt erfasst. Die Befunde weisen auf einen Zusammenhang zwischen der Stabilität der Vorstellungszeit und der Qualität der Bewegungsvorstellung hin. Ausgewählte Ergebnisse zu den mittleren Herzschlagfrequenzen von Turnern während des MVT werden dargestellt.

AB - In einem Erkundungsexperiment wurden die Effekte unterschiedlicher Vorbelastungen auf die Bewegungsregulation von Sportlern untersucht, wobei die Prozesse der Informationsaufnahme und -verarbeitung sowie der Ausführungsregulation im Vordergund standen. Bei fünf Sportlern wurden als Vorbelastungen (1) eine sportartspezifische Athletiktrainingseinheit, (2) eine schnelligkeitsorientierte Erwärmung, (3) ein Koordinationsprogramm, (4) eine unspezifische psychische Erwärmung und (5) eine mentale Vorbereitung realisiert. Die Wirkungen dieser Vorbelastungen auf die Reaktionsfähigkeit, Bewegungsschnelligkeit und Bewegungsgenauigkeit wurden mit einer für den Leistungssport modifizierten Tracking-Variante (Folge-Verhaltens-Tests) erfasst. Die Ergebnisse belegen, dass die gesetzten Vorbelastungen unterschiedliche Veränderungen in den drei abhängigen Variablen auslösten. Die Reaktionsfähigkeit wurde durch die Vorbelastungen unterschiedlich stark gefördert, die Bewegungsschnelligkeit erwies sich als kurzzeitig nur in engen Grenzen beeinflussbar und die Bewegungsgenauigkeit konnte nur durch die unspezifische Erwärmung und die mentale Vorbereitung verbessert werden. Die Implikationen der Befunde für die Trainingsplanung und -gestaltung werden diskutiert.

Results showed that highly stressed coaches (i.e., those who experienced high levels of stress due to practice or competition over the last year) were less active and less authoritarian than their less stressed counterparts. The findings suggest that highly stressed coaches do not cope effectively with the complex array of tasks in rest period situations, thereby disturbing the recovery process of their athletes.

AB - Ausgehend von einem Überblick über die gesundheitsfördernde Wirkung regelmäßiger körperlicher Betätigung für den psychischen Bereich werden Anregungen für entsprechende Aktivitätsprogramme für ältere Menschen gegeben. Empirische Nachweise über die positive Auswirkung körperlicher bzw. sportlicher Aktivität liegen vor allem für folgende Teilbereiche vor: Wohlbefinden und Stimmung, Persönlichkeit und Selbstkonzept, kognitive Funktionen sowie physiologische Prozesse. Obwohl diese Zusammenhänge noch zu wenig für ältere Menschen erforscht wurden, gibt es Hinweise, dass körperliche (sportliche) Aktivität durch eine gleichzeitige physische, psychische und soziale Wirkung einen wesentlichen Beitrag zu einem erfolgreichen Alternsprozess leistet. Es wird vorgeschlagen, dass die Erhaltung des individuellen Wohlbefindens und die Befähigung zur eigenständigen Lebensführung in der Ausarbeitung und Etablierung von Aktivierungs- und Bewegungsprogrammen für Ältere im Vordergrund stehen sollten, und eine einseitige Ausrichtung auf körperliche Fitness vermieden werden sollte. Mit der Berücksichtigung psychosozialer Faktoren werden die Chancen für eine breitere Wirkweise und für langfristige Effekte erhöht.

AB - Vorgestellt wird ein auf Techniken der systemischen Familientherapie und erkenntnistheoretischen Grundsätzen des radikalen Konstruktivismus basierendes Modell für die psychologische Beratung im Sport. In diesem seit 1984 entwickelten Modell ist die Beratung langfristig begleitend und als externe, von der Mannschaft distanzierte Beratung des Trainers konzipiert. Wichtigstes Prinzip ist die Kooperation mit dem Trainer. Die von ihm dargestellten problematischen Sachverhalte aus dem System Trainer-Mannschaft werden gemeinsam mit den Beratern in funktionaler Weise umbewertet (Reframing), woraus sich gegebenenfalls explizite Interventionen, die dann vom Trainer durchgeführt werden, ableiten lassen.

Daten wurden mit Hilfe der Kartenlegetechnik an einer Stichprobe von vier Ruderern und ihrem Trainer zu sieben Zeitpunkten erhoben. In der Analyse der rekonstruierten subjektiven Theorien der Rennruderer und des Rudertrainers ließ sich kein Beleg für die Vermutung finden, dass eine Verbesserung der Bewegungsausführung analog zu einer Annäherung des Sortierverhaltens der Ruderer an das ihres Trainers kommt. Die Analyse der Makro- und Modalstrukturen der Ruderer, die an einem Regattawochenende befragt wurden, wiesen weder untereinander noch im Vergleich zu den Trainingsstrukturen wesentliche Übereinstimmungen auf.

Die Trainerinnen nannten zu den vier Kategorien der Feedback-Forschung (Frequenz, Präzision, Zeitstruktur, Modalität) weitere beeinflussende Faktoren, die darauf hindeuteten, dass sie nicht nur von einem einzigen Typus des Lernenden ausgingen. Die Widersprüche zwischen den subjektiven Feedback-Theorien und den Laborergebnissen der Feedback-Forschung werden als Beleg dafür gewertet, dass diese Forschung aus der Sicht der Trainerinnen relativ realitätsfern ist und dass sie nicht ihren praktischen Bedürfnissen entsprechend geprägt ist.

Im Vergleich der Gruppen wurden positive Effekte des mentalen Trainings belegt. Durch mentale Wiederholung (rehearsal) konnte die Information länger im (Kurzzeit-)Gedächtnis präsent gehalten werden, wodurch ein effektiver Vergleich zwischen Istwert und der verspätet eintreffenden Rückmeldung noch möglich war. Dieser Prozess wurde durch eine verbesserte Bewegungsausführung und eine verbesserte Fähigkeit zur Einschätzung von Bewegungsfehlern manifestiert.

Es handelt sich dabei um eine Form des mentalen Trainings, bei dem die Vorstellung so lebhaft sein muss, dass sie zum Aussenden von Impulsen in die ausführenden Teile des motorischen Systems führt. Bisherige Versuche mit dieser Trainingsform zeigten, (1) dass die vegetativen Funktionen, etwa Atmung und Kreislauf, in die vorgestellte Bewegungsausführung einbezogen wurden, (2) dass die ständig wiederholte Vorstellung der Ausführung des gleichen Handlungsprogramms bei zunehmender Wiederholungszahl seine Wirkung verlor und (3) dass bei mehrfacher Wiederholung die vegetativen Parameter sofort auf ihre Ausgangswerte zurückgingen, während sich Veränderungen im Elektroenzephalogramm nur geringfügig verminderten. Insgesamt sprechen die vorliegenden Befunde dafür, dass internalisierte Repräsentationssysteme den Gesetzen der Selbstorganisation und der Synergetik unterliegen.

Auf kognitionspsychologischer und handlungstheoretischer Grundlage wurden mit Hilfe eines strukturierten Dialogs handlungsleitende Kognitionen von zwölf Lehrern und drei Trainern erhoben und die Datensammlung über eine Videosimulation erweitert. Diese Daten wurden mit einer Strukturlegetechnik und inhaltsanalytisch ausgewertet. Die Analyse war die Grundlage für das Festlegen von Trainings- und Veränderungsschwerpunkten. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass Trainer wie Sportlehrer weitgehend nicht als "Problemlöser", sondern als routiniert Handelnde anzusehen sind. Bestimmte Reizkonstellationen, die mit Begriffen wie "Störung" oder "Provokation" belegt wurden, wurden mit den zugehörigen Reaktionen verknüpft. Die Schnelligkeit des Handelns vermittelte den Eindruck professionellen und routinierten Handelns, dieses war aber oft der Situation nicht angemessen. Kognitive Defizite zeigten sich vor allem in einer Einseitigkeit der Ursachenerklärung von Situationen, der wenig pädagogisch orientierten Auswahl von Handlungszielen, dem weitgehenden Fehlen von Handlungsalternativen und von Handlungs-Folge-Erwartungen.

AB - Das ideomotorische Training (IT) zur Optimierung psychischer Prozesse der Bewegungsregulation im Sport wird erläutert. Für die Ausbildung von mental und motorisch nachvollziehbaren bildhaften Hinweisen zur Handlungsregulation an Knotenpunkten des Bewegungsablaufes (Ausführungsorientierungen) wird eine zielgerichtete ideomotorische Vor- und Nachbereitung der Bewegungsaufgabe für erforderlich erachtet. Dabei soll der Aufnahme, Verarbeitung und Verbesserung körpereigener Informationen besonderes Augenmerk gelten. Am Beispiel des Skispringens wird die Einheit von mentalem Üben und sensomotorischer Ausführung illustriert. Die Integration des IT in den gesamten sportlichen Trainingsprozess und entsprechende empirische Ergebnisse werden dargestellt. Abschließend werden Perspektiven der Bewegungsregulation mittels IT umrissen.

Die Einbrüche der Kabeldienste und des kommerziellen Fernsehens in die Programme der drei überregionalen Stationen (Networks) seien gestoppt, wenn nicht umgekehrt worden. Dieser Erfolg der Networks sei jedoch durch kostspielige Programme erkauft worden, für deren Finanzierung auch steigende Werbeaufkommen kaum ausreichten. Neuerdings registriere man sinkende Einschaltquoten für Sportveranstaltungen und Langzeitserien (beispielsweise "Dallas"), jedoch steigende Beliebtheit langfristig nicht berechenbarer "Gelegenheitssendungen" (Mini-Serien, Fernsehfilme). Dies führe durch den Wegfall methodischer Zuschauerbindung zu Veränderungen traditioneller Fernsehgewohnheiten und damit zu hoher Unsicherheit der Erfolgsprognosen.

AB - Es werden Ergebnisse zum Körpererleben männlicher Sportler mitgeteilt. Insgesamt 84 Ringer und Ruderer der unteren Gewichtsklassen wurden mit dem "Fragebogen zur Beurteilung des eigenen Körpers" untersucht. Diese Sportler müssen wegen der besonderen Regeln ihrer Sportart ein vergleichweise niedriges Maximalgewicht einhalten und sind daher gezwungen, sich einer konsequenten Gewichtskontrolle zu unterwerfen. Etwa 31 Prozent von ihnen zeigten ein erheblich pathologisch verändertes Körpererleben. Dieser Befund lässt den Schluss zu, dass unter besonderen äußeren Bedingungen auch in männlichen Stichproben Störungen des Körpererlebens gehäuft vorkommen und es sich daher nicht um ein spezifisch weibliches Phänomen handelt. Weiterhin fanden sich bei dieser Untergruppe pathologische Auffälligkeiten auf fünf von zwölf persönlichkeitspsychologischen Skalen sowie im "Eating-Disorder-Inventory". Die Frage nach dem kausalen Zusammenhang zwischen Sporttraining und pathologischem Körpererleben sowie anderen Symptomen einer psychischen Störung wird abschließend diskutiert.

AB - Aktuelle Modelle der Bewegungsregulation, die informationstheoretische, ökologische sowie gestaltpsychologische Ideen berücksichtigen, legen es nahe, die interne Bewegungsrepräsentation als Rahmenkonstrukt für die theoretische Fundierung des Mentalen Trainings zu betrachten. Der Zusammenhang zwischen Daten zur internen Bewegungsrepräsentation und Daten zur Bewegungsausführung ist hierbei von grundlegender Bedeutung. Trotz der Bedeutsamkeit dieses Zusammenhangs für die Erklärung zahlreicher Phänomene des motorischen Lernens gibt es bisher kaum Verfahren, die es erlauben, die Daten zur internen Bewegungsrepräsentation und die Daten zur Bewegungsausübung zueinander in Beziehung zu setzen. Vor dem Hintergrund einer von Doignon und Falmagne vorgestellten Theorie der Wissensstrukturen sollten daher Analyse- und Auswerteverfahren entwickelt werden, die es erlauben, strukturelle Gemeinsamkeiten bzw. Unterschiede zwischen diesen beiden Datensätzen zu untersuchen. Hierzu wurden ausgehend von einer kognitiv-motorischen Analyse des ausgewählten Bewegungsablaufs - des Brustschwimmens - ein sensumotorischer Könnensbereich (Abbildung der individuellen Bewegungsausführung) sowie ein sensumotorischer Wissensbereich (Abbildung des individuellen Wissens über die bewegungsstrukturellen Merkmale des Brustschwimmens mit Hilfe kognitiver Aufgaben zur zeitlichen Kopplung dieser Schwimmart) konstruiert. Die Erhebung und Auswertung der Daten zu diesen Bereichen erfolgte so, dass aus dem Lösungsverhalten der Versuchspersonen Rückschlüsse auf ihre individuellen Könnens- bzw. Wissensstrukturen gezogen werden konnten. Zur empirischen Überprüfung dieses wissensdiagnostischen Vorgehens wurden drei Untersuchungen durchgeführt: In den ersten beiden Untersuchungen konnte nachgewiesen werden, dass Unterschiede zwischen Versuchspersonen, die sich in unterschiedlichem Maße praktisch (35 Sportstudenten und 12 Leistungsschwimmer) bzw. praktisch und theoretisch (drei unterschiedlich spezialisierte Gruppen französischer Sportstudenten; 6 bzw. 12 bzw. 24 Personen) mit dem Schwimmen auseinandersetzten, auch in den Lösungen der kognitiven Aufgaben zu verzeichnen waren. In einer quasi-experimentellen Untersuchung, bei der mit einer Versuchsgruppe (17 Personen) ein mentales Trainingsprogramm durchgeführt wurde, während bei der Kontrollgruppe (14 Personen) keine gezielte Intervention stattfand, manifestieren sich wesentliche Aspekte, die im Laufe des Lernprozesses bei den Versuchspersonen der Experimentalgruppe auf Bewegungsebene registriert werden konnten, auch auf der Aufgabenebene. Das wissensdiagnostische Vorgehen erwies sich demzufolge als geeignet, interne und externe Veränderungen im Verlauf eines motorischen Lernprozesses so abzubilden, dass sie zueinander in Beziehung gesetzt werden können.

Ferner werden Effekte psychologischer Trainingsmaßnahmen auf Reaktions- und Konzentrationsleistungen erörtert, und Erfahrungen mit autogenem Training und progressiver Muskelentspannung werden berichtet. Abschließend wird die Bedeutung einer kontinuierlichen und wechselseitig sich akzeptierenden Zusammenarbeit mit Trainern und Sportlern für die Effektivität sportpsychologischer Betreuung hervorgehoben.

AB - Physiologische Aktivierungsindikatoren im sportmotorischen Training werden untersucht. Als Vollzugsformen wurden das mental-ideometrische Training bei Schwimmern, das ideomotorisch-simulative Training bei Rennschlittensportlern und das real-motorisch-effektorische Komplextraining bei Ringern gewählt. Neben mehreren sportartspezifischen Parametern wurde unmittelbar vor sowie während der Beanspruchung ein Elektroenzephalogramm (EEG) abgeleitet, und Herzschlagfrequenz sowie Hautleitwert wurden gemessen. Als Folge der mental-ideomotorischen Realisierungsform der Schwimmer kam es während der Vorstellungsphasen zu deutlichen Änderungen im EEG. Herzschlagfrequenz und Hautleitwert stiegen während der ideomotorisch-simulativen Vollzüge bei den Rennschlittensportlern an. Auch bei den Ringern veränderte sich das EEG während des komplexen Techniktrainings. Diese Befunde werden als Beleg dafür gewertet, dass Leistungsparameter im Sport über neurophysiologische Aktivierungsparameter objektiviert werden können.

AB - In einer Untersuchung zur Bedeutung psychoregulativer Methoden im Hochleistungssport wurden 1981 21 Schützen und 1989 27 Schützen der Nationalmannschaft der damaligen Deutschen Demokratischen Republik befragt. Die Ausgangslage für die Befragung war gekennzeichnet durch die bereits nach den Olympischen Spielen von 1980 intensivierte Trainer- und Sportlerweiterbildung zu dieser Thematik: Vermittlung der "Psychoregulativen Einheit" mit den Komponenten Atemübungen, Selbstinstruktionen, mentale Übungen. Im Vergleich der beiden Erfassungszeitpunkte wurde ein höherer Beherrschungsgrad und eine höhere Einsatzhäufigkeit dieser Techniken für 1989 ermittelt, wobei es sich allerdings um verschiedene Sportlergruppen handelte. Je erfolgreicher die Schützen waren, desto besser beherrschten sie die psychoregulativen Methoden und desto häufiger wendeten sie diese an. Zum zweiten Erfassungszeitpunkt wurde eine insgesamt positivere Einstellung zur Psychoregulation registriert. Konsequenzen für die Trainingspraxis werden abgeleitet.

AB - Möglichkeiten des Einsatzes der Bewegungserziehung zur Förderung der sozialen Interaktionen von geistig Behinderten werden untersucht. Zunächst wird ein Überblick über die in diesem Zusammenhang relevanten psychologischen Theorien und empirischen Befunde gegeben. Daran anschließend wird eine empirische Untersuchung beschrieben, in der ein Konzept der Bewegungserziehung für geistig Behinderte entwickelt und erprobt wurde. 40 Erwachsene, die in einer Einrichtung für geistig Behinderte untergebracht waren, wurden zufallsverteilt in je vier Versuchs- und Kontrollgruppen unterteilt. Die Versuchsgruppen erhielten ein sechs Monate dauerndes Bewegungstraining ("Übungsphase"), bei dem einmal wöchentlich ein zweistündiges Bewegungserziehungsprogramm durchgeführt wurde. Alle Versuchspersonen wurden vor Trainingsbeginn und nach Trainingsende hinsichtlich ihres sozialen Interaktionsverhaltens in Realsituationen eingeschätzt (Beobachtung durch Betreuer). Dazu wurde eine Checkliste entwickelt, in der folgende Verhaltenskategorien erfasst wurden: aggressive Handlungen, Dominanz und Macht, prosoziale Handlungen, kooperative Handlungen, Abhängigkeit, individualistische Handlungen, Absonderung, Berührungsängste. Es zeigte sich, dass sich bei Personen der Versuchsgruppen die Interaktionshäufigkeit nach dem Training verdoppelte, während sie bei den Mitgliedern der Kontrollgruppen konstant blieb. Diese Zunahme in der Interaktionshäufigkeit ging einher mit einer qualitativen Verbesserung der Interaktionen (Zunahme der positiven und Abnahme der negativen Ansteuerungen). Insgesamt werden die Ergebnisse als Beleg dafür angesehen, dass die Bewegungstherapie zu einer deutlichen Verbesserung der sozialen Interaktionen bei geistig Behinderten führt.

AB - Regelmäßiger sportlicher Betätigung wird zugeschrieben, sie fördere sowohl die körperliche als auch die psychische Gesundheit. Während die protektive Wirkung vor allem eines Ausdauertrainings für die körperliche Gesundheit hinreichend verlässlich dokumentiert ist, sind die Befunde für die Wirkung auf die psychische Gesundheit weniger eindeutig. Trotz einer Vielzahl methodischer Mängel und einander widersprechender Befunde gelangen Konsensuskonferenzen aber zu der optimistischen Feststellung, regelmäßige sportliche Betätigung steigere das Wohlbefinden und die Selbstwertschätzung, mindere Angst und depressive Gefühle, unabhängig von der Art der sportlichen Betätigung, vom Alter und vom Geschlecht der Sporttreibenden. Mit einem als "Schmidt-Hunter-Methode" geläufigen meta-analytischen Verfahren wird im vorliegenden Bericht nach der Stärke und der Konsistenz der Befunde zum Zusammenhang von sportlicher Betätigung und psychischer Gesundheit gefragt. 39 Originalarbeiten mit 44 unabhängigen Effektgrößen und 8909 Probanden bildeten die Datengrundlage. Die Populationseffektgröße r#1tng = +.15 erwies sich als niedrig, nicht von Null verschieden und der Datensatz war ausgesprochen heterogen. Subgruppenanalysen offenbarten eine Reihe von Moderatoren, von denen sich das Alter und das Geschlecht der Sporttreibenden in Wechselwirkung mit der Art der sportlichen Betätigung am stärksten auswirkten. Die psychische Gesundheit von Frauen, die sich gymnastisch und tänzerisch betätigen, und von 31- bis 50-jährigen Personen, die ihre Ausdauer trainieren, profitiert konsistent von sportlicher Betätigung. Als Erklärung scheinen kontrollbezogene Erwartungs- und Passungseffekte plausible Mechanismen.

Für die 135 Frauen und 179 Männer wurden getrennte multiple, hierarchische Regressionsanalysen gerechnet, in denen die seelische Gesundheit zum zweiten Messzeitpunkt als Kriterium diente. Insgesamt weisen die Ergebnisse auf geschlechtsspezifische Wirkungen von Sport und sozialem Rückhalt hin: (1) Bei den Männern zeigten die beiden Ressourcen selbständige Gesundheitseffekte im Sinne kompensativer Wirkungen gegenüber den negativen Auswirkungen des Stressors Erwerbslosigkeit; diese Effekte konnten bei Frauen nicht beobachtet werden. (2) Bei niedrigem sozialem Rückhalt erwies sich der Sport bei den Männern als Stresspuffer, bei Frauen wirkte er in dieser Situation nur dann auf die seelische Gesundheit, wenn kein äußerer Stress vorlag. (3) Generell war der Sport bei beiden Geschlechtern dann am wirkungsvollsten zur Stabilisierung der seelischen Gesundheit, wenn der soziale Rückhalt gering war.

In der Voruntersuchung wurden zehn Spitzentrainerinnen und zehn Übungsleiterinnen über ihr deklaratives Strukturwissen und prozedurales Wissen interviewt. An der Hauptuntersuchung waren ebenfalls zehn Spitzentrainerinnen und zehn Übungsleiterinnen beteiligt. Die Datenerhebungen bezogen sich auf (1) die Videoaufzeichnung einer Trainingseinheit, (2) Interviews zur Explikation von Wissensinhalten zum Thema "Feedback" anhand eines Leitfadens und anhand der "Struktur-Lege-Technik", (3) Beispiele für auffällige Trainingssituation und (4) biographische Variablen. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass sowohl die erfahrenen als auch die weniger erfahrenen Trainerinnen dazu fähig waren, die zentralen Aspekte der Rückmeldung im Training zu identifizieren. Die Spitzentrainerinnen zeichneten sich jedoch in den meisten Bereichen durch eine stärkere begriffliche Differenzierung und durch eine für das Bewegungslernen relevantere Begrifflichkeit aus. Das deklarative Wissen der Experten war durch größere, bedeutsamere und fachrelevantere Einheiten gekeknnzeichnet als das der Übungsleiterinnen; sie verfügten überdies über eine erhöhte Speicherfähigkeit für trainingsrelevante Begriffe.

Betont wird, dass Mediziner und Hochleistungsfanatiker ungleich einflussreicher gewesen seien und dass Psychologen ihre Beiträge zu individuellem Training und psychischer Regulation der Sportler ohne Unterstützung der politischen Sportführung und eher indirekt durch Ausbildung der Trainer einbringen mussten. Konkrete Arbeitsansätze wie das ideomotorische Training und die ganzheitliche Orientierung am Sportler als Subjekt werden beschrieben.

Das System des Leistungssports wird durch das Begriffspaar Sieg/Niederlage charakterisiert, und die Pädagogik wird auf ihre Funktionalität im Rahmen einer solchen Systemcharakterisierung hin analysiert. Die wesentlichen Parameter des Erziehungsbegriffs werden auf den Leistungssport übertragen: Absichtlichkeit, Normativität, Bewusstheit, Personalität. Aufgrund der Analyse wird festgestellt, dass Erziehung im Leistungssport lediglich in ihrem nicht-intentionalen Aspekt erscheint. Im Hinblick auf die Hervorhebung der Systemfunktionalität der Pädagogik im Leistungssport wird Erziehung in ihrer Bedeutung für die Selbstbeschränkung begründet. Es wird geschlussfolgert, dass Trainer heute Pädagogik brauchen, damit Erfolg auch morgen möglich ist.

Bei Planung der Studie und Analyse der Untersuchungsergebnisse wurde besonderer Wert auf die Anwendung von Methoden der statistischen Versuchsplanung und statistischen Datenanalyse gelegt. Folgende Ergebnisse wurden gefunden: (1) Das mentale Training ist unter schulischen Bedingungen praktisch durchführbar und erbringt eine signifikante Leistungssteigerung; (2) ein Leistungsunterschied zwischen nur mentalem Training und einmaliger praktischer Parcoursbewältigung pro Trainingseinheit konnte nicht gesichert werden; (3) erst ein zweimaliges praktisches Training pro Einheit erbringt zwischen diesem und mentalem Training eine signifikante Leistungssteigerung.

AB - Es wird die These untersucht, dass das mentale Üben motorischer Fertigkeiten bezüglich der zentralnervalen Prozesse der Planung und motorischen Kontrolle als Modell der realen Bewegungsausführung dienen kann. Zentralnervale Aktivierungsprozesse wurden mittels Elektroenzephalographie (EEG) sowohl beim mentalen Üben als auch direkt vor und nach der praktischen Übung bei zwölf Ringkämpfern erfasst. Das EEG wurde unipolar über dem visuellen und dem primärmotorischen Cortex erfasst. Nach einer schnellen Fourier-Transformation wurde die mittlere Frequenz für das Alpha-Band des EEG (MAF) errechnet. Ein signifikanter Anstieg der MAF, in der Literatur als zentralnervale Aktivierung diskutiert, konnte für beide Beanspruchungssituationen für alle untersuchten Ableitungen gezeigt werden. Insgesamt bestätigen die Ergebnisse die These, dass mit dem mentalen Üben motorischer Fertigkeiten ein akzeptables Modell zur Untersuchung von Aktivierungsprozessen im Zusammenhang mit realer Bewegungsausführung vorliegt.

Letzteres wird im Wesentlichen von Trainingsformen bestimmt, die an den verschiedenen möglichen Störstellen der Verhaltensregelung und -steuerung ansetzen. Es werden sieben verschiedene Trainingsbereiche unterschieden: (1) observatives Training, (2) verbales Training, (3) mentales Training, (4) motorische Realisation, (5) psychoregulatives Training, (6) Erlebnis-Training und (7) gruppendynamisches Training. Für die verschiedenen Phasen des Trainings wird diesen Methoden ein unterschiedliches Gewicht beigemessen. Letztlich zwinge die derzeitige sportliche Trainingspraxis zu einem integrierten Einsatz verschiedenster psychologischer Methoden, da die zeitliche und physische Belastung insbesondere im Hochleistungssport Grenzwerte erreicht habe und kaum noch zu steigern sei.

Die Versuchspersonen wurden zur Hälfte einer Experimentalgruppe, die an einem mentalen Trainingsprogramm teilnahm, und zur anderen Hälfte einer Kontrollgruppe zugeordnet. Es zeigte sich, dass die Teilnahme am Trainingsprogramm zu deutlichen Veränderungen der kognitiven Repräsentation der zeitlichen Koppelung führte. Diese Veränderung ging allerdings nicht mit einer besseren Bewegungsausführung einher. Abschließend werden mögliche Gründe dafür erörtert, warum sich die bewegungsstrukturellen Prozessresultate nicht ebenso verbesserten wie die kognitiven Repräsentationen.

Anhand von ausgewählten empirischen Befunden wird deutlich gemacht, dass die genannten Hilfsmittel Sportler in einen Bewusstseinszustand versetzen, in dem die technischen, taktischen und mentalen Instruktionen des Trainers besonders tief und intensiv im Sportler verfestigt werden. Abschließend wird ein Beispiel für eine Verbalization während einer "mind machine"-Sitzung vorgestellt.

Nach Anmerkungen zur Rolle von Konzentration und Leistungdiagnostik im Sport werden verschiedene Gründe für den Mangel an Effizienzberichten in der Literatur zum psychologischen Training skizziert. Anschließend werden fünf Bedingungen bestimmt, die für eine günstige Erfolgsprognose des psychologischen Trainings im Sport relevant sind: Athlet-Psychologen-Beziehung, Erfolgserwartung, neue Erfahrungen, direkte Rückmeldung, selbständige Realitätskontrolle. Die Realisierung dieser Bedingungen soll zu einer Stärkung der Selbstwirksamkeit des Athleten führen.

AB - Im Rahmen einer Metaanalyse wird die sportwissenschaftliche Literatur zum Zusammenhang von Sport und seelischer Gesundheit untersucht. Datengrundlage waren 39 empirische Arbeiten aus dem Zeitraum von 1980 bis 1990. Die in der Literatur häufig postulierte nomopragmatische Hypothese, nach der eine regelmäßige sportliche Betätigung generell den psychischen Gesundheitszustand verbessert, wurde durch die durchgeführte Metaanalyse nicht gestützt. Es ergaben sich Hinweise darauf, dass verschiedene Variablen (Geschlecht, Alter, Belastungszeitraum, Form der sportlichen Betätigung) den genannten Zusammenhang moderieren. Abschließend werden Folgerungen für die zukünftige Forschung in diesem Bereich gezogen.

AB - Eine eigens entwickelte Methode zur Vervollkommnung der Bewegungsvorstellungen von Turnern und ausgewählte Ergebnisse zu den Wirkungen dieser Methode werden dargestellt. Im Kern geht es dabei darum, dass Sportler ihre Bewegungsempfindungen, -vorstellungen und -erfahrungen über jeweils eine turnerische Bewegung in Gruppen von sechs bis acht Sportlern äußern. In einer Gruppe von acht Spitzenturnern wurden in einem Zeitraum von 16 Monaten zwölf Sitzungen zum Austausch von Bewegungserfahrungen bezüglich eines spezifischen Übungselements durchgeführt. Zusätzlich wurden die Turner zu verschiedenen Zeitpunkten aufgefordert, ihre Selbstbefehle bei der Regulation der turnerischen Bewegungen schriftlich zu fixieren. Es zeigte sich, dass die Turner aus Mitteilungen der anderen für ihre eigene Trainingsarbeit positive Erfahrungen übernehmen konnten. Die Anzahl der Selbstbefehle verringerte sich mit zunehmender Automatisierung.

AB - Auf dem Hintergrund eines systemischen Verständnisses menschlicher Interaktionen wird untersucht, ob und in welchem Maße Ausdauersportler und ihre Partner ihre Gesundheit und ihre Partnerschaft durch Ausdauersport beeinflusst sehen. Dazu wurden Selbst- und Fremdattributionen von 28 Triathleten bezüglich Veränderungen ihres körperlichen, seelischen und sozialen Befindens und ihrer Partnerschaft seit der Aufnahme von Ausdauertraining anhand eines selbstentwickelten Fragebogens erfasst. Zusätzlich wurden soziale Schicht, Wohngegend, sportliches Leistungsniveau und soziale Unterstützung erhoben. Die meisten Ausdauersportler beurteilten ihre Gesundheit verbessert, die meisten Partner beurteilten ihre Gesundheit unverändert. Verschiedene Bereiche der Partnerschaft wurden von den Sportlern und ihren Partnern als unverändert angesehen, Verbesserungen wurden häufiger angegeben als Verschlechterungen. Sowohl bezüglich der eigenen Gesundheit als auch der Partnerschaft wurden Verschlechterungen signifikant häufiger von den Partnern angegeben. Es wird gefolgert, dass Ausdauersport in Partnerbeziehungen unterschiedlichen Stellenwert einnimmt und unterschiedliche Möglichkeiten bestehen, Ausdauersport in die Partnerschaft zu integrieren.

Anforderungen von Aufgabensituationen, Anweisungsverhalten des Lehrers und Bewegungshandlungen von Schülern werden dargestellt und analysiert. Aufgrund des so erreichten vertieften Verständnisses der Bedingungen von Bewegungshandlungen werden Vorschläge für die Vermittlung von Bewegungskönnensmustern erarbeitet. Primärgrundlage für die Analysen sind schriftliche Protokolle von Schulstundenbeobachtungen, aus denen Geschehenstypen rekonstruiert werden. Verschiedene Teilaufgaben des Kegelspiels werden besprochen. Es schließt sich die beispielhafte Analyse weiterer Bewegungsaufgaben und -handlungen an (Ballspiel, Flanke, Reifenlaufen, Bilden eines Kreises, Seilhüpfen und andere). Im Anschluss an die primär individualhandlungszentrierten Analysen werden schließlich Prinzipien des Aufbaus von Schulstundensituationen im Gruppenunterricht analysiert und Vorschläge für dessen Gestaltung gemacht.

AB - Diagnostische Zielsetzung: Mit dem Heidelberger Verfahren zur Diagnose und Veränderung von Trainerverhalten wird die Veränderung handlungsleitender Kognitionen bei Trainern im Leistungssport mit dem Ziel möglichst konfliktfreier Interaktionen zwischen Trainer und Athlet angestrebt.<br> - Aufbau: Beim HDVT wird eine Diagnose- und eine Trainingsphase unterschieden: (I) In der Diagnosephase sind vorgesehen: (1) Rekonstruktion der handlungsleitenden Kognitionen und Emotionen mit Hilfe eines Strukturierten Dialogs, (2) Rekonstruktion früherer "kritischer Vorfälle", (3) Analyse der eigenen Wahrnehmungen und Handlungen anhand von Videosimulationen, (4) Auswertung der Selbstbefragungen zu kritischen Vorfällen und der Sammlung früherer kritischer Vorfälle, (5) grafische Auswertung, (6) Wahl zwischen 15 vorgegebenen Handlungsmöglichkeiten mit Begründung, (7) Entscheidung zwischen sechs dargestellten Trainertypen und Reflektion deren jeweiliger Vor- und Nachteile, (8) Vergleich der erfolgten Auswertungen mit den gefundenen Verknüpfungen (Situations- mit Handlungsklassen) sowie dem individuellen kognitiven Profil, das sich als Ergebnis der Auswertung der Strukturierten Dialoge herauskristallisiert hat. Am Ende des Diagnoseprozesses werden anhand von Leitfragen Trainingsschwerpunkte festgelegt. (II) In den Trainingsmaterialien werden zu zentralen Aspekten (1 Situationswahrnehmung, 2 Bedeutungsbeimessung, 3 Emotionale Beteiligung, 4 Ursachenerklärung, 5 Situations-Folge-Erwartungen, 6 Handlungsziele, 7 Handlungsmöglichkeiten, 8 Handlungs-Folge-Erwartungen, 9 Ergebnisauffassung) wissenschaftlich abgesicherte Informationen gegeben, die durch Aufgaben für den Trainer ergänzt werden.<br> - Grundlagen und Konstruktion: Das HDVT wurde im Rahmen von Forschungsprojekten auf der Basis von Erfahrungen entwickelt, denen zufolge es im Leistungssport in der Interaktion zwischen Trainer und Athlet immer wieder Schwierigkeiten gibt, die sich nachteilig auf die subjektive Befindlichkeit der Beteiligten auswirken können. Ziel der Arbeitsmaterialien ist die Veränderung von Verhalten, wobei dies ausgehend von kognitionspsychologischen Ansätzen das Bewusstmachen kognitiver Prozesse, sog. subjektiver Theorien, voraussetzt. Als Grundlage für die Zuordnung der Kognitionen in Lehr-Lern-Prozessen dient das von Hanke (1980) weiterentwickelte kognitive Modell der Lehrer-Schüler-Interaktion von Hofer und Dobrick (1978), das auf die Trainer-Athlet-Interaktion bezogen wird. Als Methode wurde der von Wahl und Mitarbeitern entwickelte "Strukturierte Dialog" gewählt, den sie für den Bereich des Leistungssports adaptierten und erweiterten. Der inhaltliche Schwerpunkt wird auf sogenannte "kritische Vorfälle" gelegt, die als typische Extremsituationen anzusehen sind, in denen Einstellungen und Verhalten offenkundig werden.<br> - Empirische Prüfung und Gütekriterien: Es wird lediglich von positiven Erfahrungen mit dem HDVT berichtet, Angaben zu empirischen Prüfungen hinsichtlich der Gütekriterien finden sich nicht.

AB - Befunde aus fünf empirischen Studien zu den ressourcenprotektiven Effekten körperlicher Aktivität werden dargestellt. Den theoretischen Hintergrund bildet die Ressourcenerhaltungstheorie, auf deren Basis deutschsprachige Fragebogenverfahren zur Ressourcenerhaltung (German Conversation of Resources - Evaluation; GCOR-E) für verschiedene Anwendungskontexte entwickelt wurden. Studie I wurde bei 28 Teilnehmern an ambulanten und stationären Sporttherapien, Studie II bei 10 Patienten mit Knie-Endoprothesen in stationärer Sporttherapie, Studie III bei 9 Patienten mit Bandscheibenvorfällen in ambulanter Sporttherapie, Studie IV bei 21 erwachsenen Sport-Wiedereinsteigern und Studie V bei 87 Teilnehmern an Seniorensport mit jeweils mehreren Erhebungszeitpunkten durchgeführt. Neben kontextspezifischen GCOR-E-Fragebogen und medizinischen Variablen wurden Daten mit der Beschwerdeliste, dem State-Trait-Anxiety-Inventary, einer Selbstwirksamkeitsskala, einer Skala zur erwarteten sozialen Unterstützung, den Frankfurter Selbstkonzept-Skalen sowie einem Fragebogen zum Selbst- und Körperkonzept erhoben. In den drei Studien aus dem klinischen Bereich ergab sich eine gute konvergente, divergente und prognostische Validität für die Prinzipien des Ressourcengewinns und -verlusts. Die Ergebnisse der Studien aus dem primär-präventiven Bereich blieben dagegen inkonsistent. Es wird gefolgert, dass die Wirksamkeit von Sport und Bewegung auf Variablen der psychischen Gesundheit bislang überschätzt wurde und dass die Theorie der Ressourcenerhaltung im Bereich kritischer Lebensereignisse und Krisen einen guten theoretischen Bezugsrahmen liefert.

Den Ausgangspunkt bildet die Feststellung, dass der Weg zu höchster Kompetenz und Leistung intensives Üben beinhaltet und über mehrere Plateauphasen verläuft. Eine zentrale Bedeutung für das Erzielen von Spitzenleistungen wird dem mentalen Training zugeschrieben. Zur Illustration wird das siebenstufige Trainingsprogramm des Sportpsychologen R. Suinn vorgestellt; es umfasst Entspannung, Stressmanagement, Gedankenkontrolle, Selbstregulierung, visuell-motorische Übung, Konzentration und Energiekontrolle. Es wird betont, dass sich die meisten in der Sportpsychologie bewährten Methoden auf andere Leistungsbereiche übertragen lassen. Als eine weitere Variable, die für das Erzielen von Höchstleistungen relevant ist, wird die Selbstwirksamkeit erläutert.

AB - Zur Überprüfung der in der Literatur teilweise widersprüchlichen Befunde wurde der Effekt imaginierter Muskelkontraktionen (IMC-Training) auf die isometrische Maximalkraft (MVC) untersucht. Im Rahmen eines vierwöchigen kontrollierten Trainingsprogramms trainierten 34 Versuchspersonen die Kraftübung Bankdrücken entweder physisch (Gruppe "MaxKraft", zwölf Personen), das heißt mit maximalen isometrischen Kontraktionen, oder indem sie die entsprechenden Kontraktionen so lebhaft als möglich imaginierten (Gruppe "Mental", elf Personen). Die Kontrollgruppe (elf Personen) hatte kein Training. Vor, während (nach 7 bzw. 14 Tagen) und am Ende der Trainingsphase wurde die Relativkraft (MVC relativiert am Körpergewicht) erfasst. Im Gegensatz zur Kontrollgruppe verzeichnet die mental übende Gruppe einen signifikanten Kraftgewinn. Der stärkste Vorstellungseffekt fand sich dabei zu Beginn der Trainingsphase. Die Kraftgewinne der physisch übenden Gruppe wurden allerdings nicht erreicht. Der Kraftanstieg infolge eines IMC-Trainings wird als Verbesserung der muskulären Aktivierung und somit als Anpassung der zentralen Programmierung interpretiert.

AB - In einer empirischen Studie mit 83 Sportlerinnen und Sportlern, die für die Schweiz an den Olympischen Sommerspielen 2000 in Sydney teilnahmen, wurden die mentalen Faktoren untersucht, die dem Ausschöpfen des Leistungspotenzials im Wettkampf entgegen stehen. Etwa zwei bis drei Tage nach dem jeweils letzten Olympiawettkampf wurden die Athletinnen und Athleten schriftlich danach befragt, inwieweit sie in ihrem Wettkampf mit Problemem der (Selbst-)Motivation, des Selbstvertrauens, der Konzentration, der Gedankenkontrolle, der Emotionskontrolle und der Aktivierungskontrolle konfrontiert waren. Darüber hinaus wurden Fragen nach äußeren Wettkampfbedingungen, Teamgeist und somatischen Problemen gestellt. Erfolg und Leistung wurden objektiv über die Platzierung und subjektiv über die Frage nach dem Grad der Ausschöpfung des Leistungspotenzials erhoben. Die Prävalenz von Problemen der Emotions- und Angstkontrolle (zwischen 41 und 25 Prozent) wird als Beleg für die Relevanz dieser mentalen Probleme im Wettkampf gewertet. Geschlecht, Alter und Erfahrung erwiesen sich nicht als relevante Faktoren für das Auftreten mentaler Probleme. Erwartungsgemäß spiegelte sich sowohl in der objektiven als auch in der subjektiven Leistung die Häufigkeit von mentalen Problemen wider. Besonders relevant waren dabei leistungshemmende Gedanken und Emotionen, mangelndes Selbstvertrauen, "Verkrampfung" in wichtigen Situationen, Verunsicherung durch Kleinigkeiten und fehlender Spaß am Wettkampf. Auf die methodische Problematik der retrospektiven Erfassung wird hingewiesen. Aus den Ergebnissen wird die Sinnhaftigkeit psychologischer Verfahren der Selbstbeeinflussung im Sport abgeleitet.

AB - Über das Mitte 1995 entstandene Forschungsprojekt "Basketball FundaMental Training" (BB-FMT), dessen Anliegen war, ein personenzentriertes sportartspezifisches psychologisches Trainingsprogramm zur situationsbezogenen Stressbewältigung im Spielverlauf zu entwickeln und im praktischen Einsatz auf seine Anwendbarkeit und Wirksamkeit hin zu überprüfen, wird berichtet. Die Ergebnisse des Forschungsprojekts zeigen, dass das BB-FMT einen sehr erfolgversprechenden Weg darstellt, die individuelle Spielleistung im Leistungssport Basketball bedeutend zu verbessern. Als basketballspezifische Diagnosemittel wurden der "Stressbewältigungsfragebogen-Basketball", bzw. das "Stress-Management-Inventory-Basketball", der Fragebogen "Interferierende Kognitionen-Basketball" bzw. "Questionnaire Interfering Cognitions Basketball" entwickelt. Die Übungsformen (Vorstellungsübungen, Selbstinstruktionen, Focussierungsübungen) zur situativen Stressbewältigung im Wettkampfverlauf bzw. zur Optimierung konkreter Spielleistungsbereiche (etwa Wurfquote, Ballgewinne, Rebounds) waren für die Spieler leicht nachvollziehbar und erwiesen sich als wirkungsvoller Ansatz zur individuellen Leistungsoptimierung. Mit Hilfe der Effektivitätsüberprüfung konnte für jeden Spieler nachgeprüft werden, ob die Übungen tatsächlich zu einer Leistungssteigerung in den angestrebten Spielbereichen geführt hatten. Der Vergleich der Leistungsdaten der Teilnehmer aus den Kontrollgruppen (sieben Spieler) mit den jeweiligen Untersuchungsphasen der Treatmentangehörigen (sechs Spieler) bestätigte zudem, dass die signifikanten Niveauunterschiede der Leistungsdaten, die für die Spieler während der Treatmentphasen im Vergleich zu den interventionsfreien Zeiträumen gefunden worden waren, nicht auf einen allgemeinen Leistungsanstieg der Gesamtmannschaft im Saisonverlauf zurückzuführen waren.

More than 90 percent of instructors and participants were women. Results showed large differences in the age and sport careers of participants. A factor analysis of the instructors' aims showed a dominance of sociability and community, body experience, and health and everyday life. A further factor analysis revealed that the most important competencies and characteristics of instructors were the ability to lead a group and mediate between members, followed by practical sports ability and didactic knowledge. Both aims and competencies differed as a function of the age structure and sport careers of the participants.

Die Personen wurden aufwändig medizinisch, sportwissenschaftlich und mit psychologischen Fragebögen untersucht. Der Gesundheitszustand wurde mit Hilfe von Selbsteinschätzungen und biologischen Parametern gemessen. Einzelne Gesundheitsindikatoren zum zweiten Zeitpunkt hingen direkt oder indirekt vom Lebensalter, Übergewicht (BMI), Glukosespiegel und weiteren biologischen Parametern eines "metabolischen Syndroms", Sporttreiben sowie - mit Einschränkungen - von der Lebenszufriedenheit und seelischen Gesundheit (Fähigkeit zur Bewältigung externer und interner psychischer Anforderungen) zum ersten Zeitpunkt ab. Aus den Ergebnissen werden Konsequenzen für die Prävention, Gesundheitsförderung und Rehabilitation abgeleitet.

Für Studie I wurden im Rahmen des Hochschulsports vier gesundheitsorientierte Sportgruppen für die Dauer eines Jahres eingerichtet, deren Teilnehmer im Abstand von 12 beziehungsweise 24 Übungseinheiten vier Mal befragt wurden. In Studie II wurden die Teilnehmer an gesundheitsorientierten Sportprogrammen aus acht Sportvereinen vor und nach zehn Übungseinheiten befragt. Bei den insgesamt 288 Erwachsenen beider Studien wurden unter Bezug auf Modelle zum Gesundheitsverhalten personale Faktoren (Konsequenz- und Selbstwirksamkeitserwartungen, Selbsteinschätzungen der Gesundheit, Zufriedenheit mit der Gesundheit, Stresswahrnehmung und Intention), soziale Faktoren (sportbezogene Unterstützung durch persönliche Bezugspersonen und die Sportgruppe, Gruppenkohäsion sowie Übungsleiterverhalten) und programmspezifische Faktoren (inhaltlich-organisatorische und räumlich-materielle Bedingungen) als Determinanten des Verbleibs in der Sportgruppe erhoben. Strukturanalytisch gewonnene Ergebnisse weisen darauf, dass neben den Selbstwirksamkeits- und Konsequenzerwartungen sowie der sportbezogenen sozialen Unterstützung den sozialen und den programmspezifischen Faktoren eine hohe Bedeutung für den Erhalt der sportlichen Aktivität zukommt.

AB - Selbstvorstellungen beeinflussen wesentlich das Selbstkonzept, die Motivation zu Bewegung, Spiel und Sport sowie die dauerhafte Bindung an ein Sport- und Bewegungsangebot bei Behinderten. Die selbst wahrgenommene Kompetenz wird als eines der bedeutendsten Konstrukte innerhalb des Selbstkonzepts sowie der Leistungsmotivation einer Person angesehen. Susan Harters "Competence Motivation Theory" nimmt einen wichtigen Platz innerhalb der Sportpsychologieforschung in Nordamerika und Kanada ein. Dort findet ihre Theorie bereits seit Jahren weit verbreitete Akzeptanz sowohl im Bereich der Sportwissenschaft als auch innerhalb der Sonderpädagogik. In Deutschland hingegen findet die Theorie von Harter bisher eher wenig oder kaum Anerkennung bzw. Anwendung. Nur sehr wenige Forschungsarbeiten haben sich bisher mit der selbst wahrgenommenen Kompetenz und sozialen Akzeptanz bei Personen mit geistiger Behinderung in Deutschland beschäftigt. Es gibt nur sehr wenig Befunde über das Selbstkonzept bei erwachsenen Personen mit geistiger Behinderung und dessen Bedeutung innerhalb von Motivationsprozessen. Selbstvorstellungen in spezifischen Bereichen sind bedeutend innerhalb der Motivation zu weiteren Meisterungsversuchen in Bildungs- und Erziehungsmaßnahmen, vor allem im Kontext sportlicher Aktivität. Forschungsarbeiten im Bereich der Sportpsychologie bzw. Sonderpädagogik in Deutschland sollten verstärkt in eine Anwendung von Harters Theorie für Personen mit geistiger Behinderung investieren.

AB - Es wird untersucht, in welchem Maße Attributionen und einige ausgewählte Emotionen bei Volleyballern nach einer Niederlage oder nach einem Sieg im Tie-Break eines entscheidenden Meisterschaftsspiels auftreten. Kernpunkt war hierbei die Überprüfung der von B. Weiner aufgestellten Hypothesen der Ergebnis- und Dimensionsabhängigkeit bestimmter Gefühle. Dazu wurden insgesamt 157 Volleyballer und Volleyballerinnen aus verschiedenen Alters- und Leistungssgruppen durch einen in Anlehnung an S. Rethorst entwickelten Fragebogen aufgefordert, ihre eigene Handlung in zwei vorgegebenen Wettkampfsituationen als subjektiven Misserfolg oder als persönlichen Erfolg zu beurteilen sowie Auskünfte über ihr nachfolgendes Trainingsengagement zu geben. Weiners Hypothese der Ergebnisabhängigkeit der Emotionen Enttäuschung und Freude konnte bestätigt werden. Dagegen trafen seine Aussagen zur Dimensionsabhängigkeit der Gefühle Resignation, Ärger, Dankbarkeit, Zuversicht und Stolz nicht zu. Lediglich für Schuldgefühle ließ sich auf der Lokationsdimension ein attributionsabhängiges Verhalten feststellen. Die subjektive Bewertung der Situation als einen hohen bzw. niedrigen Misserfolg oder Erfolg beeinflusste die Intensität der Emotionen. Aus den Befunden werden Hinweise zum Coaching zweier unterschiedlicher Spielertypen und ein konkreter Handlungsplan zur Unterstützung der psychischen Stabilität in volleyballtypischen Leistungssituationen abgeleitet.

AB - Auswirkungen sportlicher Aktivität auf die seelische Gesundheit werden untersucht. In einem Feldexperiment wurden 183 Personen im mittleren Erwachsenenalter nach Zufall auf eine von vier Bedingungen aufgeteilt: zwei Versuchsbedingungen mit sportlichen Inhalten (Jogging oder gemischtes Sportprogramm); zwei Kontrollbedingungen ohne sportliche Inhalte, aber mit einer gezielten Intervention, nämlich Entspannungstraining und Rückenschulung (Placebo-Aufmerksamkeitsgruppen). Alle Probanden nahmen ein halbes Jahr lang zweimal wöchentlich an den Versuchs- bzw. Kontrollgruppenprogrammen teil. Vor Beginn und nach Beendigung des Programms erfolgte die Erhebung der abhängigen Variablen (habituelles Wohlbefinden, Stressreaktivität). Das habituelle Wohlbefinden wurde außerdem sechs Monate nach Programmabschluss erfasst. Zum zweiten Messzeitpunkt fanden sich Veränderungen auf zwei Skalen des Wohlbefindens (Depressivität, psychosomatische Beschwerden) für alle Gruppen, unabhängig von der Intervention. In zwei Variablen (Trait-Ärger-Reaktion und Stressaktivität) zeigten die Jogging- und die Entspannungsgruppe positive Veränderungen. Die Ergebnisse des dritten Messzeitpunkts deuten an, dass die Effekte der Interventionen in einigen Variablen (Trait-Ärger und psychosomatische Beschwerden) langfristig stabil bleiben; sie werden unter dem Gesichtspunkt sportspezifischer bzw. langfristiger Wirkungen diskutiert.

AB - Die Lern- und Entwicklungsfähigkeit von Personen und Organisationen im Sport wird vor dem Hintergrund wachsender Komplexität zu einem zentralen Thema. Als prägender Sozialisationsrahmen erweist sich dabei die jeweilige Lernkultur, in deren Klima über Werte und Normen gezielte Einstellungen angestrebt werden. So bilden sich durch die systemische Verbindung emotionaler und kognitiver Prozesse in Personen mentale Modelle ihrer Kompetenzen und Leistungsfähigkeiten in enger Verbindung zu Selbstwert und Selbstvertrauen. Vor diesem Hintergrund werden den Lern- und Leistungsfeldern im Sport unzeitgemäße Relikte einer preußischen Menschenbildung unterstellt, die sich auf eine ausgeprägte Fremdsteuerung und Anpassungsbereitschaft stützt. Im Sport bildet sich deshalb in Bezug auf Leistung ein immer diffuseres Dickicht aus Versagensängsten, Vermeidungsstrategien und Psychospielen. Für Trainerinnen und Trainer im Spannungsfeld zwischen Sportlern, Verband und Öffentlichkeit stellt diese alte Kultur ein wachsendes Problemfeld dar. Selbst in diesen psychischen Landschaften aufgewachsen, fehlen ihnen in zunehmendem Maße alternative Perspektiven bis hin zu konkreten Hilfestellungen. Es zeichnet sich ein längst überfälliger Mentalitätenwechsel ab, dessen Menschenbilder sich an einem systemischen Verständnis emotional-kognitiver Intelligenz orientieren. Erste Konkretisierungen, die das Lernen von Kompetenzen als Zusammenspiel psychophysiologischer Regelkreise durch Biofeedback begreifbar machen sollen, beschließen den Beitrag.

AB - Es wird über Erfahrungen berichtet, die mit der Integration des Short Message Service (SMS) in das Coaching von Spitzensportlern gesammelt wurden. Im Rahmen der Betreuung und Vorbereitung der Volleyball-Juniorinnen-Nationalmannachaft auf die Weltmeisterschaft 2001 wurde erstmals ein neu erarbeitetes Konzept des Mental Coaching - das "Programm zur Entwicklung Mentaler Kontrolle im Volleyball" (ProMent) - während vorbereitender Trainingslager implementiert, und die Umsetzung von Techniken mentaler Kontrolle wurde bis zum Wettkampf durch ein SMS-Coaching individuell und bidirektional unterstützt. Neben einer Erläuterung der technischen Aspekte des SMS werden weitere Anwendungen im Sportcoaching beschrieben, beispielsweise bei der ersten Bundesligamannschaft der Frauen des TSV Bayer Leverkusen und in der Nationalmannschaft der Frauen in Deutschland. Die bisherigen Erfahrungen zeigen, dass der Einsatz von SMS zur Fortführung von Interventionsmaßnahmen bei Leistungssportlern geeignet ist und die Grenzen des klassischen Coaching erweitert. Die hohe Akzeptanz unter den Athleten macht dieses Verfahren zu einem kostengünstigen Tool, um Absenzphasen des Sportpsychologen zu überbrücken und bereits erlernte Inhalte von Coachingprogrammen - etwa Selbstinstruktionen - "anzutriggern".

AB - Sport- und Bewegungstherapie sind feste Bestandteile im Behandlungsangebot psychiatrischer und psychosomatischer Kliniken. Auch im ambulanten Bereich werden entsprechende Methoden häufig angeboten. Zu den evidenzbasierten Therapien kann die Mehrzahl der verschiedenen Verfahren jedoch nicht gezählt werden. Nur für Dauerleistungstraining liegen kontrollierte Studien vor und diese wiederum beziehen sich fast ausnahmslos auf die Behandlung depressiver Störungen. Die Behandlungsmethode des Ausdauertrainings ist theoretisch durch neurobiologische Wirkmechanismen fundiert. Das bei entsprechenden tierexperimentellen Untersuchungen gefundene Phänomen der Zunahme neurotropher Faktoren und die damit einhergehende hippokampale Neurogenese sowie das Phänomen des Anstiegs von Neurotransmitterkonzentrationen machen klinische antidepressive Effekte erklärbar. Von gesicherten Ergebnissen, die das Ausdauertraining zu einer zuverlässigen, syndromgerichteten Therapie machen würden, kann jedoch noch nicht gesprochen werden. Alle anderen Verfahren, die unter den Bezeichnungen Sport- und Bewegungstherapie oder körperorientierte Therapie in der Praxis erscheinen, sind derzeit noch nicht wissenschaftlich abgesichert.

AB - m Beispiel des Nachwuchsleistungssports wird der Einfluss der aus Athletensicht wahrgenommenen Trainer-Athlet-Interaktion auf die Leistungsentwicklung und Zufriedenheit junger Sportler in Mannschafts- und Individualsportarten dargestellt. In einer Studie über zwei Messzeitpunkte wurden neben der subjektiven Beurteilung des Führungsverhaltens (Leadership Scale for Sports) und des motivationalen Trainingsklimas (Perceived Motivational Climate in Sports Questionnaire) Daten zur Zufriedenheit und Leistungsentwicklung von 212 Sportlern (76 weiblich und 136 männlich) und deren Trainer (5 Frauen und 13 Männer) erfasst. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die Trainer-Athlet-Interaktion in Abhängigkeit von der Sportart betrachtet werden muss. In Individualsportarten ging die Leistungsentwicklung mit einem hohen Maß an subjektiv wahrgenommenen Instruktionen und einem ausgeprägten aufgabenorientierten Trainingsklima einher und stand in einem negativen Zusammenhang mit der berichteten sozialen Unterstützung. In Mannschaftsspielen hingegen standen Instruktionen in einem negativen und die soziale Unterstützung in einem positiven Zusammenhang zur Leistungsentwicklung.

AB - Nach dem Stichprobenansatz (Fiedler) entstehen viele Urteilsfehler nicht unbedingt durch kognitive Defizite, sondern durch den Prozess des Sammelns von Informationen. Die daraus resultierende Informationsstichprobe kann aus vielerlei Gründen unzulänglich oder verzerrt sein, wobei Menschen sich dieser Verzerrungen und Unzulänglichkeiten in der Regel nicht bewusst sind. Es wird über drei Experimente informiert, bei denen sowohl 40 ausgebildete Trainerinnen und Trainer als auch insgesamt 100 Studierende eine fehlende Sensibilität für Manipulationen der Informationsstichprobe zeigten. Die Aufgabe bestand darin, entweder einen Fußballspieler (Experimente 1 und 3) oder verschiedene Sportarten (Experiment 2) aufgrund von erinnerten Informationen zu bewerten. Dabei wurde die Menge an positiver und negativer Informationen in den subjektiven Gedächtnisstichproben durch "Category-Split" (Fiedler und Armbruster) und die Abrufleichtigkeit (Schwarz und Mitarbeiter) manipuliert. Die Urteile spiegelten die Information in den Gedächtnisstichproben wider, d. h., die offensichtlichen Verzerrungen wurden nicht korrigiert. Die Implikationen dieser Befunde für Bewertungen im Sport und die Sportberichterstattung werden diskutiert.

Der AVI ist eine Form von "Mind Machine" und besteht aus einem impulsgebenden, in der Regel computergesteuerten Gerät (Brille mit Leuchtdioden und Kopfhörern), durch das dem Nutzer vorgegebene Frequenzen in Form von Lichtblitzen und gepulsten Schallwellen zugeführt werden. Über diese Stimulation soll eine für das mentale Training notwendige ressourcevolle Entspannung hergestellt werden. Der praktische Einsatz und die positiven Ergebnisse des GMT werden an Beispielen aus den Sportarten Basketball, Fußball und Leichtathletik demonstriert. Im zweiten Teil werden Anwendungsmöglichkeiten von Techniken des Neurolinguistischen Programmierens (NLP) als Mentaltraining zur Leistungssteigerung im Sport demonstriert. - Inhalt: (1) M.

AU - Schek, Alexandra.

LA - German 
AB - Der Einfluss der Nahrung auf das seelische Wohlbefinden wird aus sportwissenschaftlicher Sicht im Überblick erörtert. Es ist unstrittig, dass regelmäßige sportliche Betätigung, gesunde und genussvolle Ernährung sowie ausreichend lange Ruhephasen sich positiv auf das körperliche, geistige und seelische Befinden auswirken. Physischer und psychischer Stress, wie er im Leistungssport bei entsprechend großen Trainingsumfängen und häufigen Wettkämpfen auftritt, kann bei prädisponierten Individuen an der Entstehung einer depressiven Episode beteiligt sein. Diätetische Maßnahmen vermögen das neurobiochemische Geschehen dergestalt zu beeinflussen, dass die Depressivität vor allem stressanfälliger Personen gemildert wird. Die Empfehlung einer Erhöhung der Kohlenhydrat- auf Kosten der Protein-Zufuhr zielt auf eine gesteigerte Synthese des Neurotransmitters Serotonin ab, die einer Erhöhung der Omega-3- zu Lasten der Omega-6-Fettsäure-Zufuhr auf eine verringerte Synthese von proinflammatorischen Zytokinen. Darüber hinaus soll eine bedarfsgerechte Versorgung mit Vitaminen vor Defiziten schützen, die sich in neuropsychiatrischen Symptomen äußern können. Eine dauerhafte Ernährungsumstellung bietet sich neben dem Erlernen von Stressbewältigngsstrategien ganz besonders unter präventiven Gesichtspunkten an, zumal die Empfehlungen in dieselbe Richtung weisen wie die grundlegenden Ernährungsrichtlinien für Leistungssportler. Bei klinisch manifesten Depressionen können Diättherapie, Entspannungs- und Atemtechniken sowie diverse Naturheilverfahren (etwa traditionelle chinesische Medizin, Homöopathie) begleitend angewandt werden, nicht jedoch die tragende Beziehung zu einem Psychotherapeuten ersetzen.

Experiment I bezieht sich auf den Einfluss pro- und retrospektiver Vortrainingsprozeduren auf subjektive Vorstellungsstrategien und das motorische Lernen. In Experiment II wurde der Einfluss pro- und retrospektiver Vortrainingsprozeduren und entsprechender Vorstellungsprozesse auf subjektive Vorstellungsstrategien und das motorische Lernen analysiert. Die Ergebnisse weisen darauf, dass zusätzliche positive Lerneffekte von pro- oder retrospektiven Vortrainingsprozeduren ohne die bewusste und willentliche Implikation zeitlich entsprechend orientierter Vorstellungsprozesse während des motorischen Lernprozesses nicht auftreten.

Zunächst werden Theorien und Modelle der Gesundheit und Gesundheitsförderung vorgestellt. Danach wird erörtert, ob der im Erwachsenenalter zu beobachtende Rückgang der körperlichen Funktionsfähigkeit ein natürlicher, altersbedingter und damit nicht zu beeinflussender Vorgang ist oder durch regelmäßige körperlich-sportliche Aktivität aufgehalten werden kann. Weiter wird dargelegt, wie sportlich aktiv deutsche Ältere sind, welche Motive für Aktivität existieren und welche Barrieren es zu überwinden gilt, damit Ältere regelmäßig sportlich aktiv sind. Danach werden die vielfältigen Wirkungen von Sport auf die physische und psychische Gesundheit vorgestellt. In einem modifizierten Anforderungs-Ressourcen-Modell werden dann die Zusammenhänge von körperlich-sportlicher Aktivität und gesundem Altern integriert. Im folgenden Kapitel wird die Vorgehensweise der Autoren bei der Planung gesundheitssportlicher und sporttherapeutischer Interventionen vorgestellt. Gleichzeitig werden Tipps und Informationen für die eigenständige Konzeption indikationsspezifischer Programme gegeben. Danach werden anhand einiger ausgewählter Praxiskonzepte die Ziele, Inhalte und Methoden einer körper-, bewegungs- und sportbezogenen Gesundheitsförderung verdeutlicht.

AB - Das Fußballspiel wird als eine besondere Form des Gruppenprozesses aus gruppenanalytischer Perspektive betrachtet. Dabei wird, anknüpfend an Elias und Dunning, das Spiel von zwei Mannschaften als sich permanent verändernde Figuration verstanden, die den Aktionen der einzelnen Akteure ihren Sinn gibt. Aus dieser Perspektive werden Spielsysteme und Spielprozesse sowie das Verhältnis von Psychodynamik und Gruppendynamik im Fußball behandelt. Außerdem werden auch die Teamentwicklung, die Aufgaben des Trainers und die Frage von gruppenanalytischem Coaching im Fußball diskutiert.

AB - Die Problematik der Arbeitsplatzunsicherheit bei Fußballtrainern ("Schleudersitz Trainerstuhl" und ihre Bedeutung für Burnoutphänomene wird explorativ untersucht. Aktive und ehemalige Cheftrainer der höchsten drei deutschen Ligen, also der ersten und zweiten Bundesliga sowie der Regionalligen, wurden befragt. Hierbei kamen sowohl Fragebögen als auch Interviews zum Einsatz. Es konnten spezifische ursächliche Bedingungen, Strategien und Konsequenzen rund um den Kontext der Arbeitsplatzunsicherheit herausgearbeitet werden. Diese wurden anhand Ihrer Bedeutsamkeit in Rangreihen gebracht und interpretiert. Es stellte sich unter anderem heraus, dass bestimmte Risikofaktoren wie Erfolglosigkeit, Tabellenplatz und Konflikte mit dem Präsidium, der Mannschaft oder den Medien sehr bedeutsam für die (In-)Stabilität des Arbeitsplatzes sind und andere, wie z. B. Hierarchieprobleme in der Vereinsführung oder in der Mannschaft bzw. der ansteigende Erwartungsdruck von Sponsoren ebenfalls eine Rolle spielen. Konträre Rollenaufgaben, gesundheitliche Probleme oder fehlende Loyalität innerhalb des Trainerteams sind hingegen ohne großes Einflusspotenzial. Die Bedeutung der einzelnen Bedingungen wird zusätzlich durch die Höhe der Spielklasse und den vergangenen Erfolgen moderiert, das heißt indirekt verstärkt oder abgeschwächt. Bei den berufsspezifischen und außerberuflichen Konsequenzen der Arbeitsplatzunsicherheit konnten nicht viele eindeutige Befunde abgeleitet werden. Der Verlust der Autorität im Verein wurde aber von der Hälfte der Befragten bestätigt. Mehr als die Hälfte gab an, unter fehlender Entspannung und Schlafstörungen zu leiden, die sie auf die Arbeitsplatzunsicherheit zurückführen. Ein Drittel klagte über Kopfschmerzen. Sämtliche Konsequenzen können durch finanziellen Ausgleich, zwischenmenschliche Beziehungen und die Unterstützung des Partners moderiert werden. Ein sehr bedeutsames Ergebnis ist, dass es, im Gegensatz zu Forschungsbefunden aus anderen Berufsfeldern, nicht zu einer erniedrigten Anstrengung, erhöhten Kündigungsbereitschaft sowie erhöhten Widerstand gegen Veränderungen beim Vorliegen von Arbeitsplatzunsicherheit kommt. Es muss eher von den gegenteiligen Reaktionen ausgegangen werden. Dies hätte zur Folge, dass andere Interventionen bei der wirtschaftlichen und gesundheitlichen Optimierung des Berufs erforderlich sind. Insgesamt liegt in der professionellen Fußballtrainerbranche schon bei der Arbeitsaufnahme eine chronische Arbeitsplatzunsicherheit vor. Die chronische Arbeitsplatzunsicherheit führt zu verstärkter Rivalität, die allerdings von der Mehrheit nicht offen gezeigt wird. Eines der Untersuchungsziele bestand in der Integration des Burnoutphänomens in die Konzeption der Arbeitsplatzunsicherheit. Es zeigte sich, dass es bei Misserfolg zu signifikant höheren Burnout-Ausprägungen kommt als bei Erfolg. Dennoch liegt auch im Erfolgsfall ein erhöhtes Risiko des "Ausbrennens" für Trainer vor. Der Trainer ist somit während der gesamten Tätigkeit einem erhöhten Burnoutrisiko ausgesetzt. Letztendlich kann in der vorliegenden Studie Burnout als alternative Konsequenz zur Entlassung angesehen werden.

AB - Ein Ansatz zur Konzeption eines spezifischen Fortbildungsmoduls für den Auf- und Ausbau sozialer Kompetenzen von Übungsleiterinnen und -leitern im Sport im Umgang mit Störungen im Trainingsablauf wird vorgestellt. Nach der Auswahl geeigneter Interventionen wurden zunächst die Bedürfnisse und Handlungsprobleme der Sporttrainer untersucht. Daten wurden im Rahmen einer offenen Befragung von 54 Trainerinnen und 27 Trainern in Seminaren hessischer Sportverbände erhoben. Erfragt wurden häufig erlebte Störungssituationen im Training. Es ergaben sich Hinweise auf eine sinnvolle inhaltliche Gliederung der geplanten Fortbildungsmaßnahme. Weiterhin zeigte sich, dass verschiedene Untergruppen von Trainerinnen und Trainern unterschiedliche Störungsschwerpunkte hervorheben. So erleben etwa Trainer in Mannschaftssportarten mehr Konflikte und Aggressionen; im Leistungssport werden seltener Störungen durch Kinder und Jugendliche und häufiger durch Eltern angegeben als im Breitensport. Es wird betont, dass sich auf der Grundlage der Untersuchungsergebnisse der Schwerpunkt des Aus- und Fortbildungsbedarfs von Übungsleiterinnen und -leitern bestimmen lassen.

AB - Die Bedeutung von Werten im Sport wird aus soziologischer Perspektive erörtert. Das soziale Handeln im Sport wird nicht nur von Normen bestimmt, sondern auch von Werten beeinflusst und gelenkt. Aus der kulturell verankerten Wertorientierung resultiert die stabilisierende Funktion, die Werte somit auch im Sportsystem innehaben. Allerdings sind Wertorientierungen nicht immer widerspruchsfrei, und gerade im Sport findet sich eine Fülle von Wertkonflikten, die im sozialen Handeln jeweils situationsadäquat vom Handelnden gelöst werden müssen. Im Rahmen einer Differenzierung zwischen produktiven, moralischen und rituellen Wertungen können solche Wertkonflikte aus der gegenseitigen Überlagerung dieser Typen von Wertungen erklärt werden. So stellt die Trainerposition im Spitzensport eine Position dar, die, wie andere Positionen in diesem Bereich auch, durch die Verlagerungen dieser Konflikte in die Position hinein gekennzeichnet ist. Damit werden gleichzeitig unterschiedliche Wertorientierungen für das Handeln des Trainers relevant. An diesem Beispiel werden für das Sportsystem typische Formen der Vermittlung zwischen den Ansprüchen, die aus unterschiedlichen Wertorientierungen resultieren, dargestellt. Gemeinsames Muster dieses Prozesses der Vermittlung ist die jeweils situativ geprägte Generierung einer Wertehierarchie, die zur Begründung der jeweiligen Handlung dient.

Bereits während der Wettkampfvorbereitung erfüllt der Austausch von Informationen eine Katalysatorfunktion. Der Prozess eines systematischen Debriefings wird skizziert. Außerdem wird ein Modell vorgestellt, das beschreibt, wie Athleten unter Einbezug ihrer Probleme und Meinungen eine positive Leistungsentwicklung haben. Spezifische Empfehlungen für eine effektive Anwendung werden ebenso dargestellt. Richtig angewandtes Debriefing gewährleistet den Austausch von wichtigen Informationen, der eine optimale mentale und emotionale Erholung jedes Athleten ermöglicht.

AB - Ein Untersuchungsansatz zur Frage, wie sich sollwertorientierte und istwertbezogene Vorstellungsprozesse auf das Bewegungslernen auswirken, wird vorgestellt. Es werden zunächst theoretische Grundlagen des mentalen Trainings dargestellt. Anschließend werden zwei verschiedene Versuchsbedingungen zur Generierung von Bewegungsvorstellungen beschrieben: (1) Videografische Darbietung des Sollwertes mit anschließend viermaliger, ausschließlich sollwertorientierter Bewegungsvorstellung; (2) Wiederholung der Versuchsbedingung 1 mit Ergänzung um einen einmaligen aufmerksamkeitslenkenden Hinweis in einer späteren Phase des Lernprozesses. Versuchspersonen beider Bedingungen wurden einem Vortraining zur Generierung und Nutzung von kinästhetischen Bewegungsvorstellungen unterzogen. Dabei wurden im Wesentlichen drei Erkenntisse gewonnen: (1) unmittelbar nach Beginn des Lernprozesses schien die Aufforderung zur sollwertorientierten Bewegungsvorstellung nicht zur Leistungsentwicklung beizutragen; (2) im zweiten Zeitabschnitt des Lernprozesses wurden unter Vorstellungsbedingungen signifikant größere Leistungsverbesserungen erzielt als gegenüber den Kontrollbedingungen; (3) aufmerksamkeitslenkende Hinweise, verbunden mit Vorstellungsprozessen, führten in einer späteren Phase des Lernprozesses gegenüber Kontrollbedingungen, aber auch gegenüber einer ausschließlich sollwertorientierten Vorstellungsbedingung zu signifikant größeren Leistungssteigerungen. Auf der Grundlage dieser Daten werden Vorüberlegungen für einen Untersuchungsplan und letztlich ein Untersuchungsansatz dargestellt. Dieser sieht eine laborexperimentelle Untersuchung zu Einsatz und Wirkung einerseits sollwertorientierter und andererseits istwertbezogener Vorstellungsprozesse und deren Effekte auf das Bewegungslernen vor.

AB - In einer Pilotstudie wurden der Einsatz eines computergestützten Messplatzes zur Erfassung der kognitiven Repräsentation der Bewegungstechnik im Brustschwimmen und deren Veränderung durch Mentales Training und die Auswirkungen des Trainigs auf die Bewegungsausführung unter realen Bedingungen überprüft. Dabei wurden vier Zielstellungen verfolgt: Analyse kognitiver Repräsentationen über den Bewegungsablauf des Brustschwimmens bei einer 17-jährigen Leistungsschwimmerin, Entwicklung von Aufgabenstellungen, die sich zur Korrektur fehlerhafter kognitiver Repräsentationen eignen, Überprüfung des mentalen Lernprozesses, Ermittlung der Wirkungen veränderter kognitiver Repräsentationen auf die Bewegungsausführung. Im Versuchsablauf erfolgte die Erfassung kognitiver Repräsentationen mit Hilfe von Bildzuordnungsaufgaben am Computerarbeitsplatz, der aus einem Rechner und zwei gekoppelten Monitoren besteht. Dabei hatte die Schwimmerin drei Aufgabentypen zu bearbeiten: (1) aus maximal zwölf zufällig angeordneten Schwimmzügen sollte der Gesamtzug zusammengestellt werden; (2) einer Folge von Arm- und Beinfiguretten sollten die eigenen Arm- und Beinbewegungen zugeordnet werden; (3) zwei Bilder aus einem Schwimmvideo wurden in einem zufälligen zeitlichen Abstand dargestellt. Die Sportlerin hatte eine definierte Anzahl von Zwischenpositionen so zu konfigurieren, dass diese Zwischenpositionen mit gleichem Zeitintervall aufeinanderfolgen. Zur Erfassung bewegungsstruktureller Parameter des Brustschwimmens erfolgten Aufnahmen in einem Strömungskanal mit stufenweise einstellbarer Strömungsgeschwindigkeit. Der Auswertung erfolgte über eine Zeitreihenanalyse ausgewählter kinematischer Kennlinien, die Bestimmung von Bewegungsphasen entsprechend eines Modellansatzes und eine Analyse phasenbezogener kinematischer Kennwerte. Für die Pilotstudie wurde ein quasiexperimentelles Design gewählt. Die drei Überprüfungen (Ausgangs-, Zwischen- und Endniveau) wurden standardisiert, die dazwischen liegenden mentalen Trainingsphasen jedoch ständig dem Könnensstand der Sportlerin angepasst. Folgende Ergebnisse wurden ermittelt: Beim Bewegungsablauf ergab sich ein zeitlich ungünstiger Zusammenhang von Arm- und Beinbewegung. Analog dazu konnten auch Fehler in der kognitiven Repräsentation der zeitlichen Abfolge zeigen lassen. Die Bestimmung des Endniveaus ergab eine deutliche Verbesserung der kognitiven Repräsentationen des zeitlichen Verlaufes der Bewegung.

AB - Der Einfluss volitionaler Kontrollprozesse von Fußballtrainern auf die Beurteilung der Leistung der von ihnen betreuten Spieler wird untersucht. Dabei wird die Hypothese überprüft, dass die durch eine dispositionale Handlungsorientierung begünstigten volitionalen Kontrollprozesse der planenden Bewusstseinslagen dazu führen, dass Trainer diejenigen Spieler, für die sie sich bereits vor dem Abschlusstraining entschieden haben, parteiisch im Sinne ihrer Absicht bewerten. Dagegen ist für Trainer, die sich vor dem Abschlusstraining noch nicht hinsichtlich einer Alternative der Mannschaftsaufstellung entschieden haben, nicht mit einer Beeinflussung durch die dispositionelle Handlungsorientierung zu rechnen. Daten wurden im Rahmen eines Laborexperiments an einer Stichprobe von 65 B-Lizenz-Traineranwärtern erhoben. Es ergaben sich Hinweise darauf, dass zur Erklärung der im Alltag häufig zu findenden übertriebenen Rückendeckung mancher Spieler durch ihre Trainer sowohl dispositionelle als auch situative Merkmale herangezogen werden müssen. Die Befunde werden gedeutet als warnender Hinweis für Trainer, dass sie möglicherweise Spieler, die vorzeitig für zukünftige Spiele nominiert sind, nicht mehr objektiv beurteilen können.

Die Grundintervention besteht darin, dass der Klient mit den Augen den raschen Fingerbewegungen des Coaches (von rechts nach links und umgekehrt) folgt. Diese schnellen Augenbewegungen werden als "wache" REM-Phasen aufgefasst. Die Methode des Wingwave-Coachings versteht sich als eine Weiterentwicklung der EMDR-Methode für den Spitzenleistungsbereich und als Kurzzeit-Coaching-Konzept für ein rasches, körperlich spürbares Stressmanagement und zur Kreativitätssteigerung. Bisherige Erfahrungen belegen die Wirksamkeit im Rahmen der Stressregulation. Positive Coaching-Ergebnisse waren häufig auch nach einem halben Jahr noch stabil.

AB - Presents a review of simple heuristics and how they can be applied to sports. First, the concept of simple heuristics is introduced. They are described as rules of thumb that are based on the building blocks of decision making: how to search for information, stop information search, and decide quickly and accurately. It is discussed how they can help understand the decisions made by athletes, coaches, referees, managers, and fans in tasks involving high uncertainty, such as predicting tournament outcomes, allocating balls to teammates, or determining when to buy or sell a talented player. Then, an "adaptive toolbox" of such heuristics is presented, that is, a collection of strategies that work effectively in specific environments. Moreover, building blocks are added that explain motor behavior itself, which is considered central to many sport applications. Finally, as a guide for future applications, principles for studying the use of simple heuristics by individuals involved in sports are presented.

AB - Im Rahmen von Überlegungen zur Bedeutung von Smalltalk und Netzwerkpflege im Leistungssport werden die professionelle Gesprächsführung und Redefähigkeit als Grundkonstanten für ein erfolgreiches Sport- und Trainingsmanagement ausgewiesen. Primäres Ziel ist dabei der Ausgleich von Beziehungs- und Sachsignalen und ein respektvoller Umgang miteinander. Da dies bedingt durch den Druck im Wettkampfsport und durch die Leistungsanforderungen die Athleten nicht immer leicht fällt, tritt mit dem Smalltalk eine - oft unbeachtete - Sonderform menschlicher Kommunikationsformen in den Vordergrund. Es wird herausgearbeitet, dass diese Art der Kommunikation, so banal sie oft erscheint, ein sehr geeignetes Mittel für Kontaktaufbau und Netzwerkpflege darstellt. Eine Betrachtung unter strategischem Aspekt offenbart die diagnostischen Qualitäten des Smalltalks: Wie "tickt" ein Athlet oder Trainingspartner? Welche Eitelkeiten und Sorgen prägen ihn? Wie stellt man sich auf ihn ein, wenn es um Leistungsgrenzen und damit oft um Existenzsicherung geht? Hinweise zu seiner zieleffizienten Durchführung von Smalltalk werden gegeben.

AB - Mentales Training (MT) im Sinne der planmäßig wiederholten Vorstellung eines Bewegungsablaufes ist ein zentraler Gegenstand sportpsychologischer Forschung. Im Hochleistungssport und in der Rehabilitation wird es zur Optimierung von Bewegungen eingesetzt. Einen Erklärungsansatz der Trainingswirkung bietet die Simulationstheorie mit dem zentralen Postulat, dass Bewegungsausführung und -vorstellung gleiche neuronale Strukturen aktivieren (funktionale Äquivalenz). Diese Annahme wurde mittels verschiedener neurophysiologischer Methoden geprüft, die teils zu widersprüchlichen Befunden führten. Die Elektroenzephalographie (EEG) kann nach Ansicht der Autoren dabei helfen, Lücken im theoretischen Erkenntnisprozess zu schließen. In einem Überblick wird über die aktuelle Befundlage zum Mentalen Training mittels EEG referiert. Es sollen drei wesentliche Vorteile der Methode aufgezeigt werden: (1) Das EEG liefert Maße der neurophysiologischen Aktivität mit hoher zeitlicher Auflösung. (2) Technische Weiterentwicklungen (drahtlose Hardware, tragbare Ausrüstung) erlauben die notwendige Bewegungsfreiheit für eine Anwendung im Sportkontext. (3) In der Rehabilitation kann die Vorstellung von Bewegungen als mentale Strategie dienen, um eine Neuroprothese auf Basis von Hirnsignalen zu steuern.

AB - Die Sportpsychologie bietet in Deutschland ein sich rasch entwickelndes neues Berufsfeld (Ehrlenspiel, Droste & Beckmann. 2009). In den meisten Sportarten komplettieren Sportpsychologen bereits seit längerer Zeit den Betreuerstab der Athleten. Im Fußball hat diese Entwicklung erst in den letzten Jahren begonnen. Deshalb liegen zum Einsatz sportpsychologischen Trainings bzw. dem Kenntnisstand über diesbezügliche Maßnahmen im Fußball bisher noch keine Studien vor. Ziel der vorliegenden Studie ist es daher, den Kenntnisstand und die tatsächliche Anwendung sportpsychologischer Maßnahmen bei Fußballtrainern verschiedener Lizenzstufen zu untersuchen. Die Befragung basiert auf einer Stichprobe von insgesamt 149 Trainern. Als zentrales Ergebnis lässt sich konstatieren, dass dem sportpsychologischen Training von fast allen Trainern eine große Bedeutung zugesprochen wird, der Kenntnisstand jedoch äußerst lückenhaft ist und der Einsatz entsprechender Intervention kaum stattfindet.

So können Probleme in Trainerteams eingehender erklärt werden. Insbesondere gilt es, Diskrepanzen oder Überschneidungen von Selbstwert und sozialer Identität herauszuarbeiten. Auf dieser Basis werden Vorschläge für Interventionsmaßnahmen entwickelt, wodurch kollektive Zielsetzungen und soziale Identität gestärkt werden.

AB - Die vorliegende Übersichtsarbeit stellt die Literatur zu psychischen Störungen in der Domäne des Leistungssports dar. Dabei wird deutlich: Psychische Störungen sind in der Welt herausragender sportlicher Leistungen relativ gesehen weniger wahrscheinlich; ein von psychischen Störungen betroffener Spitzensportler kann aber vor der Situation stehen, mit überfordernden psychischen Problemen in einer besonders leistungsbezogenen Welt allein zu bleiben, obwohl er von Fachleuten aus Sport und Medizin umgeben ist. Lösungen für dieses Problem lägen in einer größeren Akzeptanz wissenschaftlich bewährter diagnostischer und psychotherapeutischer Methoden und in einer engeren interdisziplinären Kooperation.

AB - Es wird davon ausgegangen, dass die Nahrungsaufnahme von Topathletinnen und -athleten anforderungsgerecht und verantwortungsbewusst erfolgen sollte: Anforderungsgerecht im Hinblick auf den erhöhten Energie- und Flüssigkeitsbedarf; verantwortungsbewusst, weil die Verbesserung der Leistung nicht selten durch ein geringeres Körpergewicht erreicht werden soll. Erfolgt die Gewichtsreduktion jedoch über einen langen Zeitraum hinweg übertrieben und unkontrolliert, birgt sie die Gefahr einer Essverhaltensstörung. Die Rolle von Trainerinnen und Trainern ist dabei zumeist nur ein Randthema, obwohl diesem Personenkreis in Fragen Sportart und leistungsgerechter Ernährung eine Schlüsselrolle zukommt. In einer umfangreichen Untersuchung zu diesem Problembereich wurden 45 zumeist höher qualifizierte Trainerinnen und Trainer aus unterschiedlichen Sportarten zu Fragen der Ernährung und Essverhaltensstörungen interviewt. Die Sportarten lassen sich den vier Gruppen Ausdauersportarten, Sportarten mit Gewichtsklassen, Ästhetische Sportarten und Spielsportarten zuordnen. Es wurde geprüft, ob sich im Hinblick auf die Bedeutung von Ernährung und Essverhaltensstörungen Unterschiede zwischen den so genannten Risikosportarten untereinander und gegenüber den Spielsportarten ergeben. Die Ergebnisse zeigen deutliche Unterschiede, aber insgesamt ein begrüßenswertes Problembewusstsein auf Seiten der Trainerinnen und Trainer und deren Wunsch nach verstärkter Berücksichtigung von Fragen sportartgerechter Ernährung im Rahmen der Trainerausbildungen. In der Diskussion werden Hinweise auf eine Optimierung der Ausbildungsinhalte sowie Empfehlungen für den verantwortungsbewussten Umgang mit Athletinnen und Athleten gegeben.

AB - In den letzten Jahren beobachtet man einen fast inflationären Gebrauch des Begriffs Herausforderung in unterschiedlichen Lebensbereichen, so auch im Spitzensport. Kritisch reflektiert wird, was der Begriff Herausforderung eigentlich meint und ob alles wirklich nur eine Herausforderung für den Sportler ist oder ob es auch bedrohliche Situationen vor und während des Wettkampfgeschehens gibt. In Auseinandersetzung mit dem Konzept der Herausforderung und Bedrohung wird anhand vieler Beispiele aufgezeigt, welche Konsequenzen sich für den Spitzensport ergeben. Es werden Vorschläge gemacht, was im Vorfeld von Wettkämpfen getan bzw. vermieden werden sollte, damit Sportler den Wettkampf als Herausforderung betrachten können. Darüber hinaus wird deutlich gemacht, dass es ebenso wichtig ist, psychische Anforderungen des Wettkampfs in das Training zu integrieren, damit Sportler lernen, unter Druck bzw. in Bedrohungssituationen handlungsfähig zu bleiben.

AB - Das Thema psychische Erkrankungen im Leistungssport wurde aufgrund prominenter Einzelfälle in den letzten Jahren immer wieder öffentlich diskutiert. Dennoch ist dieses Thema weitgehend tabuisiert und stigmatisiert. Ein Grund hierfür könnte die Unsicherheit darüber sein, wie mit diesem sensiblen Thema umgegangen werden soll. Auf diesem Hintergrund wird ein kurzer Überblick über die Entstehung psychischer Erkrankungen gegeben und die häufigsten psychischen Erkrankungen (Depressionen, Angststörungen, somatoforme Störungen, Essstörungen) werden skizziert. Die Ausführungen sollen dabei helfen, den Beteiligten im System Leistungssport einen offenen und kompetenten Umgang mit der Thematik zu ermöglichen. Darüber hinaus werden die Aufgaben und Grenzen der angewandten Sportpsychologie veranschaulicht und es werden einige Forderungen an das Verbundsystem Leistungssport - unter anderem die Position des Leipziger Sportpsychologie Kreises (LSPK e. V.) - abgeleitet.

AB - Im Rahmen von Überlegungen zu sportpsychologischen Interventionsmaßnahmen im Leistungssport von Sportlern mit Behinderung wurde eine Studie durchgeführt, die eine Bestands- und Bedarfsanalyse sportpsychologischer Beratung und Betreuung im Behindertenleistungssport vorstellt. An der Studie haben 78 paralympische Sportler und 12 Bundestrainer aus paralympischen Sportarten im Rahmen einer Onlinebefragung teilgenommen. Neben demographischen Daten wurden dabei folgende thematischen Bereiche erfasst: bisherige Kenntnis von sportpsychologischen Maßnahmen, bisheriger Einsatz von sportpsychologischen Maßnahmen und Ermittlung des Bedarfs an sportpsychologischen Maßnahmen. Es wurden deskriptive Maße bestimmt und nonparametrische Verfahren zur Überprüfung von Gruppenunterschieden angewendet. Zusammengefasst zeigten die Ergebnisse, dass (1) nur jeder zweite Sportler und Trainer auf praktische Erfahrung mit sportpsychologischen Maßnahmen verweisen kann, (2) ein fehlender qualifizierter Ansprechpartner und fehlende finanzielle Mittel als Hauptgründe dafür genannt werden, (3) nur eine Minderheit der Sportler über fundiertes sportpsychologisches Wissen verfügt, (4) psychologisches Training sowohl von Sportlern als auch von Trainern als effektiv und wichtig für die Leistungsentwicklung eingeschätzt wird und (5) Sportler und Trainer sich zukünftig wünschten, sportpsychologische Beratungs- und Betreuungsangebote in Zusammenarbeit mit einem qualifizierten Sportpsychologen in Anspruch nehmen zu können. Es wird die Auffassung vertreten, dass die Verantwortlichen an Trainingsstätten dazu anzuhalten sind, entsprechende sportpsychologische Angebote zu entwickeln und anzubieten.

AB - Das zentrale Ziel der sportpsychologischen Betreuung im Spitzensport ist die Leistungsoptimierung. Bereits im Anschluss an die Olympischen Spiele in Athen wurde der Versuch unternommen, die Ergebnisqualität der sportpsychologischen Betreuung hinsichtlich qualitativer und quantitativer Kriterien zu evaluieren (Eberspächer et al., 2005). Obwohl die Ergebnisse von damals zu einer durchaus positiven Beurteilung der Ergebnisqualität der sportpsychologischen Betreuung führten, ist insbesondere ein quantitativer Zugang über Medaillen oder Platzierungen äußerst kritisch zu bewerten (vgl. Mayer et al., 2009); denn das Kriterium der optimalen Leistung zum Wettkampfhöhepunkt ist nicht ohne weiteres mit Medaillen und Platzierungen gleichzusetzen und damit die Beurteilung der Ergebnisqualität mit derartigen Kriterien allein nicht aussagekräftig. Neben der Ergebnisqualität sind auch Prozess- und Strukturqualität von entscheidender Bedeutung, wobei die drei Qualitätsaspekte nicht völlig unabhängig voneinander betrachtet werden können (Graf & Janssens, 2008). Die Prozessqualität, also die Qualität des Betreuungsprozesses, darf im vorliegenden Fall als ein wichtiger Prädiktor für Ergebnisqualität angenommen werden. Bei der Einschätzung der Prozessqualität ist die Trainereinschätzung ein wichtiges Kriterium. Der Trainer koordiniert sämtliche leistungsoptimierenden Maßnahmen, muss diese sowohl fördern als auch einfordern. Er hat dadurch aus Sicht der Sportpsychologie eine wichtige Türöffner- und Multiplikatorenfunktion, weshalb seine Unterstützung und Zufriedenheit eine hohe Bedeutung für die Akzeptanz und letztlich auch die Wirksamkeit sportpsychologischer Maßnahmen innehat. Die Wahrnehmung der Qualität der sportpsychologischen Arbeit aus Trainersicht ist daher Ansatz der vorliegenden Arbeit. Diese Arbeit stellt eine Vorstudie zu einer vom Deutschen Olympischen Sportbund (DOSB) in Auftrag gegebenen Bundestrainerbefragung zur Qualität der sportpsychologischen Betreuung dar, die im Jahr 2010 in Kooperation mit dem vom Bundesinstitut für Sportwissenschaft (BiSp) initiierten Projekt zur Qualitätssicherung der sportpsychologischen Betreuung im deutschen Spitzensport (2009 bis 2012; Projektleiter: Brand & Kleinert) durchgeführt werden soll. Die nachfolgend vorgestellten Analysen haben vorwiegend explorativen Charakter, lassen jedoch bereits bestimmte Tendenzen in Bezug auf die Qualitätswahrnehmung durch die Trainer erkennen. Die Informationsgewinnung erfolgte aus einer individuell frei gestaltbaren Bewertung heraus, um die Sicht- und Denkweise des jeweiligen Trainers möglichst unbeeinflusst in den Mittelpunkt zu stellen. Als theoretisches Fundament für diese Evaluation wurden relevante Modelle der Dienstleistungsqualität und des individuellen Konstruktivismus (Kelly 1955; 1991) herangezogen.

Im Rahmen des Projekts wurden mit 100 Kindern acht Wochen lang ein spezifisches Musik-, Tanz- oder Bewegungstraining und in einer Kontrollgruppe ein Zuwendungstraining durchgeführt. Vor und nach der Intervention wurde mittels Elektroenzephalogramm (EEG) die Hirnaktivität während einer mentalen Rotation gemessen. Auf der Verhaltensebene wurden die Reaktionszeiten bei der Aufgabe und die Leistung erfasst. Im Posttest wurde eine deutliche Steigerung der Reaktionszeiten in der Tanzgruppe festgestellt. Für diese Gruppe wurde auch eine erhöhte neuronale Aktivität bei den EEG-Messungen ermittelt.

Körperliche Aktivität kann altersbedingte Abbauprozesse aufhalten und die psychische Gesundheit sowie die kognitive und körperliche Leistungsfähigkeit fördern. Im zweiten Teil des Buches wird eine Studie vorgestellt, deren Ziel es war, den Alternsprozess durch körperliche Aktivität positiv zu beeinflussen und die psychische Gesundheit sowie kognitive und körperliche Leistungsfähigkeit zu verbessern. In der Studie wurden ein Krafttraining und kombiniertes Kraft- und Ausdauertraining auf ihre Effektivität in den Bereichen psychische Gesundheit, kognitive Funktionen und körperliche Leistungsfähigkeit bei Senioren über 60 Jahren untersucht.

AB - In der Praxis der Sportarten, besonders bei denen mit unmittelbarer Auseinandersetzung zwischen Gegnern, wird immer häufiger davon gesprochen, dass der Gegner gelesen werden soll. Mit dieser Metapher ist die Kompetenz im Handeln eines Sportlers unmittelbar vor dem Wettkampf und während des Wettkampfs gemeint, Absichten eines Gegners zu erkennen und zum eigenen Vorteil zu nutzen. Die Ausbildung dieser Kompetenz, den Gegner lesen zu können, erfolgt über einen längeren, zwischen Trainer und Sportler bewusst gestalteten Prozess. Sie umfasst die Leistungsvoraussetzungen Assoziations-, Antizipations-, Beurteilungsfähigkeit, Fähigkeit zur Steuerung von Emotionen und Wettkampferfahrungen, die komplex miteinander verbunden sind.

AB - Die Fußball-WM der Frauen ist vorüber. Das frühe Ausscheiden der deutschen Mannschaft im Viertelfinale gegen Japan war enttäuschend und stand im krassen Widerspruch zu der im Vorfeld des Turniers geschürten Erwartungshaltung. Der für diese Sportart bislang nicht gekannte Medienhype ging mit Erwartungen einher, die für die Akteure neu gewesen sein dürften. Dadurch ausgelöster Druck kann dazu führen, dass Leistungsanforderungen nicht mehr unter dem Aspekt der Herausforderung, sondern unter dem der Bedrohung wahrgenommen werden. Ein professionelles Erwartungsmanagement stellt unter solchen Voraussetzungen einen wichtigen Erfolgsfaktor dar. Die Ausführungen werden anhand einer Darstellung der Theorie der Herausforderung und Bedrohung im Spitzensport verdeutlicht.

Es zeigt sich, dass Bewegung und Sport nicht nur die physische Gesundheit positiv beeinflussen, sondern dass auch psychosoziale Effekte zu finden sind, die auf körperlicher Aktivität beruhen. Die Wirkung eines körperlich aktiven Lebensstils auf die psychische Gesundheit ist von moderierenden Variablen abhängig, etwa der Art und Intensität der Aktivität. Es wird primär Literatur zu moderater, gesundheits- und fitnessorientierter Aktivität vorgestellt. Abschließend wird auf die Bedeutung des Aufbaus eines habituierten Bewegungsverhaltens hingewiesen und darauf, welche Bezüge zwischen Urlaubs- und Alltagsverhalten angestrebt werden könnten.

AB - Hänsel, Werkmann, Schulz und Kappes (in Leistungssport, 2013, 43 (2)) haben eine mehrdimensionale Systematik subjektiver Qualitätsaspekte für den Nachwuchsleistungs- und Spitzensport aus der Perspektive von Athleten und Trainern vorgestellt. Die Systematik basiert auf einer Befragung von 52 Athleten und 46 Trainern zu kritischen Ereignissen, also Ereignissen außergewöhnlich positiver oder negativer Natur (Schlüsselerlebnisse). Auf dieser Basis werden die Unterschiede und Gemeinsamkeiten von Athleten und Trainern in der subjektiven Wahrnehmung der Qualitätsaspekte vorgestellt. Zuvor wird begründet, warum die Berücksichtigung der unterschiedlichen Perspektiven in Trainer-Athlet-Dyaden sinnvoll ist. Es zeigen sich deutliche Unterschiede zwischen Athleten und Trainern sowohl bei der Wahl der Qualitätsmerkmale als auch bei der Bewertung dieser Merkmale. Athleten tendieren eher dazu, persönliche Beziehungen und private Lebensumstände zu fokussieren, Trainer dagegen eher strukturell-organisatorische Aspekte des Sportsystems. Trainer und Athleten sollten also nicht von einer grundsätzlichen Übereinstimmung der Perspektiven ausgehen. Die systematische Berücksichtigung unterschiedlicher Perspektiven ist zur Optimierung der Zusammenarbeit in Trainer-Athlet-Dyaden und damit für ein erfolgreiches Trainerhandeln sinnvoll.

Nach einer Einführung in die Symptomatik der Schizophrenie und verschiedener Sportprogramme für Schizophrenieerkrankte werden gesundheitsbezogene Auswirkungen dieser Sportangebote analysiert. In Anlehnung an den mehrdimensionalen Gesundheitsbegriff der "World Health Organization" werden Studien über Auswirkungen von Sport auf die wahrgenommene Lebensqualität, auf körperliche und soziale Aspekte von Gesundheit, auf die psychische Gesundheit und auf psychische Determinanten des Gesundheitsverhaltens dargestellt. Aus den Ergebnissen wird gefolgert, dass Sportprogramme die Negativsymtomatik bei Schizophreniekranken reduzieren und sich unter Umständen sogar lindernd auf die Positivsymptomatik auswirken können. Zudem werden positive Effekte auf die psychische und körperliche Facette der Lebensqualität angenommen. In einem Ausblick werden schließlich zukünftige Forschungsanliegen skizziert.

Dazu wird eine Untersuchung an 24 erfahrenen und 27 unerfahrenen Trainern zum Fehlersehen dargestellt. Die Trainer sollten Fehler in Videoaufnahmen von mehreren übereinandergelegten Clips (Kugelstoß und Basketball-Sprungwurf) benennen. Tatsächlich waren erfahrene Trainer bei diesen "vermaschten" Aufnahmen nicht besser als Traineranfänger. Konsequenterweise muss das Expertenwissen erfahrener - und vielleicht auch eingefahrener - Trainer mit Hilfe genauester Bewegungsanalysen zunächst aufgebrochen werden. So kann Objektivität wiedergewonnen werden.

AB - In einer empirischen Studie wird geprüft, ob Erkenntnisse der Sportpsychologie im Leistungsbasketball bekannt sind, in ihrer Bedeutung richtig eingeschätzt und in Training und Wettkampf angewendet werden. Die Untersuchung wurde mit Hilfe von Fragebögen an ungefähr 700 Spielerinnen und Spielern und 70 Trainerinnen und Trainern der deutschen Bundesligen durchgeführt. Die Rücklaufquoten betrugen 29 Prozent bzw. 50 Prozent. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass Trainer und Spieler Kenntnisse über psychische Faktoren der Leistung im Basketball hatten, dass die Einschätzung ihrer Bedeutung aber unterschiedlich war. Die Trainer sahen stärker den großen Einfluss der psychischen Faktoren auf die Leistung. Kenntnisse über psychologische Trainingsmethoden nahmen mit dem Lizenzniveau ab und waren bei Spielern nur selten vorhanden, wobei die naiven Techniken überwogen und wissenschaftliche Verfahren kaum genannt wurden. Erfahrungen mit psychologischen Trainingsmethoden hatten nur wenige Spieler gemacht. Auch bei der Wettkampfvorbereitung waren die psychologischen Anteile nur sehr gering. Bei der Lösung von Problemen innerhalb der Mannschaft wendeten die Spieler praktisch keine erprobten Konfliktbewältigungsstrategien an. Auch Selbstregulation und Emotionskontrolle waren bei Spielern und Trainern mehr oder weniger dem Zufall überlassen. Aus diesen Ergebnissen ergibt sich die Forderung, dass zukünftig in den verschiedenen Bereichen der Traineraus und -weiterbildung Kenntnisse über psychologische Trainingsverfahren vermittelt und ihre Anwendung geübt werden müssen, damit die Trainer in die Lage versetzt werden, diese notwendigen Methoden in ihre Trainingsarbeit und Wettkampfbetreuung einzubeziehen und ihren Spielern zu vermitteln.

AB - Trainingsbelastungen können zur unerwünschten Überbeanspruchung oder aber im Wechsel mit hinreichender Erholung zu einem positiven Trainingseffekt führen und so die Belastbarkeit durch Übungs- und Anpassungsprozesse fördern. Entscheidend für die Leistung ist in der Regel nicht die Belastung, sondern die subjektiv wahrgenommene Beanspruchung. Daher kann die gleiche Trainingsbelastung bei verschiedenen Athleten zu unterschiedlichen Beanspruchungenszuständen führen. Nach M. Kellmann ist Übertraining in letzter Konsequenz auf einen zeitlich überdauernden unausgewogenen Erholungs-Beanspruchungs-Zustand zurückzuführen. Den Erholungs-Beanspruchungs-Zustand zu erfassen, zu moderieren und an die Trainer bzw. die Aktiven rückzumelden stand bei der längsschnittlichen Datenerfassung in den Projekten Rudern und Radsport im Vordergrund. Durch diesen Ansatz erhielten die Trainer und Athleten mehr Informationen über die Erholungs-Beanspruchungs-Steuerung und konnten somit den Trainingsprozess genauer und individualisierter gestalten. Sowohl der Erholungs-Belastungs-Fragebogen als auch das Erholungsverlaufsprotokoll ließen sich im Trainingsalltag zur psychologischen Erholungs- und Beanspruchungssteuerung ohne Probleme einsetzen, da die Bearbeitungszeit kurz war und das Erholungsverlaufsprotokoll eine direkte Ergebnisrückmeldung erlaubte. Dies führte nach Aussage der Trainer zu einem bewussten Umgang mit Erholung und zu einer verbesserten Auswahl von Freizeitaktivitäten. Die Trainer erhielten durch die Erhebung eine systematische Rückmeldung seitens der Aktiven und konnten besser einschätzen, ob das Trainingslimit schon erreicht oder sogar überschritten worden war.

AB - In einer Einzelfallstudie wurden die Auswirkungen eines mentalen Trainingsprogramms auf den Zusammenhang zwischen Bewegungsrepräsentation und Bewegungsausführung im Schwimmsport untersucht. Auf der Basis kinemetrischer Bewegungsanalysen des Brustschwimmens und entsprechender psychologischer Anforderungsanalysen wurde ein computergestützter Messplatz entwickelt, der sowohl die Erfassung der kognitiven Repräsentationen des Bewegungsablaufs, ihre Veränderungen durch mentales Training als auch die Überpüfung der Auswirkungen auf die Bewegungsausführung ermöglichte. Mit Hilfe dieses Messplatzes wurden bei einer 17-jährigen Brustschwimmerin im Hochleistungsbereich Fehler in der Bewegungstechnik (Antriebspause zwischen Arm- und Beinbewegungen) ermittelt, die sich auch in der kognitiven Widerspiegelung des Bewegungsablaufs zeigten. Darauf aufbauend wurden Aufgabenstellungen für eine Korrektur der fehlerhaften kognitiven Repräsentationen entwickelt und in einem entsprechenden mentalen Training realisiert. Das Training führte zu einer veränderten Bewegungsrepräsentation der Sportlerin und zu einer verbesserten Bewegungsausführung. - Inhalt: (1) Die Bedeutung kognitiver Repräsentationen für die Gestaltung motorischer Lernprozesse.

AB - Ergebnisse einer Studie zur Übereinstimmung von subjektiven Feedbacktheorien von Expertentrainern und ihren Athleten in der Leichtathletik werden vorgestellt. In der Sportwissenschaft wird dem Faktor "Feedback", also der Rückmeldung, bereits seit längerem eine erhöhte Aufmerksamkeit zugesprochen. Traditionell konzipierte Feedbackstudien reduzierten häufig die Komplexität der im Feedbackprozess stattfindenden Interaktionen und beschränkten sich entweder auf den Bereich der grundlagenorientierten "Motor learning-Forschung", auf deskriptive Untersuchungen des beobachtbaren Feedbacks von Trainern oder Lehrern oder untersuchten die Effektivität des Feedbacks auf den Lernfortschritt. Hierdurch kam es häufig zu Einschränkungen des Gegenstands(vor)verständnisses. In der dargestellten Untersuchung wird versucht, der Komplexität des Feedbackprozesses dadurch gerecht zu werden, dass die Analyse der äußeren, beobachtbaren Aspekte der Handlung ergänzt wird durch die Rekonstruktion der kognitiven Prozesse, resp. impliziten Theorien bei Trainern und ihren Athleten. Gemäß dem zugrunde liegenden Gegenstandsvorverständnis ist im Sinne des epistemologischen Subjektmodells anzunehmen, dass sowohl Trainern als auch die von ihnen betreuten Athleten implizite Feedbacktheorien ausgebildet haben, die für die Entwicklung sportlicher Techniken als optimal lernfördernd angesehen werden. Es wurden in 25 Trainer-Athlet-Paarungen aus dem Hochleistungsbereich der Leichtathletik Subjektive Feedbacktheorien (SFTs) der Trainer mit den Subjektiven Theorien der von ihnen betreuten Athleten zunächst mit einer eigens dafür entwickelten Methode (re)konstruiert und anschließend miteinander verglichen. Ergänzend hierzu wurden die SFTs der Trainer mit ihrem beobachtbaren Verhalten im Trainingsalltag verglichen. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass ausgehend von den 25 Trainer-Athlet Dyaden in 15 Paarungen eine wesentliche Übereinstimmung der verbalisierten Theorien zu beobachten ist, zwischen rekonstruierter SFT der Trainer und ihrem Verhalten betrug die Übereinstimmung durchschnittlich 60 Prozent.

AB - Thema der Studie ist die Frage der Effektivität spielorientierter Sport- und Bewegungsangebote in der Förderung motorischer, alltagsmotorischer und genereller Kompetenzen bei Erwachsenen mit geistiger Behinderung. In einer quasi-experimentellen Feldstudie wurde eine Pre- und Post-Testerhebung (im Abstand von einem Jahr) durchgeführt. Teilnehmer waren 71 geistig behinderte Erwachsene im Alter von 20 bis 70 Jahren. Erhebungsinstrumente waren das "Heidelberger Kompetenzinventar", der "Bewegungskoordinationstest" und der "Draht-O-Mat". Insgesamt zeigen die Ergebnisse auf, dass durch spielorientierte Sport- und Bewegungsangebote günstige Veränderungen in verschiedenen Kompetenzbereichen bei Erwachsenen mit geistiger Behinderung erzielt werden können. Die in der Heilpädagogik weit verbreitete Annahme von Entwicklungspotenzialen Erwachsener mit geistiger Behinderung konnte eindeutig belegt werden.

AB - Der Einfluss musiktherapeutischer Maßnahmen auf Depression, Angst und Aggression wird untersucht. In einer Vorstudie wurden von einer Musiktherapeutin zur Verfügung gestellte Dokumentations- und Evaluationsunterlagen von 61 männlichen, psychisch erkrankten und stationär aufgenommenen Personen, die unmittelbar vor und unmittelbar nach der Teilnahme an musiktherapeutischen Maßnahmen zur schriftlichen Selbsteinschätzung ihrer Befindlichkeit aufgefordert worden waren, ausgewertet. In der Hauptstudie wurde ein Untersuchungsplan umgesetzt, der zum Ziel hatte, je 17 psychisch erkrankte und stationär aufgenommene Männer und Frauen im Hinblick auf die Wirkungen von drei verschiedenen Behandlungsmethoden (ausschließlich medikamentöse Behandlung; Sporttherapie bzw. Musiktherapie zusätzlich zur medikamentösen Behandlung) auf Depression, Aggression und Angst zu untersuchen. Es zeigte sich, dass die Musiktherapie der Sporttherapie und vor allem medikamentösen Therapie überlegen war. Diese Überlegenheit zeigte sich in nahezu allen untersuchten Merkmalen; in einem Zeitraum von rund fünf Wochen fanden sich signifikante Verbesserungen der Symptomatik. In der Sporttherapie zeigten sich ebenso signifikante Verbesserungen in den einzelnen psychischen Variablen, wohingegen in der nur medikamentösen Therapie lediglich signifikante Verbesserungen im Merkmal Ängstlichkeit festzustellen waren. Auch ein indirekter Vergleich der Therapiemethoden zeigte die Überlegenheit von zusätzlichen musiktherapeutischen Maßnahmen in den Merkmalen Depressivität, Zwanghaftigkeit und in einer Reduktion der Intensität der psychischen Störungen.

AB - In dieser Studie wird der Frage nachgegangen, ob sportliche Aktivität im Rahmen der betrieblichen Gesundheitsförderung die Erwartungen an die Erhaltung und Verbesserung von Gesundheit erfüllt. Die wissenschaftliche Bearbeitung dieser Fragestellung wird an einer bestehenden Stichprobe von 106 gesunden und sportlich aktiven Erwachsenen vorgenommen, die überwiegend Bildschirmarbeit verrichten. Die damit einhergehenden arbeitsbedingten Belastungen und gesundheitlichen Beanspruchungen werden diskutiert und es wird dabei aufgezeigt, welche Rolle die aktive Bewegung für eine erfolgreiche Krankheitsprävention einnimmt bzw. einnehmen könnte. Darüber hinaus interessiert die Fragestellung nach den Auswirkungen von Bewegungsprogrammen auf den in den Gesundheitswissenschaften bisher wenig betrachteten Aspekt des Commitments. In der Organisationspsychologie wird dem Commitment eine treibende Kraft für Leistung am Arbeitsplatz attestiert, quasi ein "Wirkstoff" für gute Arbeitsleistungen. Können Bewegungsprogramme die Identifikation, die Motivation und die Arbeitszufriedenheit tatsächlich verstärken? Als theoretischer Rahmen für die Beziehungen zwischen Bewegung und Gesundheit wird ein integratives Modell von Gesundheit und Krankheit verwendet, das physische und psychische Einflussgrößen von Gesundheit gleichermaßen berücksichtigt. Hier wird Gesundheit als das Ergebnis eines immer wieder aufs neue herzustellenden Gleichgewichts zwischen Belastungsfaktoren einerseits und Gesundheitsressourcen anderseits verstanden. Die Überprüfung der Fragestellungen wurde in einer quasiexperimentellen Querschnittsuntersuchung in einem Industrieunternehmen im Rahmen der betrieblichen Gesundheitsförderung durchgeführt. Das gesetzte Ziel wurde nicht vollständig erreicht, da aufgrund ungünstiger Rahmenbedingungen im Unternehmen keine quantitativen Messverfahren verwendet werden konnten, sowie das Design dahingehend abgeändert werden musste, dass keine Zweitmessung in der Kontrollgruppe durchgeführt werden konnte. In der Versuchsgruppe waren 52 Erwachsene über neun Monate in einem präventiven Bewegungsprogramm sportlich aktiv. Alle postulierten Veränderungshypothesen wurden signifikant bestätigt. Die Unterschiede vor und nach der Intervention in allgemeiner, körperlicher und psychischer Gesundheit sowie im Commitment unterschieden sich signifikant voneinander. Die Teilnehmer verbesserten zwar ihre Gesundheit und ihr Commitment zum Unternehmen, doch die eindeutigen Ergebnisse müssen kritisch in Frage gestellt werden, da die Stichprobe eine hohe Positivauswahl aufweist. Im Vergleich zur Abbrecher- und Kontrollgruppe war diese Gruppe bereits vor der Untersuchung überdurchschnittlich gesund und stark committet. Je jünger die Teilnehmer und je häufiger sie sportlich aktiv waren, desto besser war ihre Gesundheit und desto stärker war ihr Commitment. Mit zunehmendem Alter, zunehmender Dauer sowie mit zunehmender Häufigkeit sportlicher Aktivität sanken die Gesundheit und das Commitment.

After a review of the basics of rowing, the authors discuss the relevance of sport psychology in rowing using the men's 8 team as an illustration (although smaller boat types follow the same rules to a certain extent). In the psychological consulting of rowing, 3 approaches can be used: (1) coach the coach, (2) team consulting, and (3) individual consulting. Specific psychological techniques are introduced based on these concepts that have been used with the German men's 8 during preparation for the Olympic Games. In conclusion, the positive impact of the incorporation of sports psychology into team preparation is reiterated: In addition to optimizing the physical level of performance, the rowing technique, team spirit, and the boat material, sports psychology is an important element on the road to success.

AB - Die funktionale und strukturelle Verknüpfung von Wissen und Leistung im Rahmen menschlicher Handlungen wird thematisiert. Dazu wird in einem ersten Schritt auf die evolutionären Wurzeln von Wissen und Handeln eingegangen. Es wird deutlich, wie sich die Verbindung von adaptivem Verhalten und Wissensspeicherung über verschiedene Evolutionsstufen hinweg ausdifferenziert. Aufbauend auf dieser evolutionären Betrachtung wird die kognitive Architektur menschlicher Handlungen betrachtet. Hierbei geht es darum, wie Wissensrepräsentationen in die Handlungsorganisation eingebaut sind und welchen funktionalen Anteil sie am Output des Handlungssystems haben. Anschließend wird auf methodische Fragen eingegangen, die die Untersuchung von Handlungswissen betreffen. Eine experimentelle Methode zur Ermittlung der Struktur von Handlungswissen im Langzeitgedächtnis, die strukturdimensionale Analyse mentaler Repräsentationen, wird dargestellt. In einer anschließend dargestellten Studie wurde diese Methode eingesetzt, um den Zusammenhang von Objektwissen und Performanz zu analysieren. Dabei wurden Personen mit einer hohen Performanz (fünf Fahrzeugschlosser) hinsichtlich ihres Handlungswissens mit Laien (vier Sportstudenten) verglichen. In der Studie wurde deutlich, dass Performanz in einer nachvollziehbaren Beziehung zur Strukturierung des Handlungswissens steht. In einer weiteren Studie zum Zusammenhang von Bewegungswissen und Performanz im Hochleistungssport (Angriffsschlag im Volleyball bei Spielerinnen mit hoher versus niedriger Expertise) wurden die Erkenntnisse der ersten Studie in spezifischer Weise ergänzt. Es wird demonstriert, wie Wissenssysteme von Experten ermittelt werden können und wie diese Forschung zur Optimierung menschlicher Performanz beiträgt.

Die Ergebnisse zeigten einen interessanten Effekt im Vergleich der Trainergruppen. Obwohl nebenberufliche Trainer der Doppelbelastung Trainer- und Erwerbstätigkeit standhalten müssen, schienen sie die besseren Stressbewältigungsstrategien zu haben als ihre Kollegen. Hauptberuflich engagierte Trainer ließen hinsichtlich ihrer Stressbewältigung und ihrer Erholungs-Beanspruchungs-Bilanz deutliche Defizite erkennen. Die Analysen zeigten ferner, dass bei zunehmendem Alter bzw. wachsender Erfahrung mit einer günstigeren Stressbewältigung zu rechnen ist. Um fähige Trainer langfristig für die einzelnen Disziplinen zu sichern und die Betreuung von Spitzenathleten zu optimieren, sind die Erholungs-Beanspruchungs-Bilanz von Trainern und die Strategien im Umgang mit Belastungen zu beachten. Mögliche Erklärungen und Ansätze zur Verbesserung der Situation jüngerer Trainer und hauptberuflicher Trainer werden diskutiert.

(3) Für besonders wichtig wurde - neben der fachlichen Kompetenz - die Kompetenz von Trainern gehalten, ihr emotionales Verhalten angemessen zu regulieren und damit eine positive zwischenmenschliche Resonanzwirkung zu erzielen. (4) Darüber hinaus wurde der effektiven Informationsgestaltung seitens des Trainers große Bedeutung beigemessen.

Daten wurden an einer Stichprobe von 154 neben- und hauptberuflichen Trainern und Trainerinnen mit Hilfe von Fragebögen erhoben. Trainer, die sich eher als psychisch wenig beansprucht erlebten, beschrieben ihr Verhalten in den Pausen als warmherziger, aktiver und autoritärer als jene Trainer, die sich als psychisch hoch belastet einstuften. Abschließend werden mögliche Auswirkungen des Trainerverhaltens in Pausen auf die sportliche Leistung der Athleten diskutiert.

AB - Der Verlauf des emotionalen Erlebens von Handballspielern wurde über den Zeitraum einer Wettkampfsaison im Rahmen einer quasi-experimentellen Studie analysiert. Im Mittelpunkt stand dabei der spezifische Emotionsaustausch zwischen Spielern und Trainer. Zwei Variablen des emotionalen Befindens (Aufgeregtheit, Lust bzw. Unlust) wurden an vier Spielern sowie ihrem Trainer jeweils vor und nach den Wettkämpfen einer Saison erhoben. Außerdem lagen die Teamleistungsdaten dieser Saison vor. Pfadanalysen der Daten zeigten, dass durch das emotionale Erleben des Trainers die Varianz des emotionalen Erlebens der Spieler zu einem ganz erheblichen Teil aufgeklärt werden konnte. War der Trainer aufgeregt oder erlebte er den Wettkampf als lustvoll, so wiesen die Spieler gleichsinnige emotionale Erfahrungen auf. Dieser Befund wird durch die emotionale Nähe des Trainers zu den Spielern erklärt.

Dabei wird unter anderem deutlich gemacht, dass sollwertorientierte Bewegungsvorstellungen zwar nicht am Beginn des Lernprozesses, wohl aber in späterern Phasen des Bewegungslernens zu deutlichen Leistungsverbesserungen (im Vergleich zum Lernen ohne Bewegungsvorstellungsinduktion) führen. Die vorliegenden Befunde werden insgesamt dahingehend interpretiert, dass Vorstellungsprozesse bei entsprechendem Vortraining im Sinne eines ideomotorischen Bewegungsvollzugs bzw. bei sollwertorientierter Fokussierung der Aufmerksamkeit auf relevante Teilaspekte des Bewegungsablaufes den Prozess der Aneignung sportlicher Bewegungen deutlich verbessern können.

AB - Dynamische Prozesse im Rahmen der zentralnervösen Aktivierung beim ideomotorischen Training werden untersucht. Daten wurden in zwei Versuchsserien an Stichproben von insgesamt 17 studentischen Versuchspersonen erhoben. Die Ausführung des ideomotorischen Trainings führte zu charakteristischen Veränderungen der mittleren Frequenz im Alpha-Bereich des Elektroenzephalogramms, von Herzschlagfrequenz, Atemzugdauer und Hautleitwert. Der Verlauf dieser Parameter erwies sich als abhängig von der Dauer und der zeitlichen Folge des Trainings. Insgesamt werden die Befunde als Beleg dafür gewertet, dass während der Ausführung des Trainings in einzelnen Teilsystemen differenzierte Aktivierungpsrozesse ablaufen. Es scheint notwendig, ein sportartspezifisch konkret verwendetes Paradigma zum Einsatz des Trainings aus psychophysiologischer Sicht auf einen günstigen Verlauf der Aktivierungsparameter zu prüfen, um den Erfolg des Einsatzes des Trainings im gewünschten Umfang zu gewährleisten.

AB - In Zusammenarbeit mit dem Landessportbund Berlin wurden insgesamt 343 Übungsleiter aus den Bereichen des Gesundheits- und Freizeitsports im Rahmen einer Fragebogenuntersuchung darum gebeten, die Wirksamkeit verschiedener Strategien zur Motivation von Kursteilnehmern einzuschätzen. Faktorenanalytische Untersuchungen führten zur Identifizierung zweier Motivierungsstile, die in Anlehnung an E. L. Deci und R. M. Ryan's Selbst-Determinationstheorie als externaler Motivierungsstil (etwa "Führen von Anwesenheitslisten") bzw. internaler Motivierungsstil (etwa "Freude an Bewegung vermitteln") bezeichnet wurden. Überprüft wurde ferner, wie sich diese beiden Motivierungsstile den untersuchten Übungsleitern zuordnen lassen. Eine entsprechende Clusteranalyse ergab zwei Typen: (1) den Typus des internal fokussierenden Übungsleiters, der es für notwendig hält, vornehmlich an den in der Person selbst liegenden Bedingungen der Teilnahmemotivation anzusetzen; und (2) den Typus des dual fokussierenden Übungsleiters, der sowohl die internalen als auch die externalen Motivierungsstrategien als wirkungsvoll einschätzt. In einer abschließenden Analyse wurde festgestellt, dass Übungsleiter vom Typ "internal fokussierend" eher einen Teilnehmerzuwachs in ihren Kursen zu verzeichnen hatten als solche vom Typ "dual fokussierend". Insgesamt werfen die Ergebnisse die Frage auf, ob das Phänomen des Dropouts im Freizeit- und Gesundheitssport vielmehr als bislang angenommen auch als Ergebnis fehlerhafter Motivierungsversuche angesehen werden muss.

AB - Es wird eine tabellarisch unterstützte Literaturübersicht über die Auswirkungen von Sport bei gesunden und psychisch erkrankten Personen gegeben. In einer Reihe von Studien an Gesunden konnte ein günstiger Einfluss von Ausdauertraining auf psychische Parameter wie Ängstlichkeit, Depressivität, Selbstbewusstsein, Konzentrationsfähigkeit und Stressbewältigung festgestellt werden. Dagegen befassen sich deutlich weniger Studien mit den Effekten von Ausdauertraining bei psychischen Erkrankungen. Die bisherigen Daten sprechen dafür, dass Sport einen positiven Einfluss bei leichten bis mittelschweren Depressionen und bei Angststörungen hat. Der therapeutische Effekt korrelierte in den meisten Studien nicht mit Veränderungen der kardiopulmonalen Fitness, so daß andere psychologische und neurobiologische Wirkmechanismen diskutiert werden müssen. Es werden Möglichkeiten aufgezeigt, wie Sport in die Behandlung psychischer Erkrankungen integriert und weiter evaluiert werden kann.

AB - Anhand ausgewählter Befunde aus der Potsdamer Lehrerstudie, in der nahezu 8000 Lehrer zu ihrer Belastung und psychischen Gesundheit befragt wurden, wird deutlich gemacht, dass sich ein bedenkliches Bild der Beanspruchungssituation im Lehrerberuf erkennen lässt. Es zeigte sich, dass höhere gesundheitliche Risiken als in anderen Berufen vorliegen, wobei sich für die Lehrerinnen kritischere Verhältnisse als für ihre männlichen Kollegen abzeichneten. Dabei ließen sich kaum Abhängigkeiten von der Schulform und den unterrichteten Fächern auffinden. Am ehesten wurden fächerabhängige Differenzierungen im Gymnasium festgestellt. Sie weisen insbesondere auf eine problematische Beanspruchungssituation der Sportlehrerinnen hin. Bezogen auf vier Handlungsfelder (Rahmen- und Arbeitsbedingungen des Berufs, Rekrutierung und Vorbereitung des Lehrernachwuchses, Entwicklungsbemühungen der Lehrer) werden Schlussfolgerungen zur Veränderung des vorgefundenen Zustandsbildes abgeleitet.

Die Trainingssteuerung im Hochleistungssport unterscheidet sich von jener im Leistungssport und Fitnesssport vor allem durch (1) die aus sozialer und psychologischer Sicht intensive Trainer-Athlet-Beziehung, (2) exakte Terminbezogenheit der Topformentwicklung zum Wettkampfhöhepunkt hin und extreme Grenzwertigkeit der Trainingsbelastung am Limit der individuellen Adaptationskapazität, (3) erhöhte Bedeutung der Wettkampfsteuerung und Wettkampfdiagnostik, (3) stressbegleitete Präsentation unter außergewöhnlichen Wettkampfbedingungen. Nur bei einer optimalen Ausprägung aller vier Bedingungsfaktoren können Weltspitzenleistungen entstehen. Bleiben individuelle Topleistungen zum Wettkampfhöhepunkt aus, dann sind die Ursachen im Allgemeinen in der mangelhaften Ausgestaltung eines oder mehrerer dieser Bedingungsfaktoren zu suchen.

Bei insgesamt 863 Frauen und Männern wurde das habituelle körperliche Gesundheitsniveau bestimmt und zu folgenden Variablen in Beziehung gesetzt: Alter, Geschlecht, seelische Gesundheit (Fähigkeit zur Bewältigung externer und interner Anforderungen), Kohärenzsinn, internale Kontrollüberzeugung bezüglich der Gesundheit, Sporttreiben bei Belastung, depressives Bewältigungsverhalten, gesunde Ernährung, intensives Sporttreiben, gutes Schlafen sowie soziale Unterstützung. Eine salutogenetische Auswertungsstrategie (Vergleich Hochgesunder mit den restlichen Personen) führte zu teilweise anderen Ergebnissen als eine pathogenetische Strategie (Vergleich Mindergesunder mit den restlichen Personen). Verantwortlich hierfür sind nichtlineare Regressionen, die künftig stärker beachtet werden sollten. Die dritte, genuin gesundheitspsychologische Strategie (Korrelation des Gesundheitsniveaus mit potentiellen GRV über alle Personen) erwies sich als besonders vorteilhaft. Die Ergebnisse werden unter methodischen und inhaltlichen Gesichtspunkten diskutiert.

Die inhaltsanalytische Auswertung der Interviews erbrachte Hinweise darauf, dass der Modus des Vorstellens und die Ausgestaltung der vorgestellten Szene von individuellen und situativen Bedingungen abhingen. Die Außenperspektive wurde weitaus häufiger gewählt als die Innenperspektive. Insgesamt werden die Befunde als Beleg dafür gewertet, dass es keine optimale Vorstellung gibt, die damit allgemeingültig als Modell für Vorstellungstrainingsprozesse gelten könnte.

Unabhängig von den sportartspezifischen Anforderungen ließen sich die folgenden Aussagen ableiten: (1) Die mentale Reproduktion des eigenen Bewegungsablaufs muss im Detail bildhaft-anschaulich sein. (2) Im mentalen Ablauf muss eine flüssige Verbindung der einzelnen Bewegungsphasen gelingen und jedes Fixieren auf Einzelmerkmale des Ablaufs vermieden werden. (3) In die mentale Repäsentation sollten nach den Analysen stark gefühlsgeprägte Elemente über den Bewegungsablauf mit eingehen, die bildhaft-anschaulich verwoben sind. (4) Gute mentale Repäsentationen gingen mit deutlichen Verbesserungen der sportlichen Leistungen einher.

Als Rahmentheorie wurde auf das wissensdiagnostische Modell von J. C. Fallmagne und J. P. Doignon zurückgegriffen. Auf der Grundlage psychologischer und biomechanischer Anforderungsanalysen des Brustschwimmens wurden Aufgaben konstruiert, zu deren Lösung das Wissen über bewegungsstrukturelle Merkmale dieses Schwimmstils erforderlich ist. Das Verfahren wurde in einer quasi-experimentellen Studie mit 31 Sportstudierenden überprüft. 17 Studierende führten ein mentales Trainingsprogramm zum Brustschwimmen durch, 14 dienten als Kontrollgruppe ohne spezifische Intervention. Das gewählte wissensdiagnostische Vorgehen erwies sich als geeignet, Veränderungen der Bewegungsausführung und der internen Bewegungsrepräsentation abzubilden. Es ergaben sich unterschiedliche Effekte für die beiden Gruppen.

Hierbei werden alle 229 Trainerwechsel berücksichtigt, die in der Fußball-Bundesliga von der Saison 1963/64 bis 1994/95 während einer laufenden Saison durchgeführt wurden. Die vor und nach dem Wechsel erzielten Leistungen wurden für die Auswertung herangezogen und zur Kontrolle möglicher Störgrößen mit den Leistungen vergleichbarer Mannschaften in Beziehung gesetzt. Insgesamt zeigte sich, dass sich die Leistungsentwicklung von Fußball-Mannschaften, die während der Saison ihren Trainer wechselten, nach diesem Ereignis weder kurz- noch längerfristig (bis zum Ende der betreffenden Saison) von der Leistungsentwicklung der Mannschaften unterschied, die sich zum entsprechenden Zeitpunkt in einer den Trainerwechsel-Mannschaften vergleichbaren Ausgangslage befanden und den Trainer nicht wechselten.

AB - Unter Bezugnahme auf die Theorie der dualen (implizit versus expizit) Informationsverarbeitung von Janssen wird über zwei Planexperimente zur Rolle des mentalen Trainings im sportmotorischen Lernen berichtet. Für zwei motorische Aufgaben (submaximale Hockstrecksprünge, Basketballpositionswürfe) wurden folgende Bedingungen realisiert: (1) Trainingsmethode (kontingentes mentales Training versus kontingente progressive Muskelentspannung versus massiertes praktisches Üben), (2) Lernbedingung (normale Ausführung versus mit Dunkelbrille) sowie (3) Messwiederholung (20 Lerndurchgänge, 5 unmittelbare Reproduktionen, 5 verzögerte Reproduktionen). Unter den sechs unabhängigen Bedingungen pro Aufgabe arbeiteten jeweils 5 Probanden. Bei beiden motorischen Aufgaben waren alle Haupteffekte signifikant. Beide Lernhilfen (mentales Training, progressive Muskelentspannung) waren beim Positionswurf (Trefferquote) effektiv, beim submaximalen Hockstrecksprung (Sollwertabweichungen) dagegen nur die progressive Muskelentspannung. Die Ergebnisse werden als Beleg für die Dualitätstheorie mit verhaltenstheoretischer Ergänzung interpretiert, jedoch als unvereinbar mit anderen Ansätzen (Kognitionstheorien, generalisierte motorische Programme).

AB - Ausgangspunkt ist die Frage, wie Menschen mit geistiger Behinderung Sportangebote nutzen und wie sie auf sportliche Aktivität reagieren. Mit dem Konzept der Kontrollierten Praxis wird eine Forschungsstrategie vorgestellt, die Effekte praktischen Handelns so gut wie möglich und so fundiert wie nötig abbilden soll. Auf der Grundlage theoretischer Überlegungen zum Sport von Menschen mit geistiger Behinderung wird das Konzept der Kontrollierten Praxis vorgestellt und anhand von zwei freizeitsportlich ausgerichteten Programmen im Schwimmen und Tanzen mit geistig behinderten Erwachsenen verdeutlicht.

Auf dem Hintergrund eines Modells der funktionalen Regulation und nach einer Abgrenzung gegenüber dem Modell der Handlungs- und Lageorientierung werden ausgewählte eigene Befunde aus einer Reihe von experimentellen Studien vorgestellt, in denen Reproduktionsleistungen sowohl unter Zeitdruck als auch ohne Zeitdruck gemessen wurden. In diesem Zusammenhang wird auch auf die praktisch relevante Frage eingegangen, ob Wettkampfstress oder sonstige Belastungen die Regulationsprozesse stören können und ob diesen Störungen durch stabilisierende psychoregulative Trainingsmethoden (mentales Training) entgegengewirkt werden kann.

Studie I betrifft die kardiopulmonale Fitness von 38 Patienten mit Panikstörung im Vergleich zu 12 gesunden Kontrollpersonen. In Studie II wurde die Empfindlichkeit zentraler serotonerger Rezeptoren bei 40 Patienten mit Panikstörung im Vergleich zu 12 gesunden Kontrollpersonen analysiert. In Studie III wurde ein speziell konzipiertes sporttherapeutisches Programm zur Therapie von Panikstörung und Agoraphobie im Vergleich zu einer Behandlung mit Clomipramin versus Placebo bei insgesamt 46 Patienten evaluiert. Studie IV ist eine vergleichende Untersuchung der Reaktion auf serotonerge Testsubstanzen bei 12 Marathonläufern und 12 Kontrollpersonen. Die Befunde weisen darauf, dass bereits ein alleiniges Ausdauertraining zu einer signifikanten Besserung der Angstsymptomatik führt. Der therapeutische Nutzen von Bewegung und Sport für andere psychische Störungen wird ergänzend im Überblick dargestellt, und die positiven Wirkmechanismen von körperlicher Aktivität werden diskutiert.

Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass vor allem die Art und Weise, wie den Betroffenen vom Trainer der Verlust der Mannschaftszugehörigkeit mitgeteilt wurde ("unfaire" Kurzinformation versus ausführliches Gespräch), das Selbstkonzept und die spätere Selbstwertentwicklung ganz wesentlich beeinflusste. In Abhängigkeit davon veränderte sich im Krisenverlauf auch das Sozial- und Bewältigungsverhalten. Auf die Verantwortung der Trainer und Betreuer wird hingewiesen.

AB - Erfahrungen mit der psychomotorischen Förderung geistig behinderter Kinder werden beschrieben. Dabei wird ein methodisches Konzept zur Diskussion gestellt, das innerhalb der Geistigbehindertenpädagogik weitgehend umstritten ist: Es geht von einer Fähigkeit geistig behinderter Kinder aus, Lernprozesse selbsttätig und mit einem hohen Maß an Leistungsmotivation und Kreativität zu realisieren. Entsprechend ist die "offene" Bewegungserziehung durch ein nicht-direktives Lehrerverhalten und den bewussten Verzicht auf ein geplantes und gesteuertes Arrangement von Lern- und Übungssituationen charakterisiert. Im Rahmen einer heilpaedogogisch begründeten psychomotorischen Erziehung wird diesem nicht-direktiven Vorgehen eine ebenso große Bedeutung zugemessen wie dem geplanten Unterricht.

Im Ausblick auf die Entwicklungstendenzen im vereinsgetragenen Sport wird auf die Probleme einer zunehmenden Sachorientierung der Mitglieder für die Vereine hingewiesen, die begleitet ist von einer abnehmenden Bindungsbereitschaft und daraus resultierend einer wachsenden Fluktuation. Gleichzeitig wird eine weitere Verbreitung des Sports in bislang weniger beteiligte Bevölkerungsgruppen erwartet.

Der Lehrweg der Schwimmausbildung entsprach allgemeinen Erfahrungen der Wassergewöhnung: Nach vorbereitenden Übungen im flachen Wasser wurde die Brustschwimmtechnik in 180 cm tiefem Wasser geübt. Da die Konzentrationsfähigkeit der Kinder schnell nachließ, wurden alle Lernprozesse individuell begonnen und dann in spielerischen Gruppenübungen fortgesetzt.

Beginnend mit der Einstellung der Trainer, wurde die Leistungsentwicklung der Teams und der Spieler über eine halbe Saison hinweg analysiert. Die Stichprobe umfasst 38 Trainer; als Erfolgsmaße wurden die erreichte Punktzahl sowie die Anzahl der Siege und Niederlagen analysiert. Individuelle Leistungsbeurteilungen der Spieler wurden der Sportpresse entnommen und beschreiben 844 Athleten. Auf Teamebene konnten keine signifikanten Effekte gefunden werden. Allerdings zeigen sich signifikante Effekte verschiedener transformationaler Führungsstile auf die individuelle Leistung und deren Entwicklung. Es wurde deutlich, dass durch das Paradigma der Transformationalen Führung lediglich auf die individuelle Leistung der Geführten Einfluss genommen werden kann. Die transformationalen Führungsstile "Geistige Anregung", "Vorbild sein" und "Individuelle Unterstützung" hatten signifikante Effekte auf die sportliche Leistung der Spieler.

AB - Einsatzmöglichkeiten der prozessorientierten energetischen Psychologie (PEP) im Sportcoaching werden beschrieben. Zunächst wird auf die gestiegene Bedeutung mentalen Trainings im Hochleistungssport eingegangen. Gerade bei schweren Unfällen und Stürzen besteht oft ein schneller Handlungsbedarf, damit der Sportler ohne mentale Hindernisse seinem Sport wieder nachgehen kann. Die beeinträchtigende Wirkung von psychischem Druck auf die sportliche Leistung wird veranschaulicht. Es kann zu einer zentralen Störung der natürlichen rhythmischen Muskelaktivierung kommen, nämlich zu einer gleichzeitigen Kontraktion von agonistischen und antagonistischen Muskeln. Als Idealzustand im Sport wird der Flow-Zustand genannt. Als Interventionstechniken für das Sportcoaching werden hypnotherapeutische Verfahren, EMDR, Akupunktur und PEP vorgeschlagen. In Bezug auf die PEP werden die so genannten Big-Five-Erfolgsblockaden sowie die fünf sportspezifischen Siegerhandicaps beschrieben. Anschließend wird auf besondere Anforderungen bei Meisterschaften sowie typische dysfunktionale Einstellungen von Sportlern eingegangen. Es folgt ein Fallbeispiel aus dem Sportcoachingbereich. Im Resümee wird festgestellt, dass PEP im Hochleistungssport für viele Indikationen, sehr vielfältig und in vielen Kombinationsmöglichkeiten verwendet werden kann. Vorteile sind die schnelle Erlernbarkeit, das rasch erlebte Gefühl von Selbstwirksamkeit und die selbstständige Durchführbarkeit.

Vielmehr sollen Konflikte als Chance zur Unterstützung einer erfolgreichen Trainerarbeit verstanden werden, die zusätzliches Verständnis, Vertrauen und Eigenverantwortung fördern. Es wird gezeigt, dass dann, wenn die positiven Potenziale eines Konflikts aktiv genutzt werden, wichtige Entscheidungen und Veränderungen in Gang gesetzt werden, die helfen, sportliche Ziele zu erreichen - für die Trainer selbst und für die von ihnen betreuten Sportler und Mannschaften.

AB - Ein Überblick über theoretische Grundlagen, empirische Befunde und anwendungsbezogene Implikationen sportpsychologischer Analysen zur Bedeutung von Stress und Stressbewältigung für die sportliche Leistung und das psychische bzw. körperliche Wohlbefinden der Athleten wird gegeben. Ausgehend von Modellvorstellungen zu Aktivierung, Emotion und sportlicher Leistung werden situationsbezogene, reaktionsbezogene und transaktionale Stresskonzeptionen erläutert. Es wird deutlich gemacht, dass in der sportpsychologischen Stressforschung die theoretische Orientierung am "Appraisal"-Konzept von R. S. Lazarus dominiert, die verbunden mit ihren Annahmen zur Annäherung und Vermeidung auf kognitiver und behavioraler Ebene ein Rahmenmodell für die Prozessanalyse von Stress und Stressbewältigung im Sport darstellt. Weiterhin wird auf folgende Aspekte eingegangen: (1) Stressoren im Sport für unterschiedliche Personengruppen (Sportler, Schiedsrichter, Trainer, Fans), (2) Stressreaktionen (wahrgenommener Stress, emotionale Beeinträchtigung, Beanspruchung und Erholung, störende Gedanken), (3) Stressauswirkungen (Sportverletzungen, Burnout), (4) Diagnostik von Stressbewältigung (sportbezogene Adaptationen etablierter Verfahren der Stressforschung, sportartübergreifende Verfahren, spezifische Verfahren für bestimmte Sportarten oder einzelne Stressoren).

AB - Auf dem Hintergrund eigener Sporterfahrungen und unter besonderer Berücksichtigung der eigenen Berufstätigkeit als Psychotherapeut wird die Integration von Ausdauersport in ambulante Psychotherapien thematisiertt. Ausgangspunkt der Überlegungen ist die Vorstellung von Körper und Psyche als Ganzheit: Psychische Störungen haben Auswirkungen auf das körperliche Wohlbefinden; über die Psyche können körperliche Prozesse gesteuert werden. Auf der anderen Seite können durch Bewegung psychische Empfindungen ausgelöst werden, wie in der Bewegungstherapie. Neben der Beschreibung der Methodik der Integration von Ausdauersport in die ambulante Psychotherapie von Patienten mit Angststörungen, Depressionen oder Übergewicht werden ein Fallbeispiel und Ergebnisse einer Untersuchung zum Einfluss von Ausdauersport in der ambulanten Psychotherapie vorgestellt. In einer Befragung von insgesamt 129 Patienten aus zwei Praxen, von denen eine begleitend Ausdauersport anbot, wurde ermittelt, wie Patienten ihren Therapieerfolg einschätzen. Die Ergebnisse belegen einen positiven Zusammenhang zwischen der Einschätzung des Therapieerfolgs und sportlichen Programmen.

AB - Wettkampfangst und ihre Auswirkungen auf die Leistung im Sport sind seit langem Gegenstand der Forschung. Im Bereich des Kampfsports, und dabei insbesondere in Vollkontaktsportarten jenseits der etablierten olympischen Disziplinen, gibt es noch wenige Untersuchungen über die Auswirkungen von Wettkampfangst. Ebenso mangelt es bislang an Arbeiten, die die Effekte sportpsychologischer Interventionen auf Wettkämpfer in Turnieren untersuchen. Dabei erscheint es gerade für diese Zielgruppe von - im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes - Einzelkämpfern angebracht, ihnen Werkzeuge zur Regulierung von Wettkampfangst vor und während eines Turniers an die Hand zu geben. Nachdem im Rahmen einer Vorstudie gezeigt werden konnte, dass akute Wettkampfangst im Verlauf einer Landesmeisterschaft im Amateur Muay Thai mit schlechterer Leistung im ersten Kampf des Turniers zusammenhing, wurde ein speziell für die Zielgruppe der Muay Thai-Boxer entwickelter Entspannungs-Mentaltrainings-Workshop erarbeitet. Der Workshop erstreckte sich über die letzten 8 Wochen vor der Landesmeisterschaft Baden-Württemberg 2009 und wurde in 4 Muay Thai-Clubs durchgeführt. Die Effektivität dieses Workshops wurde ermittelt, indem die Wettkampfangst sowie verschiedene Leistungsmaße der 33 Workshopteilnehmer an dem Turnier mit Wettkämpfern einer ebenfalls aus 33 Wettkämpfern bestehenden Kontrollgruppe verglichen wurden. Es zeigte sich, dass die Kämpfer aus der Workshop-Bedingung mit weniger Angst in den Turniertag gingen. Dieser Unterschied war jedoch vor dem Wettkampf nicht mehr nachweisbar. Während die Athleten der Workshop-Gruppe zwar nicht signifikant häufiger ihre Wettkämpfe gewannen, so waren sie doch besser in der Lage, ihre Trainingsleistung im Kampf abzurufen als die Kämpfer der Kontrollgruppe. Die Ergebnisse werden abschließend in Bezug auf praktische Relevanz und Einordnung zur gegenwärtigen Forschung diskutiert.

AB - Im Jahre 1990 veröffentlichten Gabler, Janssen und Nitsch die erste sportartübergreifende deutsche Studie zum Thema Einsatz und Bedarf sportpsychologischer Interventionen. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wird zum einen ein Vergleich dieser Studie mit einer ähnlichen Erhebung in Nordbayern 15 Jahre später vorgenommen, um einen Hinweis auf die bisherige Entwicklung in der Anwendung der Sportpsychologie in der Praxis zu bekommen. Weiterhin werden die Ergebnisse einer Befragung zu Bestand und Bedarf sportpsychologischer Maßnahmen bei Bundeskaderathleten und Trainern verschiedener Sportarten des Bundesleistungszentrums Fürth, Nordbayern (115 Athleten, 18 Trainer) berichtet. Beide Studien zeigen, dass sportpsychologische Maßnahmen von Trainingsverantwortlichen immer noch zu spärlich eingesetzt werden. Dies wird meist durch Personal- und Geldmangel begründet. Außerdem verfügen insbesondere Athleten über mangelnde fachspezifische Kenntnisse. Darüber hinaus deuten die Ergebnisse jedoch auf ein großes Interesse an sportpsychologischen Maßnahmen sowie deren künftigem Einsatz in Training und Wettkampf hin.

AB - Der Zusammenhang zwischen sportlicher Aktivität und Selbst wird aus der Perspektive der kognitionspsychologisch orientierten Forschung betrachtet. Einleitend wird die Notwendigkeit eines Perspektivenwechsels durch die empirische Befundlage zu zwei zentralen sportwissenschaftlichen Forschungsfragen begründet, nämlich der Beziehung zwischen tatsächlicher und wahrgenommener physischer Fitness sowie der Beziehung zwischen sportlicher Aktivität und Selbst. Anschließend wird das Selbst als kontext- und strukturabhängige mentale Repräsentation selbstbezogener Informationen konzipiert. Exemplarisch für die konitionspsychologische Sicht wird das Semantisch-Prozedurale-Interface-Modell von B. Hannover und Mitarbeitern in Auszügen vorgestellt. Vor diesem Hintergrund wird ein Überblick zur Wirkung der kognitiven Strukturfaktoren der Zentralität, Referenz und Stabilität auf den Zusammenhang von sportlicher Aktivität und Selbst gegeben. Dabei wird deutlich gemacht, dass die vorliegenden Befunde eher die Komplexität des Gegenstandes abbilden als konsistente oder ausreichend evidente Aussagen zu ermöglichen. Für die Zukunft wird eine Erweiterung der kognitionspsychologischen Perspektive um die Aspekte der motivationalen Gebundenheit, der reziproken Wirkungen von Selbst und Informationsverarbeitung sowie bewusster selbstregulativer Prozesse diskutiert.

AB - Allgemeine Grundlagen und Fragen der praktischen Anwendung der Psychoregulation im Sport werden erörtert. Als wesentliche theoretische Ansätze einer auf einem tätigkeitsorientierten Handlungskonzept beruhenden Psychoregulation werden der Zusammenhang zwischen Aktivierung und Leistung, Flusserleben (Flow), mentale Fitness, Rückkopplung als Funktionsprinzip des Organismus sowie die Bedeutung der Selbstregulation diskutiert. Bedingungen, Merkmale Funktionen und psychische Leistungsvoraussetzungen für eine effiziente Psychoregulation werden aus entsprechenden empirischen Forschungsergebnissen abgeleitet. Folgende Ziele und Anforderungen der Psychoregulation im Sport werden herausgearbeitet: (1) positive Einstellungen zu Belastungsanforderungen ausprägen, (2) Selbstvertrauen in die eigene Leistungsfähigkeit entwickeln, (3) optimalen Zustand psychischer Leistungsbereitschaft ausprägen, (4) Problemsituationen im Training und Wettkampf erfolgreich bewältigen, (5) kognitive Prozesse der Bewegungsregulation optimieren, (6) Antriebsprozesse beim Bewältigen hoher sportlicher Anforderungen aktivieren, (7) psychische Regenerationsprozesse nach Belastungen bzw. die Verarbeitung psychischer Traumata nach Verletzungen beschleunigen. Grundsätze der Anwendung psychoregulativer Verfahren im Sport sowie Methoden und Gestaltungsformen zur Ausprägung leistungsfördernder Regulationsprozesse werden angeführt. Dabei wird auf die Optimierung der Zustands- und Emotionsregulation durch Relaxationstechniken (etwa Entspannungsatmung, Autogenes Training, Progressive Muskelrelaxation, Emotionsruhebilder, Meditation, Hypnose, psychomuskuläres Training, Biofeedback) bzw. durch Methoden zur Verbesserung der Antriebsregulation (etwa Aktivierungstechniken, Aktivierungsatmung, Selbstmotivierungsformen, Visualisierung, Zielsetzungstraining), auf Ansätze zur Verbesserung kognitiver Prozesse der Bewegungsregulation (etwa mentales Training, Feldenkraismethode, Wahrnehmung- und Konzentrationstraining) sowie auf mentale Techniken zur Verbesserung der Selbstregulationskompetenz im Wettkampf (etwa systematische Desensibilisierung, Stressimpfungstraining, Gedankenstopp) eingegangen. Das Vorgehen wird anhand von Fallbeispielen aus der Praxis der Psychoregulation veranschaulicht.

AB - Explores the mental representations of soccer players when presented with written material describing soccer game situations in 3 experimental studies. Experiment 1 (18 soccer players) assessed off-line processing by having players of different levels generate written soccer scripts. The results predominantly showed that players of lower expertise were less "other-oriented" and included more emotional elements in their mental representations. Experiments 2a and 2b (43 soccer players; 13 National League, 14 First Division, 16 Fifth Division) further explored these differences. Using an online measure, a reading-time paradigm, the authors showed that First Division players' mental representations more easily included "others" and less readily included emotions, as opposed to both National League and Fifth Division players. Although Fifth Division and National League were similar, different cognitive processes may underlie the construction of the players' mental representations.

Insgesamt zeigen die Ergebnisse, dass unter der Perspektive einer "Evidenced Based Medicine" lediglich eine moderate bis schwache Evidenz für die sportliche Betätigung körperlich oder psychisch erkrankter Personen spricht. Theoretische und methodische Begründungen für dieses zurückhaltende Urteil werden diskutiert.

Die Bindungsmuster wurden durch ein Geschichtenergänzungsverfahren (N=47) rekonstruiert. In der zweiten Studie (N=263) kamen Fragebögen zum Einsatz. Die Übereinstimmung zwischen beiden Bindungsmustern ist im Vergleich zu thematisch verwandten Untersuchungen mit Vorschul- und Primarschulpädagogen ungewöhnlich stark. Es wird damit gezeigt, dass bindungstypische Regulationsprozesse auch in hoch instruktions- und aufgabenorientierten Settings eine wichtige Rolle spielen. Als Einflussgrößen werden in Verbindung mit den Daten der zweiten Studie die wahrgenommene Fürsorglichkeit und Kompetenz der Lehrkräfte sowie Besonderheiten des Handlungsfeldes Leistungssport diskutiert.

AB - Sport und körperlicher Aktivität werden aufgrund ihres gesundheitlichen Nutzens protektive Wirkungen in Bezug auf gesundheitliche Folgen von Stress zugeschrieben. Die stresspuffernde Wirkung konnte bisher jedoch nicht eindeutig nachgewiesen werden - die Befunde sind inkonsistent. Der vorliegende Beitrag überprüft Puffereffekte von Sport und körperlicher Aktivität bei verschiedenen Arten von physischen und psychischen Beschwerden. Hierzu wurden in einer Studie 453 Personen zu chronischem Stress (Perceived Stress Scale), gesundheitlichen Beschwerden (Gießener Beschwerdebogen) sowie ihrem subjektiven Aktivitätsverhalten (Energieverbrauch durch sportliche Aktivitäten zum Beispiel Fußball, Joggen; Energieverbrauch durch körperliche Aktivität - tägliche Geh- und Radstrecke) befragt. Bei nahezu allen Beschwerdearten zeigt sich eine Pufferwirkung von Sport, nicht jedoch von körperlicher Aktivität. Sport wirkt bei Personen, die viel Stress erleben, beschwerdereduzierend. Eine differenzierte Betrachtung des Aktivitätsverhaltens, des Stresserlebens sowie der Art der Beschwerden könnte zu detaillierteren Befunden beitragen.

Diese Fragen werden in der vorliegenden (sport-)psychologischen Arbeit behandelt. Orientiert am aktuellen Forschungsstand wird ein Instrument zur psychologischen Diagnostik mentaler Fitness abgeleitet und empirisch exploriert. Dabei werden nicht nur zentrale Persönlichkeitsaspekte von Athleten, sondern auch deren soziale Beziehungen im sportlichen und außersportlichen Kontext mit einbezogen. Implikationen dieses innovativen Vorgehens für einen Einsatz in der sportpsychologischen Praxis werden diskutiert.

AB - Elfmeterforschung kann dazu dienen, grundlagenwissenschaftliche Erkenntnisse und Theorien in einem realitätsnäheren Umfeld zu überprüfen oder anwendungsorientierte Erkenntnisse zu gewinnen. Bei vielen Studienergebnissen stellt sich die Frage, inwieweit diese Erkenntnisse auch bei Elfmeterschießen bei Europa- und Weltmeisterschaften von Relevanz sind. Sechs mögliche Einflussfaktoren (Trikotfarbe Rot, Schussbein, Erfahrung, Nationalität, Schussreihenfolge, Schussrichtung) werden anhand einer retrospektiven Analyse aller vergangener Elfmeterschießen bei WM- und EM-Turnieren von 1982 bis 2012 überprüft. Die Ergebnisse deuten darauf hin, dass drei Faktoren - Nationalität, Schussreihenfolge und Schussrichtung - einen tatsächlichen Einfluss auf die Erfolgswahrscheinlichkeit bei Elfmeterschießen der beiden größten Fußballturniere haben. Die anwendungsbezogene Relevanz von experimentell gewonnenen Ergebnissen in Elfmetersituationen wird abschließend kritisch diskutiert.

AB - Im vorliegenden Beitrag wurde der Siebenmeterwurf (7M) im Spitzenhandball aus unterschiedlichen, sich ergänzenden Perspektiven untersucht: Phänomenologisch als standardisierte 1:1-Situation mit Spiel entscheidendem Charakter und theoriebasiert als (intentionale) Bewegungshandlung interagierender Akteure. Auf der Basis einer Analyse der Spielberichtsbögen (47 Teilnehmer) und der zugehörigen Siebenmeterwürfe (7M, 419 Würfe) der Handball-Europameisterschaft der Männer 2010 in Österreich wurde der Zusammenhang von personalen Faktoren der Werfer, zum Beispiel Händigkeit und Länderspielerfahrung, sowie situativen Faktoren, zum Beispiel Spielposition, Anzahl zuvor geworfener 7M und der Trefferquote untersucht. In einem zweiten Schritt wurden darauf aufbauend Aktionsmuster von Werfern und Torhütern mittels Inhaltsanalyse von 166 7M-Videos aus 30 Spielen desselben Turniers extrahiert. Die empirisch gewonnenen Aktionsmuster der Torhüter und Werfer aus den beiden Studien wurden Torhütern bzw. Torhütertrainern aus dem nationalen Spitzenhandball vorgelegt und in Bezug auf ihre Praxisrelevanz kommunikativ validiert.

AB - Es wurde wiederholt darauf hingewiesen, dass der Anlaufwinkel eines Elfmeterschützen das Abwehrverhalten eines Torhüters beeinflussen könnte. Eine experimentelle Überprüfung des Einflusses des Anlaufwinkels auf die Vorhersage der Schussrichtung aus Torhütersicht liegt allerdings noch nicht vor. In einem videobasierten Experiment wurde der Anlaufwinkel links- und rechtsfüßiger Schützen auf sechs Stufen variiert (0° bis 50°) und je 20 Torhüter, Feldspieler und Nicht-Fußballer gebeten, die Schussrichtung vorherzusagen. Torhüter und Feldspieler erreichten bessere Leistungen als Nicht-Fußballer. In den 20°- und 30° Bedingungen zeigten sich die besten und in den 0°- und 40°-Bedingungen die schlechtesten Antizipationsleistungen. Außerdem wurden linksfüßige Schüsse schlechter eingeschätzt als rechtsfüßige Schüsse. Weitere Analysen ergaben, dass mit zunehmendem Anlaufwinkel seltener Schüsse in die unteren Torecken erwartet wurden und die Zuversicht in die Richtigkeit der Vorhersagen abnahm. Insgesamt deuten die als vorläufig zu betrachtenden Befunde an, dass die Antizipationsleistung von Torhütern durch den Anlaufwinkel von Elfmeterschützen beeinflusst wird.

In fünf Experteninterviews wird die Struktur und Anwendbarkeit dieses Modells in der Sportpsychologie exploriert. Das situative und kontextuell gebundene Wohlwollen und die Wertschätzung für den Athleten waren für die Befragten ebenso Bedingungen für Vertrauen wie die globale Zuschreibung vertrauensvoller Personmerkmale. Expertise spielte für die Befragten im Vertrauensprozess eine untergeordnete Rolle.

The focus of the paper is on a mixed methods multistrand study using qualitative as well as quantitative threads to develop and verify a set of coaching strategies focusing on team building and team leadership. Qualitative analyses showed that coaches do have a clear understanding of forming and leading a team, which could be shown by a specific set of strategies being used by high performance coaches from different team sports (basketball, football, handball, and volleyball). These strategies could be confirmed in a sequential quantitative study analyzing coaches' and players' attitudes toward the previously analyzed schemes. The results of this study are discussed in terms of methodical and practical implications.

AB - Investigated the role of the "hot-hand" fallacy in volleyball. The "hot-hand" belief in sports refers to the conviction that a player has a higher chance of making a shot after 2 or 3 successful shots than after 2 or 3 misses (resulting in "streaks"). This belief is usually considered a cognitive fallacy, although it has been conjectured that in basketball the defense will attack a "hot" player and prevent streaks from occurring. In volleyball, the net limits direct defensive counterstrategies, meaning that streaks can more likely emerge if a player is hot. The present 1st study on the hot hand in volleyball comprised 4 substudies. Results show that, according to questionnaires completed by 94 students of sports science (mean age 24 years), these athletes believe in the hot hand in volleyball (Study 1A). Moreover, analysis of the playing performance of top 26 1st-division players (Study 1B) showed that streaks do exist for half of the players. Furthermore, 16 coaches (mean age 38 years) watching recordings of volleyball games could detect players' performance variability and use it to make strategic decisions (Study 2A). Finally, 21 volleyball playmakers (sports science students, mean age 24 years) were also sensitive to streaks and relied on them when deciding to whom to allocate the ball (Study 2B). It is concluded that for volleyball the hot hand exists, coaches and playmakers are able to detect it, and playmakers tend to use it "adaptively," which results in more hits for a team.

AB - Von Trainerinnen und Trainern wird eine kontinuierliche Erweiterung ihres Wissensstandes durch die Nutzung aktueller Informationsangebote erwartet. Zum tatsächlichen Nutzungsverhalten und zum Informationsbedarf der Trainer existieren bislang jedoch nur wenige Befunde. Im vorliegenden Artikel werden ausgewählte Ergebnisse der Studie "Informationsversorgung von Trainerinnen und Trainern" vorgestellt. Das Forschungsprojekt wurde vom Bundesinstitut für Sportwissenschaft (BISp) gefördert und ist Teil der DOSB-Traineroffensive. In der Studie wurde das Informationsverhalten der Trainer im olympischen Spitzensport mit Hilfe von Expertengesprächen, Tagebuchstudien und einer quantitativen Befragung von mehr als 1500 Trainern untersucht. Aus qualitativer Sicht wurde das thematische und inhaltliche Spektrum in Fachzeitschriften, Rahmentrainingsplänen und Internetangeboten überprüft. Die Leitfrage der Studie lautete: Wie kann die Informationsversorgung von Trainern optimiert werden - in den Verbänden, in der Kommunikation untereinander, in der Aus- und Fortbildung und im Wissenschaftstransfer? Die im Beitrag zusammengefassten Ergebnisse konzentrieren sich auf das Zeitbudget der Trainer, ihre Nutzung von Informationsangeboten, den von Trainern artikulierten Informationsbedarf und die Barrieren im Wissenschafts-Praxis-Transfer. Im Kontext dieser ausgewählten Befunde werden zentrale Empfehlungen der Studie zur Optimierung der Informationsversorgung vorgestellt.

AB - Es wird davon ausgegangen, dass sportliche Trainingsprogramme sich aus drei Perioden zusammensetzen sollten: der (allgemeinen und speziellen) Vorbereitungs-, der Wettkampf- und der Übergangsperiode. Jede Trainingsperiode schließt körperliche, technische und taktische sowie psychologische Vorbereitungsmaßnahmen ein. Um ein hohes Leistungsniveau zu erreichen, sollte zwischen diesen Vorbereitungen in jeder Trainingsphase eine effektive Interaktion bestehen. Die Rhythmische Sportgymnastik wurde ausgewählt, um zu zeigen, wie die psychologische Vorbereitung - das Psychologische Fertigkeitstraining - effektiv in die körperliche, technische und taktische Vorbereitung integriert werden kann. Die Methode des Psychologischen Fertigkeitstrainings basiert auf der langfristigen Erfahrung des Erstautors als sportpsychologischer Berater und auf der theoretischen Basis des fertigkeitsorientierten Mentalen Übens.

AB - Berichtet wird über die Entwicklung und erste Erprobung eines Interventionsprogramms für Sportler zur Vermeidung von Versagen unter Leistungsdruck. Das Programm entstand auf der Grundlage von 33 Interviews mit Leistungssportlern verschiedener Disziplinenn, die nach wichtigen Wettkämpfen in Form einer Videokonfrontation geführt wurden. Hierin spiegelten sich wichtige Komponenten wider, die für das Erreichen einer optimalen Leistung im Wettkampf von hoher Bedeutung sind: Konzentration, Automatismus, Motivation, emotionales und körperliches Wohlbefinden sowie die Überzeugung, einen aktiven Einfluss im Wettkampf auszuüben. Das das aus sechs bis neun Phasen bestehende Interventionsprogramm muss auf jeden Sportler individuell angepasst werden. Um den Erfolg des Programms zu überprüfen, wurde es in neun Sitzungen über zwei Monate von einem Sportpsychologen mit einem 19-jährigen Leichtathleten durchgeführt, der bereits am ersten Teil der Untersuchung teilgenommen hatte und in einem Wettkampf versagt hatte. Nach Abschluss des Programms und späterer Teilnahme an einem wichtigen Wettkampf erfolgte eine erneute Videokonfrontation mit diesem Sportler. Der Athlet konnte sich in enormer Weise mental steigern. Beim zweiten Wettkampf war eine höhere Konzentration vorhanden, der Umgang mit dem Druck gelang besser und es fand eine annähernd automatisierte Aufgabenausführung statt. In weiteren Untersuchungen sollte das Interventionsprogramm mit mehreren Athleten aus verschiedenen Sportarten überprüft werden.

AB - Im Mittelpunkt der vorliegenden Studie steht die Frage, welchen Einfluss Sport und Bewegung auf die Motorik und auf die körpernahen Bereiche des Selbstkonzepts bei Erwachsenen mit geistiger Behinderung ausüben. Hierzu wurden die im Rahmen einer 12-monatigen quasi-experimentellen Feldstudie erhobenen Daten einer sportlich aktiven Versuchsgruppe (N=49) mit denen einer sportlich inaktiven Kontrollgruppe (N=21) verglichen. Die Ergebnisse zeigen die motorische Entwicklungsfähigkeit und Trainierbarkeit von Menschen mit geistiger Behinderung. Neben der Verbesserung im motorischen Bereich konnten, wenn auch geringer ausgeprägt, positive Veränderungen im Bereich des Körperselbstkonzepts beobachtet werden. Der besondere Stellenwert von Bewegung, Sport und Spiel für eine umfassende Persönlichkeitsentwicklung bei Menschen mit geistiger Behinderung wird durch die vorliegende Studie verdeutlicht.

AB - Conducted a 2-Phase study comparing the complex problem-solving competence of top-league versus local-league athletic team coaches. In Phase 1, a computer-simulated scenario ('heating oil company') was implemented to assess the domain-unspecific complex problem-solving strategies of 38 top-league basketball/handball coaches and 43 local-league basketball/handball coaches. The findings indicated superior general problem-solving competence in top-league coaches compared to local-league coaches. 14 top-league coaches and 13 local-league coaches agreed to participate in Phase 2 of the study six months later, at which time their real-life coaching behaviors (i.e., utterances during games) were analyzed for content. The analysis revealed that top-league coaches offered fewer, but more concrete instructions to their players compared to lower-league coaches. Furthermore, compared to local-league coaches, top-league coaches showed a stronger tendency to criticize and motivate their players. Practical implications for maximizing athletic team performance are considered.

AB - Zwang zur Optimierung ist in der Wirtschaft allgegenwärtig - ebenso wie im Spitzensport. Insofern überrascht es nicht, dass Leistungssportler und Trainer gern gesehene Referenten auf Tagungen und Kongressen der Wirtschaft sind. Schneller, höher und weiter - das ist kein Slogan, auf den der Spitzensport einen Alleinstellungsanspruch hat. Doch was lehren inhaltliche Analogien und Interdependenzen? Wie kann die Wirtschaft tatsächlich vom Spitzensport lernen? Diesen Fragen wird anhand einer Analyse des Führungs- und Trainingsstils des Fußballtrainers Jürgen Klopp nachgegangen. Dabei finden neun Erfolgsfaktoren Berücksichtigung: Zielformulierung, Motivation, hoher Individualitätsgrad, Individuum versus Team, Selbstvertrauen, Fehlermanagement, Wir-Gefühl, Veränderung und Respekt. Aus der Perspektive der Führungsforschung gehört Jürgen Klopp zu den transformationalen Führungspersonen, die sich durch einen Führungsstil auszeichnen, der auf vier Komponenten beruht: Charisma beziehungsweise Vorbildfunktion des Führenden, Motivation durch Zukunftsvisionen, Anregung zur Eigenverantwortung sowie individuelle Berücksichtigung des Einzelnen.

Für den Sportbereich wird die attributionale Theorie des Leistungshandelns nach Weiner als besonders bedeutsam angeführt. Eine sportspezifische Ursachenliste für das Vierfelderschema von Weiner wird vorgestellt. Ursachen lassen sich hierbei anhand der Dimensionen Stabilität (stabil versus variabel) und Lokation (internal versus external) unterscheiden. Nach Anmerkungen dazu, was Ursachenzuschreibungen auslöst, werden kognitive und affektive Folgen von Attributionen thematisiert. Instrumente zur Erfassung von Attributionen werden vorgestellt. Für den Einsatz im Sport werden die "Wingate Sport Achievement Responsibility Scale" und die "Sport Attributional Style Scale" als besonders geeignet genannt. Bei der Erfassung von Attributionen wird zwischen reaktiven und spontanen Attributionen unterschieden. Auf spezielle Attributionsmuster und -verzerrungen wird eingegangen. Im Sport kommt dem selbstwertdienlichen Attributionsmuster "self-serving-bias" besondere Bedeutung zu. Abschließend werden die Ergebnisse verschiedener Studien zu Sportkommentierungen von Zuschauern, Fans, Trainern und Journalisten sowie Studien zur Veränderung von Attributionsmustern in Sportkommentaren referiert.

AB - Der Beitrag knüpft an den Artikel von Simen und Hartlieb "Konflikte nutzen, um Ziele gemeinsam zu erreichen - Konfliktmanagement für Trainer" in Leistungssport 2/2010 an. Da im Leistungssportbereich, wie dort beschrieben, eine systematische Auseinandersetzung mit dem Thema Konfliktmanagement bisher kaum stattfindet, stellen sich zwei Fragen: Welche Gründe haben Unternehmen, das Thema Konfliktmanagement auf ihre Agenda zu setzen, und inwieweit sind diese auch für den Leistungssport relevant? Was zeichnet ein systematisches Konfliktmanagement aus und worauf könnte eine erfolgreiche Umsetzung im Leistungssport basieren? Im Folgenden wird zunächst ein kurzer Überblick über den aktuellen Stand zum Konfliktmanagement in der deutschen Wirtschaft gegeben. Anschließend folgt ein Blick auf die Hintergründe, die diese Entwicklung gefördert haben. Einen Schwerpunkt bildet dabei die differenzierte Betrachtung von Konfliktkosten (Kostendimension Person, Kostendimension Team, Dimension Organisation). Abschließend werden die Ziele und Instrumente des Konfliktmanagements im Leistungssport dargestellt. In allen Abschnitten wird versucht, einen Transfer zwischen den Erfahrungen aus der Wirtschaft und der spezifischen Situation im Leistungssport herzustellen. Dabei wird sowohl auf Praxiserfahrungen als Berater für Großunternehmen im Bereich Konfliktmanagement als auch auf Erkenntnisse aus gemeinsamen Veranstaltungen mit Trainern aus dem Leistungssport (z. B. Fortbildungen für Bundestrainer und Landestrainer im Auftrag der Trainerakademie Köln oder von Sportverbänden) zurückgegriffen.

Im Rahmen der Untersuchung wurden insgesamt 80 weibliche und 80 männliche Sportler untersucht, die entweder Fußball, Geräteturnen oder Mittel- bzw. Langstreckenlauf betrieben oder zur Gruppe der nicht sportaktiven Probanden gehörten. Neben der mit dem "Mental Rotation Test" (MRT) erhobenen mentalen Rotationsfähigkeit der Probanden wurde mit dem "Zahlenverbindungstest" (ZVT) die kognitive Verarbeitungsgeschwindigkeit überprüft, um daraus resultierende mögliche Gruppenunterschiede zu identifizieren. Anhand der Ergebnisse des MRT konnte ein Geschlechtseffekt zugunsten der Männer und ein Effekt der Sportart zugunsten der Geräteturner festgestellt werden. Im ZVT ergaben sich keine signifikanten Unterschiede hinsichtlich Geschlecht oder Sportart.

Konkret ging es um die Vorbereitung der Deutschen Volleyball-Nationalmannschaft der Herren auf ein Vorqualifikationsturnier zu den Olympischen Spielen 2012 in London durch ein Projektteam, nachdem es in der Folge einer erfolglos gespielten Europameisterschaft zu einer Trennung vom bis dahin zuständigen Bundestrainer gekommen war. Die theoretischen Grundlagen des systemischen Projektansatzes, die Gewichtung und konkrete Ausgestaltung der Turniervorbereitung, in deren Mittelpunkt die psychischen und sozialen Grundlagen sportlicher Leistung standen, werden erläutert. Dabei werden auch die natürlichen Reibungen zwischen herkömmlichen und neuen Rollendefinitionen (selbstorganisierte Führung der Mannschaft versus Außenführung durch einen Bundestrainer) im systemisch angelegten Prozesscoaching deutlich gemacht. Das Projekt wurde erfolgreich abgeschlossen, die deutsche Mannschaft gewann das Vorqualifikationsturnier.

AB - Auf der Basis videobasierter Aufzeichnungen von Trainer-Athlet-Interaktionen wird die Bedeutung des Körpers für die Herstellung sozialer Situationen, in denen körperliche und visuelle Handlungen in Wissen transformiert werden, diskutiert. Aus einer wissenssoziologischen Perspektive werden Verbindungen zwischen einer visuellen Soziologie und einer Körpersoziologie eruiert, die für die Analyse körperzentrierter Interaktionen im Sport theoretische und empirische Anschlussmöglichkeiten eröffnen. Am Beispiel einer Trainingssituation in der Sportart Trampolinturnen wird aufgezeigt, wie sich Akteure unter Rückgriff auf visuelle und taktile Ressourcen im Interaktionsverlauf aneinander orientieren, neue Wissensformen produzieren und sozial geteilte Wissensvorräte aktualisieren. Das Resultat der sequenzanalytischen Video-Interaktions-Analyse gründet in der intersubjektiven Herstellung von Körperspannung, die in dieser Form als handlungsrelevantes Sonderwissen für die Praxis des Trampolinturnens gedeutet werden kann.

AB - Dass die physische Attraktivität eines Menschen seinen Erfolg in den unterschiedlichsten Lebensbereichen beeinflusst, ist in der sozialpsychologischen Literatur vielfach belegt. Nicht immer kann dabei allerdings davon ausgegangen werden, dass attraktive Menschen wirklich produktiver sind. Vielmehr werden die im jeweiligen sozialen Handlungskontext relevanten Interaktionspartner und Entscheidungsträger attraktive Menschen oftmals schlichtweg besser behandeln. Eine solche substanzlose Privilegierung attraktiver Menschen ist immer dann besonders wahrscheinlich, wenn keine objektiven Leistungsmaßstäbe existieren und die Kriterien der Leistungsbewertung intransparent bleiben. Da Leistungen im Profisport gut dokumentiert sind und vergleichsweise objektiv gemessen werden können, wird für die 483 Fußballprofis, die in der Saison 2007/2008 bei den 18 Mannschaften der 1. Bundesliga zum Einsatz kamen, untersucht, wie sich ihre Attraktivität auf die Bewertung ihrer Leistung durch Sportreporter und den Trainer auswirkt. Im Ergebnis zeigt sich, dass bei Kontrolle objektiver Leistungen die Urteile der Sportreporter durch die Attraktivität der Spieler nicht wesentlich beeinflusst werden, während ein solcher Einfluss bei den Urteilen der Trainer sehr wohl existiert. Dies wird auf die größere Transparenz und die stärkere Regelgebundenheit der journalistischen Urteilsbildung zurückgeführt.

AB - Die Vielschichtigkeit und Vielgestaltigkeit visueller Praktiken in der sozialen Interaktion wird am Beispiel des Boxens untersucht. Beim Boxkampf scheint es sich zunächst um eine körperliche Auseinandersetzung zwischen zwei Beteiligten zu handeln, bei welcher der physischen Kraft und Geschicklichkeit maßgeblicher Einfluss auf Sieg oder Niederlage zukommt. In der vorliegenden Fallstudie wird jedoch aufgezeigt, dass auch visuelle Praktiken verschiedener am Kampfgeschehen beteiligter Personen großen Anteil am Erfolg haben. Diese Praktiken beziehen sich auf verschachtelte und sich überlagernde "skopische Regime" im Boxsport, die jeweils spezifische normative Erwartung an die Sichtbarmachung von Handlungen ebenso wie an deren Verdeckung stellen. Hierzu zählt sowohl die ostentative Umsetzung der permanent vokal in den Ring gerufenen Anweisungen des Trainers durch den Boxer als auch dessen demonstrative, an den Ringrichter adressierte Einhaltung der Boxregeln, seine betonte Performanz des Nichtgetroffenseins beim Schlag des Gegners in Richtung des Punktrichters und seine Zurschaustellung von sportlicher Fitness, moralischer Integrität und unerschrockener Vitalität gegenüber den Zuschauern. All diese Sichtbarkeiten müssen, jeweils adressatenspezifisch, vom Boxer in seinen Einzelhandlungen gewissermaßen "aufgeschichtet" werden. Nicht zuletzt handelt es sich beim Sehen im Bereich des Boxgeschehens selbst sogar um eine zwischen Athlet und Trainer verteilte Tätigkeit, die Sichtbarkeiten, aber auch körperliche Aktivitäten im Hinblick auf die visuellen Erwartungen aller anderen Anwesenden (Gegner, Richter, Zuschauer) manipuliert. Sehen wird so zu einem intersubjektiven, sozialen Gut, das kooperativ erzeugt wird. (Autorenreferat)

AB - Eine technische Lösung zur Erweiterung des videogestützten Techniktrainings im Wasserspringen um die interne Perspektive wird vorgestellt. Im Wasserspringen sind Imitationsübungen fester Bestandteil des Trainings. Diese praxisnahe Variante des mentalen Trainings steht im Einklang mit dem PETTLEP-Ansatz, welcher postuliert, dass mentales Training mit der praktischen Ausführung in den Faktoren Physical, Environment, Task, Timing, Learning, Emotion und Perspective möglichst übereinstimmen sollte, um die Effektivität zu maximieren. Deshalb soll die Bewegungsrepräsentation während der Imitationsübungen durch Videomaterial der einzelnen Sprünge aus interner Perspektive erweitert werden. Die technische Lösung, mit der es gelungen ist, eine Vielzahl an Sprüngen im Kunstspringen aufzunehmen, wird beschrieben. Abschließend wird die Bedeutung der Arbeit mit Videomaterial aus der internen Perspektive in Bezug auf den PETTLEP-Ansatz, die Einsatzgebiete und Interventionsmöglichkeiten diskutiert.

AB - Potenziale bewegungs- und sporttherapeutischer Ansätze in der psychiatrischen Behandlung werden erörtert. Den Hintergrund bilden dabei die zunehmenden Belege für die Wirksamkeit und die positive Bewertung solcher Angebote durch die Patienten. Als entscheidend für einen nachhaltigen Erfolg wird die Entwicklung einer Eigenmotivation zu regelmäßiger körperlicher Aktivität während der stationären Behandlungsphase erachtet. Auf der Grundlage des Konzepts der motivationalen Gesprächsführung sollte angestrebt werden, dass der Patient zu einer eigenen und eigenmotivierten Entscheidung kommt, um die gewonnenen Effekte der Behandlung auf ambulanter Ebene aufrecht zu erhalten. Hierbei wird als hilfreich angesehen, wenn ein Zeitraum von drei oder sechs Monaten vereinbart wird, gefolgt von einer ehrlichen Evaluation der gemachten Erfahrungen mit der Möglichkeit, das Training zu modifizieren oder auch gänzlich einzustellen. Strategien zur Unterstützung der Entscheidungsbalance werden in diesem Zusammenhang dargestellt. Im klinischen Setting sollten Praxis und Psychoedukation in enger Abstimmung miteinander stattfinden. Der Nutzen einer Einbeziehung von Behandlungsmanualen, die Informationen über therapeutische Effekte und die heute bekannten Wirkmechanismen von Sport und Bewegung in einfacher und verständlicher Form enthalten und darüber hinaus mit einer praktischen Anleitung verbunden sind, wird betont.

AB - Der Bologna-Prozess bietet die Chance zur Entwicklung berufsfeldspezifischer Studiengänge etwa der Sportpsychologie im Leistungssport. Für die notwendige Kenntnis über die Anforderungen des Feldes, mögliche Tätigkeitsfelder sowie Beschäftigungschancen zukünftiger Absolventen existieren jedoch nur wenig belastbare Daten. Vor diesem Hintergrund wurden 98 im Leistungssport sportpsychologisch Tätige zu den Bereichen Qualifikationen, Kompetenzen, Tätigkeitsfelder und Perspektiven online befragt. Die Daten weisen auf die Bedeutung der Psychologie für das Berufsfeld hin, auch wenn ein anderer Zugang (Sportwissenschaften) möglich ist. Bei den Fachkompetenzen wurden von den Befragten sowohl psychologische als auch sportpsychologische Kenntnisse betont. Im Hinblick auf das spezielle Berufs- und Tätigkeitsfeld antworteten die Befragten, dass sie meist in mehreren Berufsfeldern tätig seien und speziell in der Sportpsychologie überwiegend in der Einzelbetreuung. Darüber hinaus sahen sie insgesamt gute Perspektiven für sich selbst und für zukünftige Sportpsychologen, wenngleich sie mit den finanziellen Bedingungen nicht ganz zufrieden waren. Implikationen der Ergebnisse für die Gestaltung von Studiengängen, für die Berufsaussichten angehender Sportpsychologen sowie für die Professionalisierung des Feldes werden umrissen. Es wird betont, dass die Fachdisziplin die Verbindung zur Psychologie erhalten und einheitliche Qualitätsstandards definieren sollte.

AB - Studien zum menschlichen Spiegelneuronensystem zeigen, dass die gleichen korrespondierenden Repräsentationen nicht nur bei der eigenen Ausführung einer Handlung, sondern auch beim Betrachten derselben Ausführung aktiviert werden. Dabei wird das Wahrnehmen fremder Handlungen durch die Bewegungserfahrung des Beobachters moduliert. Es wird der Frage nachgegangen, ob motorische Expertise nicht nur das Wahrnehmen fremder Handlungen beeinflusst, sondern ob sich Bewegungsexpertise auch auf die Leistung in mentalen Rotationstests mit menschlichen Figuren auswirkt. Dafür wurden 32 Sportler und Sportlerinnen mit (z. B. Kunstturnern) und ohne Rotationsexpertise in einer Rotationsaufgabe, welche eine perspektivische Transformation provoziert, getestet. Stimuli waren Bilder einer weiblichen Person in Vorder- und Rückansicht, die in einer von acht verschiedenen Winkelorientierungen dargeboten wurden. Die Aufgabe der Probanden bestand darin, schnellstmöglich zu entscheiden, ob die dargestellte Person den rechten oder linken Arm seitlich ausgestreckt hält. Die Ergebnisse zeigen einen selektiven Einfluss motorischer Expertise auf die Rotationsleistung. Danach können Rotationsexperten andere Personen nicht generell schneller identifizieren. Sie profitieren jedoch insbesondere dann von ihrer Bewegungserfahrung, wenn Personen in ungewöhnlichen, nicht-alltäglichen Körperorientierungen gezeigt werden. Der Vorteil für Rotationsexperten zeigt sich somit nur dann, wenn sie ihr bewegungsspezifisches Wissen, d. h. ihre Bewegungserfahrungen mit Drehungen und ungewöhnlichen Körperorientierungen im Raum, nutzen können.

In diesem Zusammenhang können QM-Ergebnisse in Bezug auf die Qualität von sportpsychologischer Betreuung anhand von drei Kriteriumsebenen dargestellt werden: (1) des Betreuungsprozesses selbst, etwa Zufriedenheit und Wohlbefinden im Rahmen von Betreuungshandlungen, (2) der psychischen und psychosozialen Handlungskompetenzen, etwa Techniken des taktischen Handelns, Selbstmotivierung und Selbstkontrolle und (3) der Gesundheit, Persönlichkeit und sportlichen Leistung des Athleten. Um Qualitätsmerkmale zu sichern, werden Maßnahmen und Prozesse auf der Basis von vier Bestimmungsfaktoren erörtert: (1) prozessassoziierte Institutionen, (2) der Sportpsychologe selbst (seine individuellen aufgabenbezogenen Kompetenzen und Valenzen), (3) Aufgabenbedingung und Strukturen der Betreuung und (4) soziale Strukturen und Ressourcen. Abschließend werden sowohl die Orientierung an Stakeholdern als auch die Kommunikation über Qualität und Qualitätsprozesse als Schlüsselprozesse von QM innerhalb dieser komplexen Struktur identifiziert.

Dabei wird davon ausgegangen, dass sportliche Trainingsprogramme aus drei Perioden bestehen sollten: der Vorbereitungsperiode (VP; allgemein, AVP und spezifisch, SVP), der Wettkampfperiode (WP) und der Übergangsperiode (ÜP). Jede Trainingsperiode beinhaltet körperliche, technische, taktische und psychologische Vorbereitungsmaßnahmen. Um ein hohes Leistungsniveau zu erreichen, sollte zwischen diesen eine effektive Interaktion bestehen. Die Kampfsportart Judo wurde ausgewählt, um zu demonstrieren, wie die psychologische Vorbereitung (Psychologisches Fertigkeitstraining) effektiv in die konditionelle, technische und taktische Vorbereitung integriert werden kann. Dieser Ansatz basiert auf der langjährigen Erfahrung als sportpsychologischer Berater und auf der theoretischen Grundlage des fertigkeitsbezogenen mentalen Trainings.

Weniger Wissen liegt jedoch über die leistungs- und saisonabhängige Veränderung der Unterstützungssysteme vor. In dieser Studie wurden 17 Nationalmannschaftsmitglieder des Deutschen Skiverbands zweimal bezüglich ihrer sozialen Unterstützung befragt. Es zeigt sich, dass die Unterstützung durch die Mutter und den Trainer sowie die Qualität der wahrgenommenen Unterstützung leistungsunabhängig über die Saisonvorbereitung stiegen. Leistungsabhängige saisonstabile Unterschiede bestanden für die Kontakthäufigkeit zu den Netzwerkmitgliedern. Interaktionseffekte waren nicht zu beobachten. Die Ergebnisse regen dazu an, den Kontakt zwischen Athlet, Eltern und Trainer enger zu gestalten und die Kommunikation zu verstärken, um positive Leistungseffekte zu erzielen.

AB - In einer Befragung von 263 Übungsleitern im Sport standen folgende Fragen im Mittelpunkt: Welche Motive und Ziele nennen Übungsleiter im Kinder- und Jugendsport? Über welche Schwierigkeiten berichten sie? Gibt es dabei Unterschiede zwischen Leistungsklassen oder Sportarten? Welche unterschiedlichen Störungen stellen Übungsleiter mit unterschiedlichen persönlichen Zielen in den Vordergrund? Die Befragten nannten häufig Störungen in Bezug auf Desinteresse, mangelnde Aufmerksamkeit und mangelnde Zuverlässigkeit der Kinder und Jugendlichen. Die Berücksichtigung unterschiedlicher Sportarten und Leistungsklassen wies auf Schwerpunkte bei Erwartungen und wahrgenommenen Störungen hin. Außerdem zeigte sich, dass spezifische Erwartungen mit unterschiedlichen Schwerpunkten in den wahrgenommenen Störungen des Trainingsbetriebs einhergehen. Konsequenzen für den didaktischen Aufbau von Fortbildungsmaßnahmen zur Förderung der sozialen und erzieherischen Kompetenz von Übungsleitern werden abgeleitet. Dabei wird insbesondere die Klärung der persönlichen Ziele und Werte bezüglich der Trainertätigkeit für notwendig erachtet, um eine rationale Grundlage für die Bewältigung möglicher Diskrepanzen zwischen den eigenen Zielen und der Realität des Trainingsbetriebs zu finden.

AB - In der Mannschaftssportart Frauenfußball wird der Einfluss der aus Athletensicht wahrgenommenen Trainer-Athlet-Interaktion auf die Zufriedenheit der Sportlerinnen in Abhängigkeit vom Geschlecht des Trainers untersucht. In einer querschnittlichen Fragebogenstudie wurden neben der subjektiven Beurteilung des Führungsverhaltens (Leadership Scale for Sports; LSS) und des motivationalen Trainingsklimas (Perceived Motivational Climate in Sports Questionnaire; PMCSQ) Daten zur Zufriedenheit von 150 Sportlerinnen (10 Mannschaften) von fünf weiblichen und fünf männlichen Trainern der 2. und 3. Liga erfasst. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die Trainer-Athlet-Interaktion im Zusammenhang mit dem Geschlecht des Trainers und dem Wettkampfniveau der Athletinnen betrachtet werden muss. Trainerinnen werden entgegen den Erwartungen weniger sozial unterstützend, weniger belohnend und weniger demokratisch eingeschätzt als ihre männlichen Kollegen. Spielerinnen der 2. Liga nehmen das Trainingsklima erwartungsgemäß stärker wettbewerbsorientiert wahr als Athletinnen der 3. Liga. Die Zufriedenheit der Athletinnen geht insgesamt mit einem ausgeprägt aufgabenorientierten und wenig wettbewerbsorientierten Trainingsklima einher. Allerdings sind verschiedene Faktoren der Trainer-Athlet-Interaktion für die Zufriedenheit der Spielerinnen verantwortlich, differenziert man nach dem Geschlecht des Trainers.

AB - Seit den 1990er Jahren tritt der Alterssport zunehmend auch in das Blickfeld der psychologischen Forschung. Neben motivationalen Aspekten liegt hierbei das Hauptaugenmerk auf dem positiven Einfluss von sportlicher Aktivität auf die physische und psychische Gesundheit. Alterssport wird dabei aber nach wie vor zumeist unter ausschließlich funktionellen Aspekten betrachtet; eine solche, auf die Kompensation defizitärer Zustände ausgerichtete Sicht auf den Alterssport spiegelt gesellschaftlich weit verbreitete Bilder von Alter (Hinfälligkeit) und Sport (Leistungsfähigkeit, Jugendlichkeit) wider. Vor dem Hintergrund neuerer Arbeiten werden ein solches Defizitmodell und die damit verbundenen Stereotype hinterfragt. Plädiert wird für einen differenzierteren und konstruktiven Blick auf den Alterssport und eine damit verbundene stärkere Berücksichtigung der spezifischen Bedürfnislagen älterer Menschen.

AB - Examined the impact of emotion on performance monitoring. EEG data were recorded while 15 females (mean age 20 years) from a tennis club performed a spatial Stroop task. Emotional feedback was given after incorrect responses by the team captain; it included verbal admonishment, verbal encouragement, or no feedback. Error negativity/error-related negativity (Ne/ERN) of the evoked potential, reaction time, and error rates were analyzed. Results showed significantly slower reaction times and higher error rates for incompatible than for compatible trials. Furthermore, admonishment was associated with significantly reduced ERN as compared to the control condition. Source localization revealed a shift in ERN to the more rostral areas of the anterior cingulate cortex for the admonishment condition and to the more caudal areas in the encouragement and control conditions. It is suggested that the decrease in ERN reflects diminished error or conflict monitoring because of verbal admonishment. It concluded that the results provide evidence for the view that punishment exerts an influence on response monitoring.

AB - In der vorliegenden anwendungsorientierten sportpsychologisch akzentuierten Studie werden spezifische Aspekte des Selbst- und Fremdkonzepts von Leistungssportlern mit Behinderung aus unterschiedlichen Sportarten untersucht. Die Befragung mittels eines spezifischen Fragebogens wurde in einer Gesamtgruppe von 75 Leistungssportlern mit Behinderung durchgeführt. Sie setzte sich aus 58 männlichen und 17 weiblichen Leistungssportlern zusammen. Die 75 Athleten umfassten 44 frühbehinderte und 29 spätbehinderte Leistungssportler. Ferner wurde eine Befragung bei zehn Sportjournalisten zum Selbst- und Fremdkonzept von Athleten mit Behinderung vorgenommen. Außerdem wurde eine Interviewstudie zu ausgewählten Aspekten des Selbst- und Fremdkonzepts von Athleten mit Behinderung aus der Perspektive von zehn Leistungssportlern, fünf Trainern, fünf Funktionären und zehn Leistungssportlern durchgeführt. Überdies wurde die Berichterstattung in ausgewählten Printmedien und im Fernsehen vor, während und nach den Sommer Paralympics 2000 in Sydney sowie vor, während und nach den Winter Paralympics 2002 in Salt Lake City analysiert. Die Gesamtgruppe der Leistungssportler mit Behinderung wies unter anderem ein bei weitem besseres Selbstkonzept der körperlichen Effizienz und eine höhere Selbstakzeptanz des Körpers als die weibliche Normgruppe auf. In Bezug auf die Zufriedenheit mit der eigenen Person, mit der Gesundheit und mit dem Kontakt mit den Freunden, Bekannten und Verwandten lagen die Werte in der Gesamtgruppe der behinderten Athleten erheblich niedriger als die Vergleichswerte der männlichen bzw. weiblichen Normpopulation. In Hinsicht auf die Athleten-Identifikation zeigte die Gesamtgruppe der behinderten Leistungssportler hohe Zustimmungsraten bei den Aussagen, dass sie viele Ziele im Sport hatten und dass sie sich als Athleten betrachteten. Die Beurteilungen der Fremdakzeptanz hinsichtlich der Wahrnehmung in der Bevölkerung als "Leistungssportler mit Handicap" waren in allen zehn Persönlichkeitsmerkmalen signifikant positiver als die des "Behinderten". Aus dem Vergleich der weiblichen und männlichen Athleten ging unter anderem hervor, dass die Beurteilungen der Selbstakzeptanz und der körperlichen Effizienz bei den weiblichen behinderten Leistungssportlern im Trend höher waren als bei den männlichen Leistungssportlern. Hinsichtlich der Lebenszufriedenheit zeigten die männlichen Sportler höhere Werte bei ihrer eigenen Vitalität sowie bei der Bewertung ihrer charakterlichen Eigenarten bzw. ihren Wesensmerkmalen als die weiblichen Leistungssportler. Die männlichen Leistungssportler erachteten sich in der Wahrnehmung durch die Bevölkerung als Behinderte als stabiler, unabhängiger, aktiver und gesünder als die weiblichen Leistungssportler. Aus dem Vergleich der frühbehinderten und spätbehinderten Athleten wurde deutlich, dass die frühbehinderten Leistungssportler bei den Komponenten der Gesundheit und des körperlichen Befindens einen höheren, jedoch bei der körperlichen Effizienz einen niedrigeren Punktwert aufwiesen als die spätbehinderten Leistungssportler. Bezüglich der Lebenszufriedenheit waren die frühbehinderten Athleten zufriedener mit der Art und Weise ihres Lebens, mit ihrer Vitalität, ihren eigenen Fähigkeiten und Fertigkeiten und ihrer charakterlichen Eigenart als die spätbehinderten Athleten. Die Journalisten berichteten über den Breitensport der Behinderten mit mittlerer Häufigkeit. Im Gegensatz hierzu war die Häufigkeit der Berichte über den Leistungssport der Behinderten erheblich höher. Die befragten Journalisten waren in Bezug auf die Berichterstattung mit der Interaktion mit dem Nationaltrainer und den behinderten Athleten weitgehend zufrieden. Aus den Interviews mit den Leistungssportlern mit Behinderung in Hinsicht auf das Selbstkonzept ging unter anderem hervor, dass sich bei den früh- wie spätbehinderten Athleten durch das Sporttreiben und die damit verbundenen Erfolge ein positives leistungsbezogenes Selbstkonzept entwickelt hatte. Die Aussagen der Athleten zum Fremdkonzept verdeutlichten, dass das soziale Selbstkonzept sowohl bei den früh- wie spätbehinderten Athleten je nach Erfahrungsbereich unterschiedliche negative Nuancen in Bezug auf die Akzeptanz als Behinderter aufwies. Da einige Trainer vor Beginn ihrer Trainertätigkeit im Behindertenbereich bereits im Nichtbehindertenbereich gearbeitet hatten, ergaben sich für sie völlig neue Einblicke in die Notwendigkeiten, Besonderheiten und Spezifika der behinderten Athleten. Es wurde konstatiert, dass die Leistungssportler mit Behinderung im Vergleich zu weniger durch den Sport bekannten Personen in der Öffentlichkeit eine höhere Akzeptanz erhielten. Den Leistungssport der Athleten mit Handicap erachteten die meisten Trainer trotz einiger aufgeführter Unzulänglichkeiten in einem positiven Entwicklungstrend. Sie gaben als Gründe hierfür unter anderem eine bessere Organisation des Trainings und Wettkampfs sowie die Bindung der Paralympics an die Olympischen Spiele an. Für die meisten Journalisten stand die Berichterstattung über die sportlichen Leistungen und nicht die Darbietung mitleiderregender Geschichten im Vordergrund ihrer Arbeit. Im Rahmen der Medienanalyse wurde eine Untersuchung der Berichterstattung in ausgewählten Printmedien und Fernsehsendungen bei den Sommer Paralympics 2000 in Sydney und bei den Winter Paralympics 2002 in Salt Lake City vorgenommen. Die Berichterstattung in den ausgewählten überregionalen und regionalen Tageszeitungen wurde insgesamt sachangemessen und fachkompetent durchgeführt. Einige regionale Tageszeitungen ließen ein höheres Engagement in der Berichterstattung erkennen als einige überregionale Tageszeitungen. Die regionalen Printmedien befassten sich vorrangig mit den Erfolgen bzw. Misserfolgen der aus ihrer Region kommenden Athleten. Die Fernsehsendungen der ARD und des ZDF wurden von sachkundigen und kompetenten Moderatoren in Sydney und Salt Lake City geleitet. Die Sendungen ließen eine fundierte und sachangemessene Darstellung des Leistungssports der Athleten mit Behinderung erkennen und erreichten eine beachtliche Zuschauerresonanz.

AB - Die vorliegende Dissertation beschäftigt sich mit den Faktoren, die zu einem pädagogisch-psychologisch tragfähigen Verhältnis zwischen Sportpsychologen einerseits und Athleten, Trainern, Trainerstab, Umfeld sowie Öffentlichkeit andererseits beitragen. Dazu wurden zehn sportpsychologische Experten mit langjährigen Erfahrungen in der Praxis des Spitzensports in leitfadengeführten Interviews befragt, um deren Agieren in der Praxis zu beleuchten und zieldienliches Verhalten abzuleiten. Die Interviews wurden nach den Vorgaben der Grounded Theory in mehreren Kodierprozessen analysiert. Im Forschungsprozess wurde auf Grundlage der Datenauswertung das "Systemtheoretische Modell zielführender Kommunikationsbeziehungen von Sportpsychologen im Spitzensport" entwickelt. In diesem werden sowohl die Kompetenzen von Sportpsychologen, die für die Bewältigung der Praxisanforderungen des Spitzensports bedeutsam sind, als auch die förderlichen Kommunikationsbeziehungen zwischen Sportpsychologen und den im Spitzensport beteiligten Personen, dargestellt. Dabei wird insbesondere auf die zirkulären Wechselwirkungen der einzelnen autopoietischen Systeme eingegangen, sowie auf deren strukturelle Kopplung aus systemtheoretischer Perspektive. Die Implikationen des entwickelten Modells werden aus theoretischer und praxisorientierter Perspektive diskutiert. Zudem werden zukünftige Forschungsfragen aufgeworfen.

AB - Der Erkenntnisstand zum Einfluss körperlich-sportlicher Betätigung auf die psychische Gesundheit wird im Überblick dargestellt. Nach einigen definitorischen Hinweisen wird dabei im Einzelnen auf folgende Gesichtspunkte eingegangen: Bezüge zwischen sportlicher Aktivität und Selbstgefühl, Bezüge zwischen sportlicher Aktivität und Stressempfinden, Bezüge zwischen Breitensport und seelischer Gesundheit, Wirkungen von sportlicher Aktivität bei Angsterkrankungen und Depressionen. In der abschließenden Bewertung der Erkenntnislage wird die Auffassung vertreten, dass trotz uneinheitlicher Befundlage die Annahme plausibel erscheint, dass sportliche Aktivitäten präventive und kurative Wirkungen aufweisen. Sportliche Aktivitäten bedingen in der Regel - vermittelt über biologische Parameter - ein Mehr an Gehirngesundheit, eine Zunahme von subjektiver Kompetenzerfahrung und somit eine Erhöhung der eigenen Selbstwirksamkeit. Darüber hinaus vermitteln sie - in der Gruppe durchgeführt - auch soziale Kontakte.

Ausgehend von einer Zusammenfassung von Erkenntnissen zur aktuellen gesundheitlichen Situation der Bevölkerung in Deutschland allgemein werden Daten aus einer schriftlichen Befragung von 517 Strafgefangenen präsentiert, die diese als Klientel mit hohem Bedarf an Gesundheitsförderung ausweisen. So wurde beispielsweise ermittelt, dass 83 % der Befragten Raucher waren und bei 68 % Suchtkrankheiten vorlagen. Vor diesem Hintergrund werden Vorschläge zur Gesundheitsförderung durch Sport bei Strafgefangenen entwickelt. Diese umfassen Sportangebote zur Vorbeugung von Herz-Kreislauf-Erkrankungen, von Erkrankungen des Muskel- und Skelettsystems sowie von psychischen Erkrankungen. Abschließend wird auf die Frage nach möglichen Kriterien für die Auswahl von Sportarten für die Gesundheitsförderung im Strafvollzug eingegangen.

AB - Theorie und Praxis von sport- und bewegungstherapeutischen Programmen in der Behandlung von psychischen Erkrankungen werden im Überblick dargestellt. Nach einleitenden Anmerkungen zum Zusammenhang zwischen Bewegung und Gesundheit werden Bezüge zwischen Sport und Psyche hergestellt. Vor diesem Hintergrund wird ein Überblick über die Befundlage zur Wirksamkeit von körperlichem Training bei depressiven Erkrankungen, Angsterkrankungen, Psychosen aus dem schizophrenen Formenkreis und Suchterkrankungen gegeben. In diesem Zusammenhang wird auch auf unerwünschte Nebenwirkungen des Sporttreibens hingewiesen. Vorgehensweisen bei der praktischen Umsetzung von Sport und Bewegungsprogrammen bei Menschen mit psychischen Störungen werden besprochen. Darüber hinaus werden die biologischen und psychologischen Wirkmechanismen von Sport beschrieben. Für depressive Störungen und Angsterkrankungen konnte in kontrollierten Studien eine therapeutische Wirksamkeit von Ausdauertraining (teilweise auch von Krafttraining) gezeigt werden. Die Wirkung bei Psychosen des schizophrenen Formenkreises, Sucht und anderen psychischen Erkrankungen ist empirisch noch nicht ausreichend abgesichert. Für die Umsetzung sporttherapeutischer Maßnahmen in die Praxis werden Motivierung und Anleitung des Patienten für wesentlich erachtet. Es wird deutlich gemacht, dass Ausdauertraining direkte Effekte auf den Hirnstoffwechsel aufweist: veränderte Empfindlichkeit zentraler serotonerger Rezeptoren, Anstieg des atrialen natriuretischen Peptids und des "brain-derived neurotrophic factor". Darüber hinaus wird darauf verwiesen, dass Ausdauertraining die innere Überzeugung stärkt, selbst etwas zur Verbesserung der eigenen Situation beitragen zu können.

Es wird der Frage nachgegangen, ob Leistungssport prinzipiell als eine krankhafte Überkompensation von zugrundeliegenden Mangellagen verstanden werden muss. Neben Motiven eines leistungsorientierten Sporttreibens werden biografische Voraussetzungen für eine befriedigende Kompensation verdeutlicht. In Abgrenzung zur Kompensation werden Merkmale einer Überkompensation beleuchtet und psychische Erkrankungen im Spannungsfeld von gesunder Kompensation und krankhafter Überkompensation verortet. Anhand der Überlegungen werden Anregungen für ein psychosoziales Krankheitsverständnis des Phänomens der psychischen Erkrankungen im Leistungssport gegeben.

AB - Die bestehende Literatur zum Thema mentale Toughness im Sport wird zusammengefasst. Die Literaturübersicht zeigt, dass es zunächst mittels qualitativer Studien gelang, konzeptuelle Klarheit zu schaffen und Orientierungshilfen für die Operationalisierung des Konstrukts bereitzustellen. In der Folge wurden über das Psychological Performance Inventory (PPI) hinaus weitere quantitative Messinstrumente entwickelt, deren Validität und Reliabilität ansatzweise dokumentiert sind. Mit Hilfe dieser Instrumente konnte nachgewiesen werden, dass zwischen mentaler Toughness und sportlichem Erfolg ein Zusammenhang besteht. Mit Blick auf die möglichen Wirkungsmechanismen deutet sich an, dass mental starke Athleten über günstigere Bewältigungsstrategien verfügen. Obschon Konsens besteht, dass mentale Toughness einem überdauernden Merkmal entspricht, konnte belegt werden, dass sich auch mit Hilfe eines Mentaltrainings positive Effekte erzielen lassen. Zum aktuellen Zeitpunkt besteht ein großer Bedarf an quantitativen, längsschnittlichen und experimentell angelegten Studien. Ebenso ist der biopsychologische Ansatz ein vielversprechender Zugang für weitere Studien.

AB - Inhalt dieser Arbeit war es, ein Coaching zur Implementierung und Aufrechterhaltung von Sportaktivität theoriegeleitet zu entwickeln, das Konzept an Multiplikatoren zu vermitteln und sowohl den Prozess als auch die Ergebnisse des Coachings zu evaluieren. Teilnehmer der Studie waren 13 sportpädagogisch ausgebildete Fachkräfte, die die Coachings mit je zwei Besuchern eines Fitness-Studios durchführten. Nach sieben Coaching-Sitzungen in einem Zeitraum von zehn Wochen wurde entsprechend des dynamischen Selbstregulationsmodells die Evaluation des Coachings auf drei Ebenen durchgeführt: Als psychometrische Variablen wurden die sportbezogene Selbstwirksamkeit und die sportbezogene Selbstkonkordanz herangezogen; auf der biometrischen Ebene wurden Gewicht, Blutdruck sowie Ruhe- und Belastungspuls gemessen; die Häufigkeit und die Stabilität der sportlichen Aktivität wurden durch die Verwaltungssysteme der Fitness-Studios objektiv gemessen. Der Erfassung der Variablen lag ein Ein-Gruppen-Prätest-Posttest-Design zu Grunde. Nach weiteren zehn Wochen erfolgte eine Follow-up-Erhebung zum Trainingsverhalten. Um den Effekt des Coachings auf die Veränderung im Trainingsverhalten nachzuweisen, wurde ein ABA-Einzelfallversuchsplan eingesetzt. Ergänzend erfolgte die systematische Darstellung der Fallgeschichten von fünf Klienten. Es konnte nachgewiesen werden, dass das Coaching einen positiven und nachhaltigen Effekt auf die Trainingshäufigkeit und Trainingsstabilität der Klienten hatte. Sowohl der Gesamtwert der sportbezogenen Selbstwirksamkeit als auch der sportbezogenen Selbstkonkordanz stiegen nach dem Coaching signifikant an.

AU - Weidig, Thorsten.

LA - German 
AB - Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit war es, die Trainerkompetenz in Spiel- und Wettkampfpausen zu erfassen und zu beurteilen. Mit dem Pausenverhaltensfragebogen (PVF) wurde ein diagnostisches Instrument entwickelt, das Trainerverhalten getrennt für Mannschafts- und Individualsportarten aus den drei Perspektiven Trainer, Sportler und Sportpsychologe erfasst. Die Mannschaftssportversion mit 11 Skalen und 44 Items wurde an insgesamt 379 lizenzierten Trainern und 177 Spielern aus verschiedenen Mannschaftssportarten überprüft, die Individualsportversion mit 10 Skalen und 40 Items an 205 lizenzierten Trainern und 106 Athleten aus verschiedenen Individualsportarten. Die inneren Konsistenzen der Trainer- und Sportlerfragebögen erwiesen sich als zufrieden stellend bis gut. Die Untersuchung der Zusammenhänge zwischen dem PVF und dem Erholungs-Belastungs-Fragebogen für Trainer von Kallus und Kellmann stützte die Erwartung, dass der PVF trainerspezifisches Verhalten misst. Die Anwendung des PVF und die systematische Beobachtung zweier Trainer des Spitzensports zeigten einen handlungskompetenten Trainer, bei dem jedoch ein unerwartet schlechter Spielverlauf und die Unzufriedenheit mit der Leistung der eigenen Mannschaft dysfunktionales Pausenverhalten provozieren können; beim zweiten Trainer konnte ein grundsätzlicher Mangel an Handlungskompetenz bei gleichzeitiger Selbstüberschätzung eben jener festgestellt werden. Funktionales Pausenverhalten scheint die Leistungsentfaltung der Spieler im weiteren Spiel positiv zu beeinflussen, während dysfunktional ausgeprägtes Trainerverhalten leistungshemmend zu wirken scheint. Durch den Einsatz eines zusätzlich entwickelten Screening-lnstruments zur Erfassung der Wissenskompetenz konnte bei Fußballtrainern aufgezeigt werden, dass die Kenntnis von notwendigem Trainerverhalten in Spielpausen unzureichend ausgebildet ist.

AB - Das Mentale Training im Sinne der planmäßig wiederholten Vorstellung einer motorischen Fertigkeit ist ein zentraler Gegenstand der sportwissenschaftlichen Forschung und eine wichtige Trainingsergänzung in der Sportpraxis. Für das bessere Verständnis der Trainingswirkung wird in diesem Beitrag vorgeschlagen, Mentales Training als Simulation zu verstehen. Der Begriff der Simulation bezieht sich, (1) auf die neuronale Ebene, also der Aktivierung von motorischen Arealen während der Bewegungsvorstellung, (2) auf die motorische Kontrollebene und die Umsetzung durch interne Modelle, wobei das Vorwärtsmodell als Emulator gesehen wird sowie (3) auf die Wirkungsweise des Mentalen Trainings mit einer Fokussierung auf die Korrektur der zentralen Prozesse anhand der simulierten Rückmeldungen des Emulators. Der Ansatz der Simulation lässt sich auf andere mentale Zustände, die motorische Handlungen abbilden, übertragen und bietet somit einen generellen Erklärungsansatz für motorische Leistungsveränderungen, die durch kognitive Prozesse verursacht werden. Zudem deckt der Simulationsbegriff die flexible und phänomenale Sicht des mental Trainierenden ab. Der Ansatz der Simulation bietet auf verschiedenen Ebenen Vorhersagen, die zukünftige Untersuchungen in diesem Bereich anregen sollten.

AB - Die zunehmende Relevanz sportpsychologischer Arbeit im Spitzensport macht die Entwicklung sportartspezifischer Betreuungskonzepte notwendig. Der vorliegende Artikel zeigt überblicksartig die Entwicklung einer sportpsychologischen Expertise für die vier Fachsparten (Wasserspringen/Schwimmen/Synchronschwimmen/Wasserball) des Deutschen Schwimm-Verbandes e. V. (DSV). Auf Wunsch des Sportdirektors des DSV, Herrn Buschkow, und durch die finanzielle Unterstützung des Bundesinstituts für Sportwissenschaft (BISp) konnte die Umsetzung der Expertise realisiert werden. Trainer und Sportpsychologen wurden in Einzelinterviews zu den für die Leistung wichtigsten psychologischen und sozialen Fertigkeiten der Athleten befragt. Eine qualitative Inhaltsanalyse diente als Basis für die Erstellung eines spezifischen psychologischen Anforderungsprofils für die jeweilige Fachsparte. Die Profile bilden die empfehlende Grundlage für spezifische sportpsychologische Betreuungskonzepte, welche speziell für jede einzelne Fachsparte anwendbar sind.

AB - Background To ensure the highest technical performance, speed, safety, excellent control and to improve competitive performance, a successful regulation of competitive anxiety is necessary. Therefore, it seems crucial to identify factors influencing competitive anxiety of adolescent athletes. Research suggests that people reporting high quality of life are more capable to cope with stressful and challenging situations than others. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of quality of life, the involvement of parents in sports career and coach's leadership behaviour on competitive anxiety in Winter Youth Olympic Games participants. Methods During the first Winter Youth Olympic Games 2012 in Innsbruck/Austria, 662 (316 women) participants completed questionnaires and single items to assess quality of life, coach's leadership behaviour, parental involvement in sports career and competitive anxiety. Results Multiple regression analysis revealed positive influences of high quality of life and useful coach instruction on competitive anxiety. Conclusions The relationship between quality of life, coach behaviour and competitive anxiety in young elite athletes competing at the first Winter Youth Olympic Games should be considered in long-term programmes for reducing competitive stress.

AB - Die positive Wirkung von Sport- und Bewegungstherapie in der Behandlung depressiver Erkrankungen konnte in zahlreichen Interventionsstudien nachgewiesen werden und gehört heute zum stationären Behandlungsalltag. Dennoch wurde bisher nur unzureichend untersucht, mit welcher sportlichen Betätigung über welchen Zeitraum hinweg welche Effekte erzielt werden können. Der vorliegende Beitrag verfolgt das Ziel, Handlungsempfehlungen für die (Sport-)Therapie mit depressiven Patienten zu formulieren. Dabei wird davon ausgegangen, dass insbesondere durch die Integration von Psychotherapie und Sport- und Bewegungstherapie positive Effekte erzielt werden können. Diese Empfehlungen beinhalten (1) das spontane Initiieren von Handlungen und die Förderung kognitiver Flexibilität, (2) das Ermöglichen und Entkatastrophisieren von Fehlern, (3) die Verbesserung der Körperwahrnehmung, (4) die systematische Steigerung körperlicher Aktivität und (5) die Modifikation des Umgangs mit Belastungen. Auf Basis dieser Empfehlungen gelte es, Sport- und Bewegungstherapieprogramme zu entwickeln und zu evaluieren, die theoriegeleitet eine multiprofessionelle Depressionstherapie ermöglichen.

AB - Aus der Sicht unterschiedlicher Disziplinen (Sportwissenschaft, Psychologie, Psychotherapie, Pädagogik, Medizin) wird die Problematik von Burn-out und Drop-out im Nachwuchsleistungssport fokussiert. Den Hintergrund bilden Erkenntnisse aus internationalen empirischen Studien, nach denen bis zu 90 % der Mädchen und 75 % der Jungen innerhalb von fünf Jahren nach Beginn des Trainings aus dem Leistungssport ausscheiden. Als Gründe dafür werden die zu frühe Spezialisierung, fehlende Regeneration, Verletzungen, Konflikte zwischen Schule und Sport sowie ein Mangel an Motivation angeführt. Es wird ein lösungsorientierter Einblick in die Problematik gegeben. - Inhalt: (1) Thomas Wörz: Nachwuchsleistungssport im Mittelpunkt: Warum steigen jugendliche Leistungssportler aus? Oder wie "Drop-outs" verhindert und Talente optimal gefördert werden können. (2) Gudrun Fröhner: Belastbarkeitssicherung im Nachwuchsleistungssport.
