LID - 10.1111/sms.12410 [doi] AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the relations among situational       motivational climate, dispositional approach and avoidance achievement goals,       perceived sport ability, and enjoyment in Finnish male junior ice hockey players.       The sample comprised 265 junior B-level male players with a mean age of 17.03       years (SD = 0.63). Players filled questionnaires tapping their perceptions of       coach motivational climate, achievement goals, perceived sport ability, and       enjoyment. For the statistical analysis, players were divided into high and low       perceived sport ability groups. Multigroup structural equation modeling (SEM)       revealed an indirect path from task-involving motivational climate via       task-approach goal to enjoyment. Additionally, SEM demonstrated four other direct       associations, which existed in both perceived ability groups: from ego-involving        motivational climate to ego-approach and ego-avoidance goals; from ego-approach       goal to ego-avoidance goal; and from task-avoidance goal to ego-avoidance goal.       Additionally, in the high perceived sport ability group, there was an association       from task-involving motivational climate to enjoyment. The results of this study        reveal that motivational climate emphasizing effort, personal development and       improvement, and achievement goal mastering tasks are significant elements of       enjoyment in junior ice hockey.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare morning and evening time-trial       performance, RPE and mood state of trained swimmers, taking into account       chronotype, habitual training time-of-day and PERIOD3 (PER3) variable number       tandem repeat genotype. METHODS: Twenty-six swimmers (18 males, age: 32.6 +/- 5.7       years) swam 200 m time trials (TT) at 06h30 and 18h30 in a randomised order.       RESULTS: There was no difference between morning and evening performance when the       swimmers were considered as a single group (06h30: 158.8 +/- 22.7 s, 18h30: 158.5       +/- 22.0 s, p = 0.611). However, grouping swimmers by chronotype and habitual       training time-of-day allowed us to detect significant diurnal variation in       performance, such that morning-type swimmers and those who habitually train in       the morning were faster in the 06h30 TT (p = 0.036 and p = 0.011, respectively).        This was accompanied by lower ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) scores       post-warm-up, higher vigour and lower fatigues scores prior to the 06h30 TT in       morning-type swimmers or those who trained in the morning. Similarly, neither       types and those who trained in the evenings had lower fatigue and higher vigour       prior to the 18h30 TT. CONCLUSIONS: It appears that both chronotype and habitual        training time-of-day need to be considered when assessing diurnal variation in       performance. From a practical point of view, athletes and coaches should be aware       of the potentially powerful effect of training time on shifting time-of-day       variation in performance.
