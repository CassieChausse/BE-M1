The sample comprised 265 junior B-level male players with a mean age of 17.03      years (SD = 0.63). Players filled questionnaires tapping their perceptions of      coach motivational climate, achievement goals, perceived sport ability, and      enjoyment. For the statistical analysis, players were divided into high and low      perceived sport ability groups. Multigroup structural equation modeling (SEM)      revealed an indirect path from task-involving motivational climate via      task-approach goal to enjoyment. Additionally, SEM demonstrated four other direct      associations, which existed in both perceived ability groups: from ego-involving       motivational climate to ego-approach and ego-avoidance goals; from ego-approach      goal to ego-avoidance goal; and from task-avoidance goal to ego-avoidance goal.      Additionally, in the high perceived sport ability group, there was an association      from task-involving motivational climate to enjoyment. The results of this study       reveal that motivational climate emphasizing effort, personal development and      improvement, and achievement goal mastering tasks are significant elements of      enjoyment in junior ice hockey.CI  - (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

METHODS: Twenty-six swimmers (18 males, age: 32.6 +/- 5.7      years) swam 200 m time trials (TT) at 06h30 and 18h30 in a randomised order.      RESULTS: There was no difference between morning and evening performance when the      swimmers were considered as a single group (06h30: 158.8 +/- 22.7 s, 18h30: 158.5      +/- 22.0 s, p = 0.611). However, grouping swimmers by chronotype and habitual      training time-of-day allowed us to detect significant diurnal variation in      performance, such that morning-type swimmers and those who habitually train in      the morning were faster in the 06h30 TT (p = 0.036 and p = 0.011, respectively).       This was accompanied by lower ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) scores      post-warm-up, higher vigour and lower fatigues scores prior to the 06h30 TT in      morning-type swimmers or those who trained in the morning. Similarly, neither      types and those who trained in the evenings had lower fatigue and higher vigour      prior to the 18h30 TT. CONCLUSIONS: It appears that both chronotype and habitual       training time-of-day need to be considered when assessing diurnal variation in      performance. From a practical point of view, athletes and coaches should be aware      of the potentially powerful effect of training time on shifting time-of-day      variation in performance.FAU - Rae, Dale EAU  - Rae DEAD  - MRC/UCT Research Unit for Exercise Science and Sports Medicine, Faculty of Health      Sciences, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa, Dale.Rae@uct.ac.za.FAU - Stephenson, Kim JAU  - Stephenson KJFAU - Roden, Laura CAU  - Roden LCLA  - ENGPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLEDEP - 20150129TA  - Eur J Appl PhysiolJT  - European journal of applied physiologyJID - 100954790EDAT- 2015/01/30 06:00MHDA- 2015/01/30 06:00CRDT- 2015/01/30 06:00PHST- 2014/07/15 [received]PHST- 2015/01/13 [accepted]PHST- 2015/01/29 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1007/s00421-015-3109-9 [doi]PST - aheadofprintSO  - Eur J Appl Physiol. 2015 Jan 29.PMID- 25617538OWN - NLMSTAT- In-Data-ReviewDA  - 20150125IS  - 1699-5198 (Electronic)IS  - 0212-1611 (Linking)VI  - 31IP  - 2DP  - 2014TI  - [Effects of branched amino acids in endurance sports: a review].PG  - 577-89LID - 10.3305/nh.2015.31.2.7852 [doi]AB  - INTRODUCTION: The report issued by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) in 2010      on nutrition and health claims, shows that there is no scientific evidence to      support supplementation with branched chain amino acids (BCAAs). The aim of this       study is to analyze the effects of consumption of BCAAs in endurance sports.      METHODS: A literature review on the current state of the effect of consumption of      dietary supplements of BCAAs. We conducted a search in the PubMed database and      snowball strategy. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Spanish / English randomized clinical      trial related to the consumption of BCAAs, leucine, valine and isoleucine in      endurance sports and its effects on muscle damage, athletic performance, central       fatigue, anabolic signals during recovery and immune system response published in      any country until May 2014. RESULTS: Out of 330 studies identified, 14 met the      inclusion criteria. The mean of subjects participating in the study was      (11.36+/-7.43). Only two studies included a group of women. The sports that we      found in the studies were: run, cycling, combining cycling and running, Olympic      distance triathlon and one study included 2 groups of athletes (Olympic distance       triathletes and runners). The effects of BCAAs and muscle damage, athletic      performance, central fatigue, anabolic signals during recovery period and immune       response were studied at different times: before, during and after training or a       combination of these. DISCUSSION: It is observed that there is a lesser degree of      pain and muscle damage, less perceived exertion and mental fatigue, greater      anabolic response in recovery period and improved immune response when      supplemented with BCAAs, notwithstanding its decision before or during physical      activity does not improve athletic performance. No consensus was found in the      dose and timing of the most effective decision, although it is more effective if       there is 2-3/1/1g relationship between leucine / isoleucine and valine amino      acids.CI  - Copyright AULA MEDICA EDICIONES 2014.

Researchers have shown that mental rotation abilities differ between populations       depending on several variables. This study uses a mental rotation task to      investigate effects of several factors on the spatial abilities of 277      volunteers. The results demonstrate that high and low imagers performed equally      well on this tasks. Athletes outperformed nonathletes regardless of their      discipline, and athletes with greater expertise outperformed those with less      experience. The results replicate the previously reported finding that men      exhibit better spatial abilities than women. However, with high amounts of      practice, the women in the current study were able to perform as well as men.FAU - Habacha, HamdiAU  - Habacha HAD  - Universitede Caen Basse-Normandie, Caen France.FAU - Molinaro, CorinneAU  - Molinaro CFAU - Dosseville, FabriceAU  - Dosseville FLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Am J PsycholJT  - The American journal of psychologyJID - 0370513SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - Athletes/*psychologyMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - Imagination/*physiologyMH  - MaleMH  - *Practice (Psychology)MH  - RotationMH  - Sex FactorsMH  - Space Perception/*physiologyMH  - Sports/physiologyMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2015/01/16 06:00MHDA- 2015/01/30 06:00CRDT- 2015/01/16 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Am J Psychol. 2014 Fall;127(3):313-23.PMID- 25567138OWN - NLMSTAT- PublisherDA  - 20150108LR  - 20150109IS  - 1466-447X (Electronic)IS  - 0264-0414 (Linking)DP  - 2015 Jan 8TI  - How should "hot" players in basketball be defended? The use of fast-and-frugal      heuristics by basketball coaches and players in response to streakiness.PG  - 1-9AB  - Abstract Previous research has shown that changes in shot difficulty may have      rendered the hot-hand effect in basketball unobservable and are potentially a      result of defensive adjustments. However, it has not been directly analysed      whether strategic changes indeed take place in response to streakiness and      whether they are effective with respect to winning games. The current work      consists of an experimental study with 18 professional coaches and 20 players      based on video sequences from National Basketball Association games, where the      shown player displayed a streaky performance in half of the sequences. While      coaches were asked to devise a defensive strategy after each viewed sequence,      players had to assume the role of the shown player and decide whether to shoot or      pass the ball. We find that coaches tended to increase the defensive pressure      significantly more often on presumably hot players and thus make use of the      hot-hand heuristic. Meanwhile, players chose to shoot more frequently in      low-pressure and streaky situations but selected "pass" regardless of the      previous performance when they faced increased defensive pressure. Assuming that       a streaky player's performance is indeed elevated during hot phases, hot-hand      behaviour can be considered adaptive in certain situations as it led hot players       to pass instead of shoot.FAU - Csapo, PeterAU  - Csapo PAD  - a Institute of Psychology , German Sport University , Cologne , Germany.FAU - Avugos, SimchaAU  - Avugos SFAU - Raab, MarkusAU  - Raab MFAU - Bar-Eli, MichaelAU  - Bar-Eli MLA  - ENGPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLEDEP - 20150108TA  - J Sports SciJT  - Journal of sports sciencesJID - 8405364OTO - NOTNLMOT  - decision-makingOT  - ecological rationalityOT  - fast and frugal heuristicsOT  - hot handOT  - sportOT  - streakEDAT- 2015/01/09 06:00MHDA- 2015/01/09 06:00CRDT- 2015/01/09 06:00AID - 10.1080/02640414.2014.999251 [doi]PST - aheadofprintSO  - J Sports Sci. 2015 Jan 8:1-9.PMID- 25558960OWN - NLMSTAT- PublisherDA  - 20150106LR  - 20150112IS  - 1543-3072 (Electronic)IS  - 1056-6716 (Linking)DP  - 2015 Jan 5TI  - Athletes' Use of Mental Skills During Sport Injury Rehabilitation.AB  - CONTEXT: Existing theoretical frameworks and empirical research support the      applicability and usefulness of integrating mental skills throughout sport injury      rehabilitation. Objective: To determine what, if any, mental skills athletes use       during injury rehabilitation, and by whom these skills were taught.      Cross-cultural differences were also examined. DESIGN: Cross-sectional design.      SETTING: United States (US) collegiate athletes from five universities and a      mixture of collegiate, professional, and recreational club athletes from the      United Kingdom (UK) and Finland were recruited for this study. PARTICIPANTS: A      total of 1283 athletes from the US, UK, and Finland, who participated in diverse       sports at varying competitive levels took part in this study. MAIN OUTCOME      MEASURES: As part of a larger study on athletes' expectations of injury      rehabilitation, participants were asked a series of open-ended and closed-ended      questions concerning their use of mental skills during injury rehabilitation.      RESULTS: Over half (64.0%) of the sample reported previous experience with      athletic training, while 27.0% indicated that they used mental skills during      injury rehabilitation. The top three mental skills reported were goal setting,      positive self-talk/positive thoughts and imagery. Of those athletes that used      mental skills, 71.6% indicated that they felt mental skills helped them to      rehabilitate faster. A greater proportion of athletes from the US (33.4%)      reported that they used mental skills during rehabilitation compared to athletes       from the UK (23.4%) and Finland (20.3%). A small portion (27.6%) of the      participants indicated that their sports medicine professional had taught them      how to use mental skills; only 3% were taught mental skills by a sport      psychologist. CONCLUSIONS: The low number of athletes who reported using mental      skills during rehabilitation is discouraging, but not surprising given research      findings that mental skills are underutilized by injured athletes in the three      countries examined. More effort should be focused on educating and training      athletes, coaches, and sports medicine professionals on the effectiveness of      mental training within the injury rehabilitation context.FAU - Arvinen-Barrow, MonnaAU  - Arvinen-Barrow MAD  - Department of Kinesiology, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI.FAU - Clement, DamienAU  - Clement DFAU - Hamson-Utley, Jordan JAU  - Hamson-Utley JJFAU - Zakrajsek, RebeccaAU  - Zakrajsek RFAU - Lee, Sae-MiAU  - Lee SMFAU - Kamphoff, CindraAU  - Kamphoff CFAU - Lintunen, TaruAU  - Lintunen TFAU - Hemmings, BrianAU  - Hemmings BFAU - Martin, ScottAU  - Martin SLA  - ENGPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLEDEP - 20150105TA  - J Sport RehabilJT  - Journal of sport rehabilitationJID - 9206500EDAT- 2015/01/07 06:00MHDA- 2015/01/07 06:00CRDT- 2015/01/07 06:00AID - 2013-0148 [pii]AID - 10-1123/jsr.2013-0148 [doi]PST - aheadofprintSO  - J Sport Rehabil. 2015 Jan 5.PMID- 25556707OWN - NLMSTAT- PublisherDA  - 20150105LR  - 20150106IS  - 1600-0838 (Electronic)IS  - 0905-7188 (Linking)DP  - 2014 Dec 30TI  - Nutritional supplement and doping use in sport: Possible underlying social      cognitive processes.LID - 10.1111/sms.12377 [doi]AB  - There is growing evidence suggesting that nutritional supplement (NS) use is      strongly associated to doping use in elite and amateur sports. However, there is       a paucity of research on the psychological processes that underlie this      association. The present study investigated the cognitive and behavioral      components of the association between NS use and doping among adolescent      sub-elite athletes. Six hundred and fifty adolescent athletes completed a      questionnaire including measures of doping intentions, attitudes, norms, and      beliefs about NS use. The results showed that NS users who did not report doping       use had significantly stronger doping intentions and more positive attitudes and       favorable beliefs toward doping use, as compared with athletes who did not use      NS. In support of the "shared mental representations" hypothesis, the present      findings show that NS use is associated with biased reasoning patterns in favor      of doping use. This mechanism may explain why some NS users decide to engage in      doping.CI  - (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

He was recovering from quadruple coronary artery      bypass grafting (CABG) and had completed several weeks of traditional cardiac      rehabilitation in his hometown, but the exercise program no longer met his needs.      He wanted help in returning both to his normal training regimen and to      powerlifting competition but was unable to attend the Dallas program in person.      An exercise physiologist with the program devised a virtual coaching model in      which the patient was sent a wrist blood pressure cuff for self-monitoring and      was advised about exercises that would not harm his healing sternum, even as the       weight loads were gradually increased. After 17 weeks of symptom-limited,      high-intensity training that was complemented by phone and e-mail support, the      patient was lifting heavier loads than he had before CABG. At a powerlifting      competition 10 months after CABG, he placed first in his age group.

Their rate of use is not documented at the time of publication. The objective of       this study was to examine the current attitudes and recommendations of Canadian      alpine ski racing coaches towards spinal protective devices. METHODS: A      convenience sample of alpine ski racing coaches across Canada were contacted in      each provincial sport governing body in the ski racing community. A ten question       online survey was attached to the initial email. Descriptive statistical analysis      was utilized. RESULTS: A total of 29 Canadian alpine ski racing coaches completed      the study survey. All participants were familiar with spinal protective devices      and 51.7% of respondents reported that they do not actively enforce spinal      protective device use with their ski racing athletes. 80% of respondents reported      that their Canadian ski racing club did not have guidelines or policies regarding      spinal protective device use. 86.2% of respondents were unaware if their      provincial sport organization had a policy regarding their use. DISCUSSION: The      majority of coaches reporting training athletes aged 10-15, which may help to      explain why only half of those surveyed enforce the use of spinal protective      devices. This group of athletes may not participate in speed events as frequently      as older athletes, where the use of spinal protective devices is more common.      CONCLUSION: The majority of Canadian Alpine ski coaches report a belief that      spinal protective device use is important, however, far fewer enforce their use,       or work in an environment with a policy requiring it. Further research is      required to determine the differences in beliefs and practice.FAU - Stainsby, BrynneAU  - Stainsby BAD  - Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College, 6100 Leslie Street, Toronto, Canada.FAU - Law, JeremyAU  - Law JAD  - Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College, 6100 Leslie Street, Toronto, Canada.FAU - Mackinnon, AmyAU  - Mackinnon AAD  - Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College, 6100 Leslie Street, Toronto, Canada.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - CanadaTA  - J Can Chiropr AssocJT  - The Journal of the Canadian Chiropractic AssociationJID - 7507184PMC - PMC4262813OID - NLM: PMC4262813OAB - Publisher: Abstract available from the publisher.OABL- freOTO - NOTNLMOT  - AlpineOT  - coachOT  - protectiveOT  - skierOT  - spinalEDAT- 2015/01/01 06:00MHDA- 2015/01/01 06:01CRDT- 2015/01/01 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Can Chiropr Assoc. 2014 Dec;58(4):428-35.PMID- 25550662OWN - NLMSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINEDA  - 20141231DCOM- 20141231LR  - 20150113IS  - 0008-3194 (Print)IS  - 0008-3194 (Linking)VI  - 58IP  - 4DP  - 2014 DecTI  - A case of early sports specialization in an adolescent athlete.PG  - 377-83AB  - Early sport specialization (ESS) refers to intense year round training in a      specific sport with the exclusion of other sports at a young age. This approach      to training is heavily debated and there are claims both in support and against      ESS. ESS is considered to be more common in the modern day youth athlete and      could be a source of overuse injuries and burnout. This case describes a 16 year       old elite level baseball pitcher who engaged in high volume, intense training at       a young age which lead to several significant throwing related injuries. The case      highlights the historical context of ESS, the potential risk and benefits as well      as the evidence for its effectiveness. It is important for health care      professionals to be informed on the topic of ESS in order to educate athletes,      parents, coaches and organizations of the potential risks and benefits.FAU - Ferguson, BradAU  - Ferguson BAD  - Division of Graduate Studies, Sports Sciences, Canadian Memorial Chiropractic      College.FAU - Stern, Paula JAU  - Stern PJAD  - Director, Graduate Studies, Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - CanadaTA  - J Can Chiropr AssocJT  - The Journal of the Canadian Chiropractic AssociationJID - 7507184PMC - PMC4262816OID - NLM: PMC4262816OAB - Publisher: Abstract available from the publisher.OABL- freOTO - NOTNLMOT  - adolescentOT  - baseballOT  - chiropracticOT  - sport specializationOT  - youthEDAT- 2015/01/01 06:00MHDA- 2015/01/01 06:01CRDT- 2015/01/01 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Can Chiropr Assoc. 2014 Dec;58(4):377-83.PMID- 25531821OWN - NLMSTAT- PublisherDA  - 20141222LR  - 20141223IS  - 1465-3966 (Electronic)IS  - 1354-8506 (Linking)DP  - 2014 Dec 22TI  - Health-related quality of life after solid organ transplantation: the role of      sport activity.PG  - 1-8AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of sport activity on      health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of solid organ transplant recipients      participating in sports competitions. A group of 168 sportive transplanted      patients (STP), a group of 97 nonsportive transplanted patients (NSTP), and a      group of 152 sportive healthy controls (SHC) were compared on the eight scales of      the SF-36 questionnaire. STP and NSTP reported significantly lower scores than      SHC on the physical functioning scale. STP did not differ from SHC in the      Role-Physical, General Health, and Vitality scales, while NSTP reported      significantly lower scores. STP obtained higher scores than NSTP and SHC on      Mental Health. Among STP, the effect of quantity of sport activity was      significant on General Health and Role Emotional, with more sport activity      associated with higher HRQoL. Organ failure and post-transplant therapies may      have negative consequences on HRQoL. Sports activities and participation in      sports competitions can reduce this impact, improving general and psychological      functioning of solid organ transplant recipients.FAU - Cicognani, ElviraAU  - Cicognani EAD  - a Department of Psychology , University of Bologna , Via Berti Pichat, 5, 40126      Bologna , Italy.FAU - Mazzoni, DavideAU  - Mazzoni DFAU - Totti, ValentinaAU  - Totti VFAU - Roi, Giulio SergioAU  - Roi GSFAU - Mosconi, GiovanniAU  - Mosconi GFAU - Nanni Costa, AlessandroAU  - Nanni Costa ALA  - ENGPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLEDEP - 20141222TA  - Psychol Health MedJT  - Psychology, health & medicineJID - 9604099OTO - NOTNLMOT  - health behaviorsOT  - judgmentOT  - quality of lifeOT  - social psychologyEDAT- 2014/12/23 06:00MHDA- 2014/12/23 06:00CRDT- 2014/12/23 06:00AID - 10.1080/13548506.2014.993404 [doi]PST - aheadofprintSO  - Psychol Health Med. 2014 Dec 22:1-8.PMID- 25520762OWN - NLMSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINEDA  - 20141218DCOM- 20141218LR  - 20141220IS  - 2008-000X (Print)IS  - 2008-000X (Linking)VI  - 5IP  - 3DP  - 2014 SepTI  - A study of sports related occurrence of traumatic orodental injuries and      associated risk factors in high school students in north India.PG  - e22766LID - 10.5812/asjsm.22766 [doi]AB  - BACKGROUND: Oral and dental injuries contribute to a major part of sports related      injuries in children. Trauma occurring in developing years disrupts normal social      functioning and brings about a major impact on quality of life due to their      cumulative effect. OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence and causes of various      sports related traumatic orodental injuries among 8 to 16 year school students      along with identifying the associated risk factors in North India. PATIENTS AND      METHODS: A cross sectional study consisting of high school students of different       organized sports teams aged 8-16 years was carried out in geographical area of      north India. The students were selected by multistage cluster sampling      methodology. 1105 students from 19 school teams (sports teams) and sports      academies participated in study through structured interview and clinical      examination in different sports situations. RESULTS: 30.3% (n = 335) of students       suffered from orodental injuries. A higher number of girls had injury (32%) than       boys (29%), though the difference was not significant. Most of the students      suffered from soft tissue injuries (48%) followed by tooth fractures (43%).      Maximum numbers of injuries were reported in high velocity (44.1%) and medium      intensity sports (46.6%) (P < 0.001) Maximum injuries occurred in basketball      (50%) and lowest in the field of badminton (6.1%) (P < 0.05). Amateurs (52%)      suffered the most from injuries as per level of coaching. Only 6% of boys and 2%       of girls used mouthguards. CONCLUSIONS: The result of the present study confirmed      that students participating in different organized sports at high school level      are at a very high risk of getting orodental injury. Hence knowledge and      education regarding prevention of traumatic injuries is of paramount importance.FAU - Singh, GundeepAU  - Singh GAD  - M. M.

This was an exploratory retrospective study      to examine if previous involvement in interscholastic sports was associated with       a greater lifetime prevalence of medical prescription opioid use, lifetime risk      for diverting prescribed opioids, and lifetime risk for nonmedical prescription      opioid use. Method: A Web-based survey was self-administered to a sample of 4,187      full-time undergraduate students at a large public university located in the      Midwest. Student demographics, involvement in interscholastic sports during high       school, lifetime medical prescription opioid use, lifetime risk for diverting      prescribed opioids, and lifetime risk for nonmedical prescription opioid use were      measured and analyzed for this study. Results: Multiple logistic regression      analyses indicated that those who participated in at least 1 interscholastic      sport during high school had greater odds for lifetime medical prescription      opioid use on multiple occasions and greater odds for being approached to divert       their prescribed opioid medications on multiple occasions when compared with      their peers who did not participate in interscholastic sports during high school.      Conclusions: The findings indicate some association between previous involvement       in interscholastic sports and prescription opioid use and misuse. These findings       further suggest that greater awareness should be instilled in parents and coaches      regarding this form of substance misuse.FAU - Veliz, PhilipAU  - Veliz PAD  - a University of Michigan.FAU - Epstein-Ngo, QuyenAU  - Epstein-Ngo QFAU - Austic, ElizabethAU  - Austic EFAU - Boyd, CarolAU  - Boyd CFAU - McCabe, Sean EstebanAU  - McCabe SELA  - ENGGR  - R01 DA024678/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 DA031160/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - T32 DA007267/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLEDEP - 20141216TA  - Res Q Exerc SportJT  - Research quarterly for exercise and sportJID - 8006373OTO - NOTNLMOT  - athleteOT  - pain killersOT  - prescription misuseOT  - young adultsEDAT- 2014/12/17 06:00MHDA- 2014/12/17 06:00CRDT- 2014/12/17 06:00AID - 10.1080/02701367.2014.983219 [doi]PST - aheadofprintSO  - Res Q Exerc Sport. 2014 Dec 16:1-7.PMID- 25511202OWN - NLMSTAT- In-Data-ReviewDA  - 20141216IS  - 0022-3980 (Print)IS  - 0022-3980 (Linking)VI  - 149IP  - 2DP  - 2015 Feb 17TI  - The sporting body: body image and eating disorder symptomatology among female      athletes from leanness focused and nonleanness focused sports.PG  - 141-60LID - 10.1080/00223980.2013.846291 [doi]AB  - ABSTRACT Female athletes experience pressure to conform to social and sporting      norms concerning body weight. This study compared general and sporting body      dissatisfaction and disordered eating symptomatology among 320 elite,      recreational, and noncompetitive female athletes aged 17 to 30 years competing in      leanness focused sports and nonleanness focused sports. Participants completed an      online questionnaire including demographic questions, the Eating Attitudes Test,       and the Figure Rating Scale. Athletes from leanness focused sports reported      higher levels of body dissatisfaction and greater disordered eating      symptomatology regardless of participation level. Elite athletes reported higher       levels of body dissatisfaction and greater disordered eating symptomatology      regardless of sport type, and differences between recreational and noncompetitive      athletes were not found. More than 60% of elite athletes from leanness focused      and nonleanness focused sports reported pressure from coaches concerning body      shape. The findings have important implications for identifying risk factors for       eating disorders among female athletes, where athletes who compete at elite level      and those who compete in leanness focused sports at any level may be at higher      risk for developing eating disorders.FAU - Kong, PeilingAU  - Kong PAD  - a Australian College of Applied Psychology.FAU - Harris, Lynne MAU  - Harris LMLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20140304PL  - United StatesTA  - J PsycholJT  - The Journal of psychologyJID - 0376332SB  - IMOTO - NOTNLMOT  - athletesOT  - body dissatisfactionOT  - body imageOT  - contextualOT  - eating disorder symptomsOT  - sportEDAT- 2014/12/17 06:00MHDA- 2014/12/17 06:00CRDT- 2014/12/17 06:00PHST- 2014/03/04 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1080/00223980.2013.846291 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Psychol. 2015 Feb 17;149(2):141-60. doi: 10.1080/00223980.2013.846291.

The      half-time practices employed by team-sports players generally include returning      to the changing rooms, temporarily relaxing from the cognitive and physical      demands of the first half, rehydration and re-fuelling strategies, addressing      injury or equipment concerns, and receiving tactical instruction and coach      feedback. However, the typically passive nature of these actions has been      associated with physiological changes that impair performance during the second      half. Both physical and cognitive performances have been found to decline in the       initial stages of subsequent exercise that follows half-time. An increased risk      of injury has also been observed during this period. Therefore, half-time      provides sports scientists and strength and conditioning coaches with an      opportunity to optimise second-half performance. An overview of strategies      thought to benefit team-sports athletes is presented; specifically, the efficacy       of heat maintenance strategies (including passive and active methods),      post-activation potentiation, hormonal priming, and modified hydro-nutritional      practices are discussed. A theoretical model of applying these strategies in a      manner that compliments current practice is also offered.FAU - Russell, MarkAU  - Russell MAD  - Department of Sport, Exercise and Rehabilitation, Health and Life Sciences,      Northumbria University, Northumberland Street, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, NE1 8ST, UK,       mark.russell@northumbria.ac.uk.FAU - West, Daniel JAU  - West DJFAU - Harper, Liam DAU  - Harper LDFAU - Cook, Christian JAU  - Cook CJFAU - Kilduff, Liam PAU  - Kilduff LPLA  - ENGPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLEDEP - 20141212TA  - Sports MedJT  - Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)JID - 8412297EDAT- 2014/12/17 06:00MHDA- 2014/12/17 06:00CRDT- 2014/12/16 06:00AID - 10.1007/s40279-014-0297-0 [doi]PST - aheadofprintSO  - Sports Med. 2014 Dec 12.PMID- 25503712OWN - NLMSTAT- PublisherDA  - 20141215LR  - 20141217IS  - 0022-4707 (Print)IS  - 0022-4707 (Linking)DP  - 2014 Dec 11TI  - Collegiate coaches' knowledge of the female athlete triad in relation to sport      type.AB  - AIM: The purpose of this study was to determine what coaches of female athletes      know about the three components of the female athlete triad with regard to type      of sport coached and the characteristics of the coach. METHODS: The sample      consisted of 309 NCAA Division I coaches of female athletes in the sports of:      sports with subjective scoring of performance (gymnastics and diving), low body      weight sports (cross country and rowing), revealing or fitted clothing      (volleyball and swimming), and other (soccer and basketball). An original,      self--report questionnaire, and a 4--point Likert scale to measure confidence in       answer was used. The variables were: knowledge, confidence, and coach's      characteristics (coach's gender, degree held, years of experience in coaching      females, continuing education participation specific to the triad and triad      components, and type of sport coached). RESULTS: Coaches of low body weight      sports scored significantly higher than both coaches of sports requiring fitted      clothing and "other" sports in the overall score. They further had significantly       more confidence in their answers than coaches of "other" sports. No significant      differences in the overall score in any of the types of sport or total values      were found regarding gender, experience, and degree. Coaches who had received      training about the triad or its components scored significantly higher than      coaches who did not receive training. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated a lack      of information among coaches and that participating in formative training can      help to reduce this problem. The results found can help in the design of      continuing education for coaches.FAU - Frideres, J EAU  - Frideres JEAD  - retired Associate Professor, Department of Health & Kinesiology, The University      of Texas Pan American, Edinburg, Texas - jefrideres@gmail.com.FAU - Mottinger, S GAU  - Mottinger SGFAU - Palao, J MAU  - Palao JMLA  - ENGPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLEDEP - 20141211TA  - J Sports Med Phys FitnessJT  - The Journal of sports medicine and physical fitnessJID - 0376337EDAT- 2014/12/17 06:00MHDA- 2014/12/17 06:00CRDT- 2014/12/16 06:00AID - R40Y9999N00A140179 [pii]PST - aheadofprintSO  - J Sports Med Phys Fitness. 2014 Dec 11.PMID- 25497367OWN - NLMSTAT- PublisherDA  - 20141215LR  - 20141217IS  - 1769-664X (Electronic)IS  - 0929-693X (Linking)DP  - 2014 Nov 15TI  - [Sports-related concussions in youths.]LID - S0929-693X(14)00513-2 [pii]LID - 10.1016/j.arcped.2014.11.004 [doi]AB  - Mild head trauma can be associated with concussion, defined as transient brain      function impairment without radiological findings. Sports-related concussion is      also reported in pediatrics (rugby, ice hockey, football, boxing, etc.).      Misdiagnosis can lead to persistent neurocognitive signs with athletic and      academic problems. Consensual tools are available, but they are not well-known by      first-line doctors, coaches, and patients or parents. Concussed players should      not be allowed to return to the field on the same day. Return to play should be      gradual over 3weeks or more. School activities may need to be modified to favor      cognitive rest. Prevention is based on risk information and knowledge transfer,      rule changes, and protective helmets, whose effectiveness is not always proven.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

METHODS:      This was a retrospective research in which existing data from the data bank of      Kashan University of Medical Sciences Trauma Research Center were employed. The      data were extracted from the main source by SPSS version 16.0. Variables such as       age, education, occupation and gender were analyzed. RESULTS: The highest      proportion of injuries was observed in students (59.4%) followed by workers      (11.8%). Upper and lower extremities were most commonly injured. The most      frequent injury was strain (35.4%), followed by sprain (27.7%). CONCLUSION: The      results of this research showed that the majority of the sports trauma occurrs in      students; therefore, they need more attention in regard to sports injuries.      Preventive measures such as informing the coaches and teachers as well as      increasing the students'awareness about the injury risk can decrease the      incidences of sports injuries.FAU - Sharif, Mohammad RezaAU  - Sharif MRAD  - Trauma Research Center, College of Medicine, Kashan University of Medical      Sciences, Kashan 87159-81158, I.R.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate awareness, understandings       and behavioural intentions of health messages promoted at sponsored community      sport and arts events. METHODS: Interview and self-administered surveys were      completed by 2259 adults attending one of 29 sport and arts events held in      Western Australia between 2008 and 2013. The surveys measured participant      awareness of the health message promoted at the event, as well as comprehension,       acceptance and behavioural intention as a result of exposure to health messages.       RESULTS: Awareness of the sponsored health message was 58% across all sponsored      events, with high levels of comprehension (74%) and acceptance (92%) among those       aware of the health message. Forming behavioural intentions was significantly      related to the type of sponsored message promoted at the event, being female and       over 40 years of age. Messages about sun protection and promoting mental health      were the most likely to result in behavioural intention. CONCLUSIONS: Health      message sponsorship, at least within a comprehensive sponsorship program, appears      to remain an effective health promotion strategy for generating awareness and      behavioural intention among people attending sport and arts events. Remaining      relevant within a modern sponsorship environment appears closely aligned to      selecting health messages that promote behavioural action relevant to the      sponsored event that are also supported by broader health promotion campaigns.FAU - Rosenberg, MichaelAU  - Rosenberg MAD  - Health Promotion Evaluation Unit, School of Sport Science, Exercise and Health,      University of Western Australia, (M408) 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley 6009, Perth,      Western Australia.

While there is some evidence indicating lower sports      participation for children with developmental delays (DD) as compared with their       typically developing (TD) peers, little is known as to the predictors of this      differential participation. Given the increased risk of physical and mental      health difficulties for children with DD, understanding more about this disparity      is important. We examined sports participation in elementary school-aged children      with or without DD and examined child and family predictors of three indices of      sports participation: number of sports and highest relational sport at ages 6 and      8, and consistent sports from 6 to 8. Children with TD were significantly higher       on all three indicators. Mother and child factors related significantly to sports      participation indices. The number of sports related positively to mother      education and positive perceptions and negatively to mother employment.      Relational sports were higher in boys, children with higher social skills, and      lower behavior problems. In regression analyses at child age 8 that included      these other variables, delay status (DD or TD) did not have a significant effect.      Perspectives on varying influences on sports participation and implications for      intervention are discussed.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Theory-based sport promotion interventions are one possible way to      increase the amount of individuals who engage in sport. OBJECTIVES: The primary      objective of this study was to examine the profiles of three different sport      participation groups with respect to demographic, injury, and Health Action      Process Approach (HAPA) constructs. METHODS: ANOVAs and Chi-square tests were      used to determine group differences on demographic and disability-related      constructs. A MANCOVA was conducted to determine differences between three sport       participation groups (non-intenders, intenders, and actors) with age, years      post-injury, mode of mobility, and sex included as covariates. RESULTS: A cohort       of 201 individuals was recruited; 56 (27.9%) were non-intenders, 21 (10.4%) were       intenders, and 124 (61.7%) were actors. The MANCOVA revealed significant      differences between groups on the HAPA constructs, F(22,370) = 9.02, p < .0001,      Pillai's trace = .70, demonstrating that individuals with acquired physical      disabilities will rate important health behavior constructs differently based on       their sport intentions. CONCLUSION: These results provide an important framework       that adapted sport organizations can use to tailor their sport promotion      programs.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Sample 1 consisted of 506 team sport athletes [262 men      and 244 women; mean age: 22.20, standard deviation (SD) = 3.90] distributed      across 41 coaches at the two highest national levels of various sports. Athletes       completed the CBS-S and established questionnaires of coaching behaviors (LSS),      self-confidence (CSAI-2R), and coach-athlete relationship (CART-Q). An additional      sample of 39 basketball players (21 men and 18 women; mean age = 17.40, SD =      2.39) completed the CBS-S twice, approximately 4 weeks apart. Confirmatory factor      analysis showed an acceptable model fit for the seven-factor version of the      CBS-S, although two items of the negative personal rapport subscale displayed      insufficient factor loadings. Correlations between the subscales of the CBS-S and      established instruments were in accordance with theoretical expectations,      supporting the concurrent validity. Cronbach's alpha (> 0.82) for all dimensions       provided support for the reliability of the CBS-S, and test-retest correlations      indicated moderate stability over time. Cultural differences in the assessment of      coaching behaviors and the usability of the CBS-S by coaches for self-reflection       and development are discussed.CI  - (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Nevertheless,      research is still sparse with respect to the model's impact on student learning      outcomes. The goal of the present review is to therefore scrutinize what is      currently known regarding students' learning during their participation in Sport       Education. This research spans a variety of studies, cross various countries,      school grades, the sports studied, as well as the methods applied and dimensions       of student learning analyzed. While research on the impact of Sport Education on       students' learning, as well as teachers' and students' perceptions about student       learning has shown students' improvements during the participation in Sport      Education seasons, there is still considerable variance in these results. For      example, some studies report superior learning opportunities to boys and higher      skill-level students while other studies have identified superior learning      opportunities for girls and lower skill-level students. These inconsistent      results can be explained by factors not considered in the Sport Education      research, such as the effect of time on students' learning and the control of the      teaching-learning process within Sport Education units. In this review directions      for future research and practice are also described. Future research should      define, implement, and evaluate protocols for student-coaches' preparation in      order to understand the influence of this issue on students' learning as well as       consider the implementation of hybrid approaches. Moreover, future studies should      consider the interaction of gender and skill level and a retention test in the      analysis of students' learning improvements in order to obtain a more realist and      complete portrait of the impact of Sport Education. Finally, in order to reach an      entirely understanding of the teaching-learning process, it is necessary to use      research designs that attend to the complexity of this process. Key PointsDespite      research regarding has showed students' improvements during the participation in       Sport Education seasons, it remains somewhat equivocal.The studies included in      this review show students' improvements on skill, knowledge and tactical      development, as we as game play, during the participation in Sport Education      units.Some studies report superior learning opportunities to boys and higher      skill-level students while other studies exposed superior learning opportunities       to girls and lower skill-level students.The effect of time on students' learning       and the control of the teaching-learning process within Sport Education units can      explain these equivocal results.Future research is encouraged to consider the      implementation of protocols for student-coaches' preparation, hybrid models, a      retention test, the interaction of gender and skill level, and use research      designs that attend to the complexity of the teaching-learning process.FAU - Araujo, RuiAU  - Araujo RAD  - Centre of Research, Education, Innovation and Intervention in Sport, CIFI D,      Faculty of Sport, University of Porto , Porto, Portugal.FAU - Mesquita, IsabelAU  - Mesquita IAD  - Centre of Research, Education, Innovation and Intervention in Sport, CIFI D,      Faculty of Sport, University of Porto , Porto, Portugal.FAU - Hastie, Peter AAU  - Hastie PAAD  - Kinesiology, Auburn University , Auburn, USA.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20141201PL  - TurkeyTA  - J Sports Sci MedJT  - Journal of sports science & medicineJID - 101174629PMC - PMC4234955OID - NLM: PMC4234955OTO - NOTNLMOT  - AssessmentOT  - genderOT  - instructional modelsOT  - physical educationOT  - skill levelOT  - studentsEDAT- 2014/12/02 06:00MHDA- 2014/12/02 06:01CRDT- 2014/12/02 06:00PHST- 2014/12 [ecollection]PHST- 2014/05/17 [received]PHST- 2014/08/15 [accepted]PHST- 2014/12/01 [epublish]PST - epublishSO  - J Sports Sci Med. 2014 Dec 1;13(4):846-58. eCollection 2014 Dec.PMID- 25427788OWN - NLMSTAT- PublisherDA  - 20141127LR  - 20141128IS  - 1741-2684 (Electronic)IS  - 1471-3012 (Linking)DP  - 2014 Nov 26TI  - Football and dementia: A qualitative investigation of a community based sports      group for men with early onset dementia.LID - 1471301214560239 [pii]AB  - This study investigates the impact of a weekly group providing sport and physical      activities for men with early onset dementia established by Notts County Football      in the Community (NCFC). There were three aims: to investigate the effect of      early onset dementia on individuals with the condition and their carers; to      examine the perceptions of current levels of service provision for people with      early onset dementia; and to analyse the impact of the group. Men with dementia      (n = 5) attending the sessions, their carers (n = 5), NCFC coaching staff (n = 5)      and people organizing/facilitating the sessions (n = 5) were interviewed.      Semi-structured interviews explored the participants' experiences of dementia,      their opinions on current service provisions and on the sessions. Data were      analysed using thematic analysis. Four main themes were found: loss related to      the condition of dementia and its impact on relationships ('Loss'); lack of      age-appropriate services for people with early onset dementia ('Lack of      Resources'); enjoyment and positive anticipation related to the group for all      involved ('Enjoyment and Anticipation'); and 'the Notts County Effect' which      attributed the success of the sessions to the strong brand of the football club,       and to personalized service in a "dementia-free" environment. The NCFC sessions      provided a safe low-cost intervention with positive effects upon quality of life       for both people with early onset dementia, their carers and the staff involved.      This suggests that the service may be valuable to a wider range of people living       in different areas.CI  - (c) The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions:      sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.FAU - Carone, LauraAU  - Carone LAD  - School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, UK.FAU - Tischler, VictoriaAU  - Tischler VAD  - University of the Arts London - London College of Fashion, UK.FAU - Dening, TomAU  - Dening TAD  - Centre for Dementia, Institute of Mental Health, University of Nottingham, UK      tom.dening@nottingham.ac.uk.LA  - ENGPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLEDEP - 20141126TA  - Dementia (London)JT  - Dementia (London, England)JID - 101128698OTO - NOTNLMOT  - dementiaOT  - early onset dementiaOT  - footballOT  - menOT  - quality of lifeOT  - sporting activitiesEDAT- 2014/11/28 06:00MHDA- 2014/11/28 06:00CRDT- 2014/11/28 06:00AID - 1471301214560239 [pii]AID - 10.1177/1471301214560239 [doi]PST - aheadofprintSO  - Dementia (London). 2014 Nov 26. pii: 1471301214560239.PMID- 25416514OWN - NLMSTAT- In-ProcessDA  - 20141204LR  - 20141207IS  - 1471-2474 (Electronic)IS  - 1471-2474 (Linking)VI  - 15DP  - 2014TI  - Movement coaching: study protocol of a randomized controlled trial evaluating      effects on physical activity and participation in low back pain patients.PG  - 391LID - 10.1186/1471-2474-15-391 [doi]AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic Low Back Pain is a complex syndrome with multifactorial      bio-psycho-social etiology and interdependences. Thereby, physical activity seems      to play an essential role regarding the prevention and rehabilitation of LBP. In       consequence, physical activity and exercise therapy is an integral part of      musculoskeletal rehabilitation in LBP. However, adherence to self-directed      exercise and implementing a health-enhancing physical activity in daily routine      after rehabilitation is a common problem for patients and only a few patients      integrate health-enhancing physical activity and/or sport activities in their      lifestyle. The present paper describes a comprehensive multilevel approach      combining face-to-face intervention, telephone and internet aftercare (Movement      Coaching). Aim of the trial presented in this study protocol is to evaluate      effectiveness of Movement Coaching compared to a control intervention.      METHODS/DESIGN: The study is a prospective, single-blinded, monocenter randomized      controlled trial (RCT) with three measuring points: T1=start of inpatient      rehabilitation; T2=six months follow-up; T3=twelve months follow-up. In total,      412 patients were recruited. The intervention involves small-group face-to-face      contact during inpatient rehabilitation (two times, week 2 & 3) and telephone      aftercare (week 8 & week 12 after rehabilitation) as well as internet-based      aftercare (web 2.0 platform; available until six months after rehabilitation).      Primary outcome is physical activity, assessed by GPAQ questionnaire. The final      data collection is expected by April 2015. DISCUSSION: Due to the burden of      physical inactivity, there is a need to develop, evaluate and disseminate      approaches that are effective in promoting physical activity and especially      promoting the maintenance of physical activity in relevant target groups.      Considering the high prevalence and socioeconomic impact of low back pain and its      multifactorial etiology, low back pain patients seem to be a relevant target      group for physical activity promotion. A multilevel approach to bridge the      interface of (inpatient) rehabilitation and self-directed physical activity will       help to target group-specific PA promotion.

The study utilised a      thematic analysis approach to investigate the decision-making practices of a      sample of high-level adventure sports coaches over a series of sessions. Results       revealed that, in order to make judgements and decisions in practice, expert      coaches employ a range of practical and pedagogic management strategies to create      and opportunistically use time for decision-making. These approaches include span      of control and time management strategies to facilitate the decision-making      process regarding risk management, venue selection, aims, objectives, session      content, and differentiation of the coaching process. The implication for      coaches, coach education, and accreditation is the recognition and training of      the approaches that "create time" for the judgements in practice, namely      "creating space to think". The paper concludes by offering a template for a more       expertise-focused progression in adventure sports coaching.FAU - Collins, LoelAU  - Collins LAD  - a Institute of Coaching and Performance , University of Central Lancashire ,      Preston , UK.FAU - Collins, DaveAU  - Collins DLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20141114PL  - EnglandTA  - J Sports SciJT  - Journal of sports sciencesJID - 8405364SB  - IMOTO - NOTNLMOT  - adventure sportOT  - coachingOT  - decision-makingOT  - individualisationOT  - judgementEDAT- 2014/11/15 06:00MHDA- 2014/11/15 06:00CRDT- 2014/11/15 06:00PHST- 2014/11/14 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1080/02640414.2014.953980 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Sci. 2015;33(6):622-33. doi: 10.1080/02640414.2014.953980.

The      aim of this study was to compare generic (light--based) and sport--specific (live      opponent) reactive agility tests in court--based team sport athletes. METHODS:      Twelve semi--professional male basketball players (age: 25.9 +/- 6.7 yr; stature:      188.9 +/- 7.9 cm; body mass: 97.4 +/- 16.1 kg; predicted maximal oxygen uptake:      49.5 +/- 5.3 mLkg--1min--1) completed multiple trials of a Reactive Agility Test       containing light--based (RAT--Light) and opponent--based stimuli (RAT--Opponent).      Multiple outcome measures were collected during the RAT--Light (agility time and       total time) and RAT--Opponent (decision time and total time). RESULTS: Mean      performance times during the RAT--Light (2.233 +/- 0.224 s) were significantly (P      < 0.001) slower than during the RAT--Opponent (1.726 +/- 0.178 s). Further, a      small relationship was observed between RAT--Light agility time and RAT--Opponent      decision time (r10 = 0.20), while a trivial relationship was apparent between      total performance times across tests (r10 = 0.02). Low commonality was observed      between comparable measures across tests (R2 = 0--4%). CONCLUSION: Reactive      agility tests containing light--based and live opponent stimuli appear to measure      different qualities in court--based team sport athletes. Court--based team sport       coaches and conditioning professionals should not use generic and sport--specific      reactive agility tests interchangeably during athlete assessments.FAU - Scanlan, A TAU  - Scanlan ATAD  - Human Exercise and Training Laboratory, Central Queensland University,      Rockhampton,Australia - a.scanlan@cqu.edu.au.FAU - Wen, NAU  - Wen NFAU - Kidcaff, A PAU  - Kidcaff APFAU - Berkelmans, D MAU  - Berkelmans DMFAU - Tucker, P SAU  - Tucker PSFAU - Dalbo, V JAU  - Dalbo VJLA  - ENGPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLEDEP - 20141112TA  - J Sports Med Phys FitnessJT  - The Journal of sports medicine and physical fitnessJID - 0376337EDAT- 2014/11/13 06:00MHDA- 2014/11/13 06:00CRDT- 2014/11/13 06:00AID - R40Y9999N00A140161 [pii]PST - aheadofprintSO  - J Sports Med Phys Fitness. 2014 Nov 12.PMID- 25386951OWN - NLMSTAT- PublisherDA  - 20141111LR  - 20141112IS  - 1543-2742 (Electronic)IS  - 1526-484X (Linking)DP  - 2014 Nov 10TI  - Evaluation of Sports Nutrition Knowledge and Recommendations Among High School      Coaches.AB  - The objectives of this study were to evaluate high school coaches' knowledge in      sports nutrition and the nutritional practices they recommend to their athletes.       Forty-seven high school coaches in "leanness" and "non-leanness" sports from the       greater region of Quebec (women = 44.7 %) completed a questionnaire on      nutritional knowledge and practices. "Leanness sports" were defined as sports      where leanness or/and low bodyweight were considered important (e.g.      cheerleading, swimming and gymnastics), and "non-leanness sports" were defined as      sports where these factors are less important (e.g. football). Participants      obtained a total mean score of 68.4 % for the nutrition knowledge part of the      questionnaire. More specifically, less than 30 % of the coaches could answer      correctly some general nutrition questions regarding carbohydrates and lipids. No      significant difference in nutrition knowledge was observed between coaches from      "leanness" and "non-leanness" sports or between men and women. Respondents with a      university education scored higher than the others (73.3 % vs. 63.3 %, p < 0.05).      Coaches who participated in coaching certification also obtained better results      than those without a coaching certification. The most popular source of      information about nutrition used by coaches was the Internet at 55 %. The two      most popular nutrition practices that coaches recommended in order to improve      athlete performance were hydration and consumption of protein-rich foods.      Recommendation for nutritional supplements use was extremely rare and was      suggested only by football coaches, a non-leanness sport. Findings from this      study indicate that coaches need sports nutrition education and specific      training.FAU - Couture, StevenAU  - Couture SAD  - Department of Physical Education, Laval University, Quebec, QC, Canada.FAU - Lamarche, BenoitAU  - Lamarche BFAU - Morissette, ElianeAU  - Morissette EFAU - Provencher, VeroniqueAU  - Provencher VFAU - Valois, PierreAU  - Valois PFAU - Goulet, ClaudeAU  - Goulet CFAU - Drapeau, VickyAU  - Drapeau VLA  - ENGPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLEDEP - 20141110TA  - Int J Sport Nutr Exerc MetabJT  - International journal of sport nutrition and exercise metabolismJID - 100939812EDAT- 2014/11/12 06:00MHDA- 2014/11/12 06:00CRDT- 2014/11/12 06:00AID - 2014-0195 [pii]AID - 10.1123/ijsnem.2014-0195 [doi]PST - aheadofprintSO  - Int J Sport Nutr Exerc Metab. 2014 Nov 10.PMID- 25385557OWN - NLMSTAT- In-Data-ReviewDA  - 20150129IS  - 1466-447X (Electronic)IS  - 0264-0414 (Linking)VI  - 33IP  - 6DP  - 2015TI  - Cohesion, team mental models, and collective efficacy: towards an integrated      framework of team dynamics in sport.PG  - 641-53LID - 10.1080/02640414.2014.957714 [doi]AB  - Abstract A nomological network on team dynamics in sports consisting of a      multiframework perspective is introduced and tested. The aim was to explore the      interrelationship among cohesion, team mental models (TMMs), collective efficacy       (CE) and perceived performance potential (PPP). Three hundred and forty      college-aged soccer players representing 17 different teams (8 female and 9 male)      participated in the study. They responded to surveys on team cohesion, TMMs, CE      and PPP. Results are congruent with the theoretical conceptualisation of a      parsimonious view of team dynamics in sports. Specifically, cohesion was found to      be an exogenous variable predicting both TMMs and CE beliefs. TMMs and CE were      correlated and predicted PPP, which in turn accounted for 59% of the variance of       objective performance scores as measured by teams' season record. From a      theoretical standpoint, findings resulted in a parsimonious view of team      dynamics, which may represent an initial step towards clarifying the      epistemological roots and nomological network of various team-level properties.      From an applied standpoint, results suggest that team expertise starts with the      establishment of team cohesion. Following the establishment of cohesiveness,      teammates are able to advance team-related schemas and a collective sense of      confidence.

A total of 350 coach-athlete dyads completed a self-report instrument      that assessed personality traits, as well as perceptions of relationship quality       and satisfaction with training. Results revealed that: (a) actor effects (i.e.,      actor's personality will predict his or her own perceptions of relationship      quality) of personality traits, namely, conscientiousness, extroversion, and      neuroticism, on both coaches' and athletes' perceptions of relationship quality      and (b) partner effects (an actor's own personality will predict his or her      partner's perceptions of relationship quality) of only athletes' personality,      namely, conscientiousness, extroversion, and neuroticism, on their coaches'      perceptions of relationship quality. The findings suggested that each      relationship member's personality trait contributed independently to relationship      quality, and both actor and partner effects of the relationship quality on      satisfaction with training were found to be significant.

Since the 1960s, expertise researchers have      made considerable progress in understanding the cognitive and neural mechanisms      that underlie such exceptional performance. Whereas the first modern studies of      expertise were conducted in relatively formal knowledge domains such as chess,      more recent investigations have explored elite performance in dynamic      perceptual-motor activities such as sport. Unfortunately, although these studies       have led to the identification of certain domain-free generalizations about      expert-novice differences, they shed little light on an important issue: namely,       experts' metacognitive activities or their insights into, and regulation of,      their own mental processes. In an effort to rectify this oversight, the present      paper argues that metacognitive processes and inferences play an important if      neglected role in expertise. In particular, we suggest that metacognition      (including such processes as "meta-attention," "meta-imagery" and "meta-memory,"       as well as social aspects of this construct) provides a window on the genesis of       expert performance. Following a critique of the standard empirical approach to      expertise, we explore some research on "metacognition" and "metacognitive      inference" among experts in sport. After that, we provide a brief evaluation of      the relationship between psychological skills training and metacognition and      comment on the measurement of metacognitive processes. Finally, we summarize our       conclusions and outline some potentially new directions for research on      metacognition in action.FAU - MacIntyre, Tadhg EAU  - MacIntyre TEAD  - Department of Physical Education and Sport Sciences, University of Limerick,      Limerick Ireland.FAU - Igou, Eric RAU  - Igou ERAD  - Department of Psychology, University of Limerick, Limerick Ireland.FAU - Campbell, Mark JAU  - Campbell MJAD  - Department of Physical Education and Sport Sciences, University of Limerick,      Limerick Ireland.FAU - Moran, Aidan PAU  - Moran APAD  - School of Psychology, University College Dublin, Dublin Ireland.FAU - Matthews, JamesAU  - Matthews JAD  - School of Public Health, Physiotherapy and Population Science, University College      Dublin, Dublin Ireland.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20141016PL  - SwitzerlandTA  - Front PsycholJT  - Frontiers in psychologyJID - 101550902PMC - PMC4199257OID - NLM: PMC4199257OTO - NOTNLMOT  - cognitionOT  - cognitive neuroscienceOT  - expertiseOT  - metacognitionOT  - motor cognitionOT  - social cognitionOT  - sportOT  - sport psychologyEDAT- 2014/11/02 06:00MHDA- 2014/11/02 06:01CRDT- 2014/11/01 06:00PHST- 2014 [ecollection]PHST- 2014/06/19 [received]PHST- 2014/09/24 [accepted]PHST- 2014/10/16 [epublish]AID - 10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01155 [doi]PST - epublishSO  - Front Psychol. 2014 Oct 16;5:1155. doi: 10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01155. eCollection      2014.PMID- 25356612OWN - NLMSTAT- In-ProcessDA  - 20141031IS  - 1543-2904 (Electronic)IS  - 0895-2779 (Linking)VI  - 36IP  - 5DP  - 2014 OctTI  - "I think they believe in me": the predictive effects of teammate- and      classmate-focused relation-inferred self-efficacy in sport and physical activity       settings.PG  - 486-505LID - 10.1123/jsep.2014-0070 [doi]AB  - Despite the prevalence of group-/team-based enactment within sport and physical      activity settings, to this point the study of relation-inferred self-efficacy      (RISE) has been focused upon estimations regarding a single target individual      (e.g., one's coach). Accordingly, researchers have not yet considered whether      individuals may also form RISE estimations regarding the extent to which the      others in their group/team as a whole are confident in their ability. We applied       structural equation modeling analyses with cross-sectional and prospective data      collected from members of interdependent sport teams (Studies 1 and 2) and      undergraduate physical activity classes (Studies 3 and 4), with the purpose of      exploring these group-focused RISE inferences. Analyses showed that group-focused      RISE perceptions (a) predicted individuals' confidence in their own ability, (b)       were empirically distinct from conceptually related constructs, and (c) directly       and/or indirectly predicted a range of downstream outcomes over and above the      effects of other efficacy perceptions. Taken together, these findings provide      preliminary evidence that individuals' group-focused RISE appraisals may be      important to consider when investigating the network of efficacy perceptions that      develops in group-based physical activity contexts.FAU - Jackson, BenAU  - Jackson BAD  - School of Sport Science, Exercise and Health, University of Western Australia,      Crawley, Perth, WA, Australia.FAU - Gucciardi, Daniel FAU  - Gucciardi DFFAU - Lonsdale, ChrisAU  - Lonsdale CFAU - Whipp, Peter RAU  - Whipp PRFAU - Dimmock, James AAU  - Dimmock JALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - United StatesTA  - J Sport Exerc PsycholJT  - Journal of sport & exercise psychologyJID - 8809258SB  - IMEDAT- 2014/10/31 06:00MHDA- 2014/10/31 06:00CRDT- 2014/10/31 06:00AID - 10.1123/jsep.2014-0070 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sport Exerc Psychol. 2014 Oct;36(5):486-505. doi: 10.1123/jsep.2014-0070.PMID- 25356609OWN - NLMSTAT- In-ProcessDA  - 20141031IS  - 1543-2904 (Electronic)IS  - 0895-2779 (Linking)VI  - 36IP  - 5DP  - 2014 OctTI  - Goal striving and well-being in sport: the role of contextual and personal      motivation.PG  - 446-59LID - 10.1123/jsep.2013-0261 [doi]AB  - This investigation sought to clarify mixed results in the literature exploring      coach behaviors, basic psychological needs, goal motivation, and well- and      ill-being. Regional-level team sport athletes (N = 241) completed questionnaires       on the aforementioned variables at the beginning of the season. A subsample (n =       70) provided saliva samples to assess physical ill-being. At the end of the      season, athletes (n = 98) reported their goal motivation and attainment.      Structural equation modeling demonstrated that coach behaviors were related to      needs satisfaction and thwarting, which were related to autonomous and controlled      goal motives respectively. Autonomous motives were related to well- and      ill-being; controlled motives were only related to ill-being. Over time, only      end-of-season autonomous goal motives were related to goal attainment. The      findings provide an insight into how coaches can facilitate optimum goal striving      and well-being in their athletes.FAU - Healy, Laura CAU  - Healy LCAD  - Physical Education and Sport Studies Department, Newman University, Bartley      Green, Birmingham, UK.FAU - Ntoumanis, NikosAU  - Ntoumanis NFAU - Veldhuijzen van Zanten, Jet JAU  - Veldhuijzen van Zanten JJFAU - Paine, NicolaAU  - Paine NLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - United StatesTA  - J Sport Exerc PsycholJT  - Journal of sport & exercise psychologyJID - 8809258SB  - IMEDAT- 2014/10/31 06:00MHDA- 2014/10/31 06:00CRDT- 2014/10/31 06:00AID - 10.1123/jsep.2013-0261 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sport Exerc Psychol. 2014 Oct;36(5):446-59. doi: 10.1123/jsep.2013-0261.PMID- 25336600OWN - NLMSTAT- In-ProcessDA  - 20150101IS  - 1552-3365 (Electronic)IS  - 0363-5465 (Linking)VI  - 43IP  - 1DP  - 2015 JanTI  - Concussion management in United States college sports: compliance with National      Collegiate Athletic Association concussion policy and areas for improvement.PG  - 47-56LID - 10.1177/0363546514553090 [doi]AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2010, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) adopted       its Concussion Policy and Legislation, which applies to more than 450,000      collegiate athletes annually. To date, there has been no examination of      school-level compliance with the NCAA Concussion Policy. PURPOSE: To examine      whether stakeholders at NCAA schools report that their school has a concussion      management plan and whether existing plans are consistent with the NCAA policy.      Also examined were stakeholders' perceptions regarding concussion management at      their institution and possible areas for improvement. STUDY DESIGN:      Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Surveys were sent by e-mail      to coaches, sports medicine clinicians, and compliance administrators at all 1066      NCAA member institutions. Surveys asked population-specific questions about      institutional concussion management. Individuals (N=2880) from 907 unique schools      participated in this survey. RESULTS: Most respondents (n=2607; 92.7%) indicated       their school had a concussion management plan. Most schools had all (82.1%) or      some (15.2%) respondents indicate a concussion management plan was present. When       asked to indicate all individuals who could have final responsibility for      returning athletes to play after a concussion, 83.4% selected team doctor, 72.8%       athletic trainer, 31.0% specialist physician, 6.8% coach, and 6.6% athlete. Most       respondents (76.1%) indicated that their institution had a process for annual      athlete concussion education; 91.2% required athletes to acknowledge their      responsibility to report concussion symptoms. Nearly all respondents (98.8%)      thought their school's concussion management plan protected athletes "well" or      "very well." Top categories suggested for improvement included better coach      education (39.7%), increasing sports medicine staffing (37.2%), and better      athlete education (35.2%). CONCLUSION: Although a large majority of respondents      indicated that their school has a concussion management plan, improvement is      needed. Compliance with specified components (eg, annual athlete education) lags       behind the presence of the plan itself, and stakeholders had suggestions for      areas in which improvements are needed.

"Dangerous style of play" was delineated as       one of these factors, most likely based on clinical lore. These modifying factors      were retained in a more recent Concussion in Sport Group statement. To date,      there has been no concerted effort to support or refute the inclusion of this      constellation of behaviors as a modifying factor in sports-related concussion.      This article reviews and summarizes the limited evidence related to a dangerous      style of play in sports-related concussion, offers a preliminary assessment of      its relevance as a modifying factor, and provides additional information on other      aspects of player, coach, and governing body behavior and their potential      effect(s) on reducing concussive injuries.FAU - Diamond, Alex BAU  - Diamond ABAD  - Assistant Professor, Departments of Orthopaedic Surgery and Rehabilitation and      Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, and Program for Injury      Prevention in Youth Sports, Vanderbilt Sports Concussion Center, Nashville, TN.      alex.b.diamond@vanderbilt.edu.FAU - Solomon, Gary SAU  - Solomon GSLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Phys SportsmedJT  - The Physician and sportsmedicineJID - 0427461SB  - IMMH  - Athletic Injuries/*prevention & control/*psychologyMH  - Brain Concussion/*prevention & control/*psychologyMH  - *Competitive BehaviorMH  - Football/injuriesMH  - Hockey/injuriesMH  - HumansMH  - *Risk-TakingEDAT- 2014/10/09 06:00MHDA- 2015/01/15 06:00CRDT- 2014/10/09 06:00AID - 10.3810/psm.2014.09.2071 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Phys Sportsmed. 2014 Sep;42(3):20-5. doi: 10.3810/psm.2014.09.2071.PMID- 25283157OWN - NLMSTAT- In-ProcessDA  - 20141011IS  - 1471-2458 (Electronic)IS  - 1471-2458 (Linking)VI  - 14DP  - 2014TI  - Linking secondary school physical education with community sport and recreation      for girls: a process evaluation.PG  - 1039LID - 10.1186/1471-2458-14-1039 [doi]AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to undertake a process evaluation to      examine the reach, adoption and implementation of a school-community linked      physical activity (PA) program for girls aged 12 - 15 years (School Years 7 - 9)       using the RE-AIM framework. METHODS: Various approaches were used to assess      'reach', 'adoption' and implementation: (a) a school environment survey of      intervention schools (n = 6); (b) teacher feedback regarding the professional      development component (91.1% response rate) and lesson implementation (60.8%      response rate); and (c) post-intervention focus group interviews with physical      education (PE) teachers (n = 29), students (n = 125), coaches (n = 13) and      instructors (n = 8) regarding program experiences. RESULTS: Reach and Adoption:      Seven schools (n = 1491 Year 7-9 female student enrolment; 70% adoption rate),      five tennis clubs, eight football clubs and five leisure centres participated in       the program during 2011. IMPLEMENTATION: Program design and professional      development opportunities (training, resource manual and opportunities to work      with coaches and instructors during PE classes) supported implementation and      student engagement in PA. However, there was a lack of individual and      organisational readiness to adopt program principles. For some deliverers there      were deeply embedded ideologies that were not aligned with the Game Sense      teaching approach upon which the program was based. Further, cognitive components      of the program such as self-management were not widely adopted as other      components of the program tended to be prioritised. CONCLUSION: The program      design and resources supported the success of the program, however, some aspects       were not implemented as intended, which may have affected the likelihood of      achieving further positive outcomes. Barriers to program implementation were      identified and should be considered when designing school-community linked      interventions. In particular, future programs should seek to assess and adjust      for organizational readiness within the study design. For example, shared      commitment and abilities of program deliverers to implement the program needs to       be determined to support program implementation.

[Subjects and Methods] The study subjects were 445 children involved in sports      with a mean age of 12.74+/-1.03 years, a mean height of 156.56+/-10.82 cm, and a       mean weight of 45.39+/-10.29 kg; 52.8% of the study subjects were male, and 47.2%      were female. The subjects were surveyed using a questionnaire developed by the      author. [Results] The highest incidence of sport injury was in the foot-ankle      region, and the lowest incidence was in the hip-femur region. The incidences of      injuries to the neck, shoulder, elbow, hand, wrist, superior dorsal region,      waist, hip-femur region, knee, and foot-ankle regions weren't statistically      significant. [Conclusion] This study established that children participating in      competitive sports are at risk of injury. The causes of injuries were examined to      propose preventive measures to minimize their occurrence and severity. It should       not be overlooked that injuries can occur more easily among children because      their musculoskeletal system is not fully developed, and coaches should be      educated in the appropriate training intensities for children.FAU - Atay, EmrahAU  - Atay EAD  - School of Physical Education and Sport, Mehmet Akif Ersoy University, Turkey.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20140917PL  - JapanTA  - J Phys Ther SciJT  - Journal of physical therapy scienceJID - 9105359PMC - PMC4175256OID - NLM: PMC4175256OTO - NOTNLMOT  - ChildrenOT  - Sport injuriesEDAT- 2014/10/03 06:00MHDA- 2014/10/03 06:01CRDT- 2014/10/03 06:00PHST- 2014/01/29 [received]PHST- 2014/03/31 [accepted]PHST- 2014/09/17 [epublish]AID - 10.1589/jpts.26.1455 [doi]AID - jpts-2013-461 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - J Phys Ther Sci. 2014 Sep;26(9):1455-7. doi: 10.1589/jpts.26.1455.

METHODS:      Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was assessed with the use of the SF-36      questionnaire on a group of 118 active kidney transplant patients (AKTPs)      practicing different sports at low to moderate intensity (5+/-4 h/wk). Scores      were compared with those of 79 sedentary kidney transplant patients (SKTPs) and      with 120 active healthy control subjects (AHCs). RESULTS: AKTPs reported higher      scores than SKTPs in the SF-36 scales of Physical Functioning (P<.05), Role      Limitations due to Physical Problems (P<.05), General Health (P<.01), Vitality      (P<.05), Social Functioning (P<.05), Role Limitations due to Emotional Problems      (P<.05), and Mental Health (P<.01). AKTPs obtained higher scores than AHCs on the      Mental Health (P<.01) and Social Functioning scales (P<.01) and similar scores      (P>.05) on all the other scales. The effect of quantity of sport activity was      significant on the General Health (P<.01; eta2=0.05), and Role Physical scales      (P=.04; eta2=0.03), with higher sport activity associated with higher HRQoL. The       effect of sex was significant for Bodily Pain (P=.05; eta2=0.02), Vitality      (P=.08; eta2=0.06), Social Functioning (P=.08; eta2=0.05), and Mental Health      (P=.05; eta2=0.02), with male participants scoring higher than female      participants. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that regular sport activity      significantly improves different dimensions of HRQoL among kidney transplant      recipients. The benefits of sport activity go beyond its impact on physical      health to involve psychologic and social components of quality of life.      Spontaneous and low to moderate sport activity may play an important role after      kidney transplantation that has been largely underestimated in the literature.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Almost three thousand      student athletes from 26 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division IA,      II, III, and National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics academic      institutions in the United States met inclusion criteria for this study. We      assessed multiple variables including, gender, sport, family history of traumatic      brain injury, history of mental illness, history of migraine headache, and      baseline and postconcussion neuropsychological test results. Reported concussions      were evaluated with multiple instruments including number of symptoms and symptom      severity. Additionally, we gathered data via a questionnaire pertaining to      medical history, demographics, and sportrelated information, and blood/saliva      samples were collected for genetic analysis, and we conducted neuropsychological       testing using Headminder and ImPACT software. The goal of this paper is to share       our experiences conducting a large prospective cohort study.

Certain forms of EHRI may become life threatening if      not treated. Exertional heat stroke (EHS), characterized by a core body      temperature of >40 degrees C and mental status changes, is the most severe form      of EHRI. EHS must be treated immediately with rapid body cooling to reduce      morbidity and mortality. Many EHRI cases are preventable by following heat      acclimatization guidelines, modifying sports and exercise sessions during      conditions of high environmental heat stress, maintaining adequate hydration,      avoiding exertion in the heat when ill, and by educating sports medicine      personnel, coaches, parents, and athletes on the early recognition and prevention      of EHRI. Heat exhaustion, exercise-associated collapse, exercise-associated      muscle cramps, exercise-associated hyponatremia, and exertional rhabdomyolysis      are also described.FAU - Nichols, Andrew WAU  - Nichols AWAD  - Family Medicine and Community Health, John A.

One promising way to achieve this goal is      guiding the learner through the correct movement trajectory with the help of a      robotic device. The aim of this study was to investigate if haptic guidance can      induce long-lasting changes in the movement pattern of a complex sport-specific      motor task. For this purpose, 31 subjects were assigned to one of three groups:      EA (early angle, n=10), LA (late angle, n=11) and CON (control, n=10). EA and LA       successfully completed five training sessions, which consisted of 50 robot-guided      golf swings and 10 free swings each, whereas CON had no training. The EA group      was guided through the movement with the wrist being bent early during backswing,      whereas in the LA group it was bent late. The participants of EA and LA were not       told about this difference in the movement patterns. To assess if the      robot-guided training was successful in shaping the movement pattern, the timing       of the wrist bending during the backswing in free swings was measured before      (PRE), one day after (POST), and 7 days after (FUP) the five training sessions.      The ANOVA (timexgroupxangle) showed that during POST and FUP, the participants of      the EA group bent their wrist significantly earlier during the backswing than the      other groups. Post-hoc analyses revealed that this interaction effect was mainly       due to the differences in the wrist angle progression during the first 5 degrees       of the backswing. The robot-guided training was successful in shaping the      movement pattern, and these changes persisted even after 7 days without further      practice. This might have implications for the learning of complex motor tasks in      general, as haptic guidance might quickly provide the beginner with an internal      model of the correct movement pattern without having to direct the learner's      attention towards the key points of the correct movement pattern.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

As opposed to a focus on diagnosing or      managing concussive injuries, this article seeks to promote injury prevention      strategies.FAU - Guskiewicz, KevinAU  - Guskiewicz KAD  - *Department of Exercise and Sport Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel      Hill; double daggerMatthew Gfeller Sport-Related Traumatic Brain Injury Research       Center; section signHuman Movement Science Curriculum, University of North      Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina; paragraph signDepartments      of Neurosurgery and Neurology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee,      Wisconsin; ||Clement Zablocki Milwaukee VA Medical Center, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.FAU - Teel, ElizabethAU  - Teel EFAU - McCrea, MichaelAU  - McCrea MLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - NeurosurgeryJT  - NeurosurgeryJID - 7802914SB  - IMEDAT- 2014/09/19 06:00MHDA- 2014/09/19 06:00CRDT- 2014/09/19 06:00AID - 10.1227/NEU.0000000000000494 [doi]AID - 00006123-201410001-00011 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Neurosurgery. 2014 Oct;75 Suppl 4:S113-8. doi: 10.1227/NEU.0000000000000494.PMID- 25211801OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20140912DCOM- 20141103IS  - 1098-1861 (Print)IS  - 1098-1861 (Linking)VI  - 113IP  - 4DP  - 2014 AugTI  - A survey of certification for cardiopulmonary resuscitation in high school      athletic coaches.PG  - 144-8AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can increase survival in      instances of sudden cardiac arrest. Nationally, high school coaches are the first      responders to sudden cardiac arrest in up to one-third of high school athlete      collapses, but little is known about the status of their CPR certification. The      primary goal of this study was to assess the proportion of Wisconsin high school       coaches that are certified in CPR. METHODS: A prospective web-based survey was      developed and distributed to high school athletic directors in Wisconsin.      RESULTS: Seventy-eight percent of respondents reported that coaches are the      primary responders to a collapse. The majority of high schools do not require CPR      certification and only 50% of coaches are currently CPR certified. Athletic      directors with greater than 12 years of experience were the most likely to have      an emergency action plan in place (P= 0.004). CONCLUSION: In Wisconsin, the      proportion of coaches who act as the primary responder to a collapse is greater      than previously reported. Although the majority of coaches in Wisconsin serve as       the primary responder to an episode of sudden cardiac arrest, only about 50% are       CPR certified. Due to the severe consequences of sudden cardiac arrest, CPR      certification among coaches should be required.FAU - Harer, Matthew WAU  - Harer MWFAU - Yaeger, Jeffrey PAU  - Yaeger JPLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - WMJJT  - WMJ : official publication of the State Medical Society of WisconsinJID - 9716054SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation/*standardsMH  - *CertificationMH  - ChildMH  - HumansMH  - InternetMH  - Prospective StudiesMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - *SchoolsMH  - *SportsMH  - WisconsinEDAT- 2014/09/13 06:00MHDA- 2014/11/05 06:00CRDT- 2014/09/13 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - WMJ. 2014 Aug;113(4):144-8.PMID- 25211481OWN - NLMSTAT- In-ProcessDA  - 20140912IS  - 1543-2777 (Electronic)IS  - 0736-5829 (Linking)VI  - 31IP  - 4DP  - 2014 OctTI  - Youth sport experiences of individuals with attention deficit/hyperactivity      disorder.PG  - 343-61LID - 10.1123/apaq.2014-0142 [doi]AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore youth sport experiences of individuals      with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Participants were 6 males      (mean age=22.7 yr) with ADHD who had played 3 or more seasons in team sports      during adolescence. Following interpretive phenomenological analysis methodology,      each participant completed 2 semistructured interviews. Findings showed that      symptoms of ADHD hampered participants' experiences and led to negative      interpersonal and performance-related consequences. On the other hand,      participants reported social and stress/energy-release benefits arising from      their experiences in sport. Their experiences were therefore complex, and some      findings relating to social interactions appeared contradictory (e.g., negative      interpersonal experiences vs. social benefits). Supportive coaches, understanding      teammates, and personal coping strategies were key factors that enabled      participants to realize benefits and, to some degree, mitigate negative      consequences associated with their participation in sport.FAU - Lee, HomanAU  - Lee HAD  - Faculty of Physical Education & Recreation, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB,       Canada.FAU - Causgrove Dunn, JaniceAU  - Causgrove Dunn JFAU - Holt, Nicholas LAU  - Holt NLLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Adapt Phys Activ QJT  - Adapted physical activity quarterly : APAQJID - 8701671SB  - IMEDAT- 2014/09/12 06:00MHDA- 2014/09/12 06:00CRDT- 2014/09/12 06:00AID - 10.1123/apaq.2014-0142 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Adapt Phys Activ Q. 2014 Oct;31(4):343-61. doi: 10.1123/apaq.2014-0142.PMID- 25210408OWN - NLMSTAT- PublisherDA  - 20140911IS  - 1041-3200 (Print)IS  - 1041-3200 (Linking)VI  - 26IP  - 4DP  - 2014 Oct 2TI  - Becoming a Coach in Developmental Adaptive Sailing: A Lifelong Learning      Perspective.PG  - 441-456AB  - Life-story methodology and innovative methods were used to explore the process of      becoming a developmental adaptive sailing coach. Jarvis's (2009) lifelong      learning theory framed the thematic analysis. The findings revealed that the      coach, Jenny, was exposed from a young age to collaborative environments. Social       interactions with others such as mentors, colleagues, and athletes made major      contributions to her coaching knowledge. As Jenny was exposed to a mixture of      challenges and learning situations, she advanced from recreational para-swimming       instructor to developmental adaptive sailing coach. The conclusions inform future      research in disability sport coaching, coach education, and applied sport      psychology.FAU - Duarte, TiagoAU  - Duarte TAD  - University of Ottawa.FAU - Culver, Diane MAU  - Culver DMAD  - University of Ottawa.LA  - ENGPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLEDEP - 20140808TA  - J Appl Sport PsycholJT  - Journal of applied sport psychologyJID - 9012267PMC - PMC4151822EDAT- 2014/09/12 06:00MHDA- 2014/09/12 06:00CRDT- 2014/09/12 06:00PHST- 2013/11/18 [received]PHST- 2014/04/30 [accepted]PHST- 2014/08/08 [epublish]AID - 10.1080/10413200.2014.920935 [doi]AID - 920935 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - J Appl Sport Psychol. 2014 Oct 2;26(4):441-456.

Through consideration of exemplar      shortcomings, the limitations of competency-based systems are presented as      failing to cater for the complexity of decision making and the need for proactive      experimentation essential to effective practice. To provide a better fit with the      challenges of the various disciplines in their work with performers, an      alternative approach is presented which focuses on the promotion, evaluation and       elaboration of expertise. Such an approach resonates with important      characteristics of professions, whilst also providing for the essential 'shades      of grey' inherent in work with human participants. Key differences between the      approaches are considered through exemplars of evaluation processes. The      expertise-focused method, although inherently more complex, is seen as offering a      less ambiguous and more positive route, both through more accurate representation      of essential professional competence and through facilitation of future growth in      proficiency and evolution of expertise in practice. Examples from the literature       are also presented, offering further support for the practicalities of this      approach.FAU - Collins, DaveAU  - Collins DAD  - Institute of Coaching and Performance, University of Central Lancashire, Preston,      Lancashire, PR1 2HE, UK, DJCollins@uclan.ac.uk.FAU - Burke, VeronicaAU  - Burke VFAU - Martindale, AmandaAU  - Martindale AFAU - Cruickshank, AndrewAU  - Cruickshank ALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - New ZealandTA  - Sports MedJT  - Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)JID - 8412297SB  - IMEDAT- 2014/09/12 06:00MHDA- 2014/09/12 06:00CRDT- 2014/09/12 06:00AID - 10.1007/s40279-014-0251-1 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Sports Med. 2015 Jan;45(1):1-7. doi: 10.1007/s40279-014-0251-1.PMID- 25202842OWN - NLMSTAT- PublisherDA  - 20140909IS  - 1530-0315 (Electronic)IS  - 0195-9131 (Linking)DP  - 2014 Sep 8TI  - Coaches' Knowledge and Management of Eating Disorders: A Randomized Controlled      Trial.AB  - PURPOSE: It has been suggested that programs regarding early identification and      prevention of eating disorders (ED) among athletes is unlikely to succeed without      their coaches' endorsement and participation. Therefore, we developed a 1-yr      intervention aiming to prevent the development of ED among adolescent elite      athletes by targeting athletes and their coaches. The separate part of the      intervention targeting the coaches was designed to provide knowledge and      strategies regarding healthy nutrition, eating behavior, and ED (symptoms,      identification, management and prevention). In this trial, we examined the effect      of the educational program on the coaches' knowledge and management index in      three content areas (nutrition, weight-regulation, and ED). We also examined      their subjective evaluation of their ED knowledge. METHODS: All Norwegian Elite      Sport High Schools were included (intervention group (n=9) and control group      (n=7)). Seventy-six coaches employed at and coaching first-year student athletes       at the different schools were followed 3-school years (2008-2011). At pretest and      posttest (9-months after intervention), they completed a questionnaire regarding       nutrition, weight-regulation, and ED. RESULTS: Intervention coaches had higher      knowledge index scores than control coaches for weight-regulation (6.2+/-1.7 vs.       4.8+/-1.3, p<0.001), ED (including recognition and management) (19.3+/-4.4 vs.      16.5+/-5.0, p=0.004), and total knowledge (weight-regulation, ED, and nutrition)       (35.0+/-7.2 vs. 31.6+/-8.0, p=0.021) at posttest. Moreover, the coaches      likelihood of describing knowledge of ED as 'somewhat good' or better was 7 times      higher for intervention- than control coaches at posttest (OR=7.1, 95% CI 2.2 -      23.2, p=0.001). CONCLUSION: Intervention coaches had higher index scores on total      knowledge, weight-regulation, and ED (including recognition and management) than       control coaches. The intervention also was successful in producing effects on the      coaches' subjective evaluation of their ED knowledge.FAU - Martinsen, MarianneAU  - Martinsen MAD  - 1Oslo Sports Trauma Research Center, Department of Sports Medicine, Norwegian      School of Sport Sciences, Oslo, Norway, 2The Victory Program at McCallum Place,      St. Louis, MO; 3Department of Sports Medicine, Norwegian School of Sport      Sciences, Oslo, Norway.FAU - Sherman, Roberta TAU  - Sherman RTFAU - Thompson, Ron AAU  - Thompson RAFAU - Sundgot-Borgen, JorunnAU  - Sundgot-Borgen JLA  - ENGPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLEDEP - 20140908TA  - Med Sci Sports ExercJT  - Medicine and science in sports and exerciseJID - 8005433EDAT- 2014/09/10 06:00MHDA- 2014/09/10 06:00CRDT- 2014/09/10 06:00AID - 10.1249/MSS.0000000000000489 [doi]PST - aheadofprintSO  - Med Sci Sports Exerc. 2014 Sep 8.PMID- 25189187OWN - NLMSTAT- PublisherDA  - 20140905IS  - 1536-7290 (Electronic)IS  - 1536-7290 (Linking)DP  - 2014 Sep 5TI  - Elite athletes' attitudes towards the use of placebo-induced performance      enhancement in sports.PG  - 1-7AB  - Abstract While an increasing number of research is devoted to the understanding      of placebo effects in sports, athletes' experiences with and attitudes towards      the use of placebo for performance enhancement remain poorly understood. In this       study, 79 elite athletes from different sports were surveyed on five issues      related to placebo use in sports. Results showed that 47% of the athletes have      experienced placebo effects in the past. A majority of the athletes (82%) thought      that placebos could affect their sports performances. A wider use of placebos in       sport settings was endorsed more by those who have experienced placebo effects in      the past than those who did not (P = .005). Regardless of past experience with      placebo, more than half of the athletes (53%) would accept an unknown but      legitimate substance from the coach, and 67% of them would not mind a      placebo-linked deception if that was effective. These findings confirm that most       elite athletes believe in the power of placebos in enhancing sports performance,       and those having a positive past experience exhibit slightly more favourable      attitudes in contrast to those without such experiences.FAU - Berdi, MarkAU  - Berdi MAD  - a Faculty of Education and Psychology , Institute for Health Promotion and Sport       Sciences , Eotvos Lorand University , Budapest , Hungary.FAU - Koteles, FerencAU  - Koteles FFAU - Hevesi, KrisztinaAU  - Hevesi KFAU - Bardos, GyorgyAU  - Bardos GFAU - Szabo, AttilaAU  - Szabo ALA  - ENGPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLEDEP - 20140905TA  - Eur J Sport SciJT  - European journal of sport scienceJID - 101146739OTO - NOTNLMOT  - CoachingOT  - competitionOT  - dopingOT  - ethicsOT  - performanceEDAT- 2014/09/06 06:00MHDA- 2014/09/06 06:00CRDT- 2014/09/06 06:00AID - 10.1080/17461391.2014.955126 [doi]PST - aheadofprintSO  - Eur J Sport Sci. 2014 Sep 5:1-7.PMID- 25185469OWN - NLMSTAT- PublisherDA  - 20140904LR  - 20150218IS  - 1528-1140 (Electronic)IS  - 0003-4932 (Linking)DP  - 2014 Sep 1TI  - A Randomized Controlled Study to Evaluate the Role of Video-Based Coaching in      Training Laparoscopic Skills.AB  - OBJECTIVE:: This study evaluates whether video-based coaching can enhance      laparoscopic surgical skills performance. BACKGROUND:: Many professions utilize      coaching to improve performance. The sports industry employs video analysis to      maximize improvement from every performance. METHODS:: Laparoscopic novices were       baseline tested and then trained on a validated virtual reality (VR) laparoscopic      cholecystectomy (LC) curriculum. After competence, subjects were randomized on a       1:1 ratio and each performed 5 VRLCs. After each LC, intervention group subjects       received video-based coaching by a surgeon, utilizing an adaptation of the GROW      (Goals, Reality, Options, Wrap-up) coaching model. Control subjects viewed online      surgical lectures. All subjects then performed 2 porcine LCs. Performance was      assessed by blinded video review using validated global rating scales. RESULTS::       Twenty subjects were recruited. No significant differences were observed between       groups in baseline performance and in VRLC1. For each subsequent repetition,      intervention subjects significantly outperformed controls on all global rating      scales. Interventions outperformed controls in porcine LC1 [Global Operative      Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills: (20.5 vs 15.5; P = 0.011), Objective      Structured Assessment of Technical Skills: (21.5vs 14.5; P = 0.001), and      Operative Performance Rating System: (26 vs 19.5; P = 0.001)] and porcine LC2      [Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills: (28 vs 17.5; P = 0.005),      Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills: (30 vs 16.5; P < 0.001), and      Operative Performance Rating System: (36 vs 21; P = 0.004)]. Intervention      subjects took significantly longer than controls in porcine LC1 (2920 vs 2004      seconds; P = 0.009) and LC2 (2297 vs 1683; P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS:: Despite      equivalent exposure to practical laparoscopic skills training, video-based      coaching enhanced the quality of laparoscopic surgical performance on both VR and      porcine LCs, although at the expense of increased time. Video-based coaching is a      feasible method of maximizing performance enhancement from every clinical      exposure.FAU - Singh, PritamAU  - Singh PAD  - *Division of Surgery, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London,       St. Mary's Hospital, London, United Kingdom daggerPerelman School of Medicine,      University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.

While      coaches can potentially influence athletes' PA levels, what has not been explored      is the question; do coaches perceive themselves as influential on PA for girls in      OYS? Participants were 30 coaches of girls OYS teams aged 9-17 years in the      Greater Sydney Metropolitan Area, Australia. Participants took part in a      semi-structured interview that lasted approximately 30 minutes. They responded to      questions regarding their perceived role as coaches, their perceptions of      themselves as role models for PA, their views on their athletes' current PA      levels, their opinions on improving their athletes' PA levels, and their      perceived challenges as coaches in OYS. Many coaches considered themselves role      models for PA due to their own involvement in organised sports. Coaches felt that      they were conscious of girls' PA levels during training and could accurately      gauge how active girls were. Coaches perceived their training sessions to provide      sufficient PA and thus, did not feel the need to try to increase PA during      training. Many coaches were cautious about conducting training sessions where the      PA intensity was high for prolonged periods because they believed that it could      potentially result in dropout from OYS. Coaches' perceived time commitment to      OYS, variability of skill/experience amongst girls, and poor parental support as       major challenges they experienced in OYS. This study provided a unique insight      from the perspective of coaches in OYS. Most coaches felt that they had the      potential to influence PA for girls in OYS; however, coaches may underestimate or      not fully realise the impact they can have on the girls they coach. Future      research should focus on educating coaches to capitalise on the opportunity they       have to promote PA through OYS.FAU - Guagliano, Justin MAU  - Guagliano JMAD  - School of Science and Health, University of Western Sydney, Sydney, Australia.FAU - Lonsdale, ChrisAU  - Lonsdale CAD  - Institute for Positive Psychology and Education, Australian Catholic University,       Sydney, Australia.FAU - Rosenkranz, Richard RAU  - Rosenkranz RRAD  - School of Science and Health, University of Western Sydney, Sydney, Australia;      Department of Human Nutrition, Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas, United      States of America.FAU - Kolt, Gregory SAU  - Kolt GSAD  - School of Science and Health, University of Western Sydney, Sydney, Australia.FAU - George, Emma SAU  - George ESAD  - School of Science and Health, University of Western Sydney, Sydney, Australia.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20140903PL  - United StatesTA  - PLoS OneJT  - PloS oneJID - 101285081SB  - IMPMC - PMC4153558OID - NLM: PMC4153558EDAT- 2014/09/04 06:00MHDA- 2014/09/04 06:00CRDT- 2014/09/04 06:00PHST- 2014 [ecollection]PHST- 2014/05/01 [received]PHST- 2014/07/29 [accepted]PHST- 2014/09/03 [epublish]AID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0105960 [doi]AID - PONE-D-14-19541 [pii]PST - epublishSO  - PLoS One. 2014 Sep 3;9(9):e105960. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0105960. eCollection      2014.PMID- 25177193OWN - NLMSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINEDA  - 20140901DCOM- 20140901LR  - 20140903IS  - 1303-2968 (Electronic)IS  - 1303-2968 (Linking)VI  - 13IP  - 3DP  - 2014 SepTI  - Sport Psychology Service Provision: Preferences for Consultant Characteristics      and Mode of Delivery among Elite Malaysian Athletes.PG  - 638-44AB  - Factors relevant to the working alliance between athletes and sport psychology      consultants were investigated in a sample of elite Malaysian athletes (n = 217).       The athletes represented a variety of team and individual sports, and they      provided information about the perceived importance of seven consultant      characteristics/behaviors as well as seven program delivery options. At a      full-sample level, general preferences were expressed for consultants to lead a      physically active lifestyle, regularly attend training sessions and competitions,      and have prior experience as an athlete or coach. General preferences were also      expressed for program content to be determined by the coach or consultant, and      for regular, small doses of mental skills training to be delivered in a      face-to-face context throughout the year. At a sub-group level, team sport      athletes had stronger preferences than individual sport athletes for program      delivery on a group/team basis, while individual sport athletes had stronger      preferences than team sport athletes for having a role in determining program      content. Findings are discussed in relation to dominant value themes within      Malaysian society and the reinforcement of these themes within specific sport      subcultures. Key pointsConsultant characteristics and program delivery methods      have an impact on the effectiveness of sport psychology services.Preferred      consultant characteristics and preferred methods of delivery may be affected by      cultural and subcultural values.Elite Malaysian athletes prefer consultants to      lead a physically active lifestyle; to regularly attend training/competition; and      to have prior experience as an athlete or coach.Elite Malaysian athletes also      prefer that the coach or consultant determine program content, and that mental      skills training take place in a face-to-face context throughout the year.FAU - Ponnusamy, VellapandianAU  - Ponnusamy VAD  - University of Western Australia, School of Sport Science, Exercise and Health ,      Crawley, Western Australia ; National Sports Institute of Malaysia, National      Sports Complex , Bukit Jalil, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.FAU - Grove, J RobertAU  - Grove JRAD  - University of Western Australia, School of Sport Science, Exercise and Health ,      Crawley, Western Australia.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20140901PL  - TurkeyTA  - J Sports Sci MedJT  - Journal of sports science & medicineJID - 101174629PMC - PMC4126303OID - NLM: PMC4126303OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Elite athletesOT  - cultural influencesOT  - mental skills trainingOT  - sport psychologyEDAT- 2014/09/02 06:00MHDA- 2014/09/02 06:01CRDT- 2014/09/02 06:00PHST- 2014/09 [ecollection]PHST- 2014/02/11 [received]PHST- 2014/05/30 [accepted]PHST- 2014/09/01 [epublish]PST - epublishSO  - J Sports Sci Med. 2014 Sep 1;13(3):638-44. eCollection 2014 Sep.PMID- 25147220OWN - NLMSTAT- In-ProcessDA  - 20140917IS  - 1049-7323 (Print)IS  - 1049-7323 (Linking)VI  - 24IP  - 10DP  - 2014 OctTI  - Narrative transformation among military personnel on an adventurous training and       sport course.PG  - 1440-50LID - 10.1177/1049732314548596 [doi]AB  - In the wake of recent wars, some military personnel face considerable physical      and mental health problems. In this article I explore the effects of an adapted      sport and inclusive adventurous training course for military personnel who have      experienced physical injury and/or psychological trauma. Using a dialogical      narrative approach, I analyzed stories shared by six soldiers during the course      to explore the effects of involvement. Participation in the course seemed to      facilitate a narrative transformation or opening corresponding to a broadening      identity and sense of self. Story plots progressed from a failing monological      narrative, through a chaos narrative, toward a dialogical quest narrative      prioritizing immersion in an intense present, a developing self, and a relational      orientation. On the basis of narrative theory, I suggest this transformation      holds positive consequences for the health and well-being of military personnel      who have experienced injury and/or trauma.CI  - (c) The Author(s) 2014.FAU - Carless, DavidAU  - Carless DAD  - Leeds Metropolitan University, Leeds, United Kingdom d.carless@leedsmet.ac.uk.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20140821PL  - United StatesTA  - Qual Health ResJT  - Qualitative health researchJID - 9202144SB  - TOTO - NOTNLMOT  - exercise / physical activityOT  - health and well-beingOT  - mental health and illnessOT  - narrative inquiryOT  - psychosocial issuesOT  - stories / storytellingOT  - traumaOT  - war, victims ofEDAT- 2014/08/26 06:00MHDA- 2014/08/26 06:00CRDT- 2014/08/23 06:00PHST- 2014/08/21 [aheadofprint]AID - 1049732314548596 [pii]AID - 10.1177/1049732314548596 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Qual Health Res. 2014 Oct;24(10):1440-50. doi: 10.1177/1049732314548596.

The questionnaire      submitted to the taekwondo coaches contained 16 items about dental trauma      prevention and management. The questionnaires were filled in by 131 taekwondo      coaches; 28 females and 103 males. Descriptive statistics was used to describe      and analyze the obtained data. The coaches were familiar with dental injuries in       high percentage: 41 (31.3%) have observed dental injury and 36 (27.5%) have      experienced a dental injury themselves. Eight of them had tooth avulsion,      fourteen crown fracture, and eight had tooth luxation. About half of all      interviewed coaches 68 (52.7%) were aware of the possibility of replanting      avulsed teeth. Twenty six (19.8%) were familiar with the tooth rescue kit. Only      99 out of 131 coaches (75.6%) have used a mouthguard. The obtained results show      low knowledge about possibilities for prevention of dental trauma. Insufficient      use of mouthguards in this contact sport requires more attention of dentists and       coaches education about dental trauma prevention.FAU - Vidovic, DinaAU  - Vidovic DFAU - Gorseta, KristinaAU  - Gorseta KFAU - Bursac, DanijelAU  - Bursac DFAU - Glavina, DomagojAU  - Glavina DFAU - Skrinjaric, TomislavAU  - Skrinjaric TLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - CroatiaTA  - Coll AntropolJT  - Collegium antropologicumJID - 8003354SB  - IMMH  - HumansMH  - *Martial ArtsMH  - Tooth Injuries/*prevention & control/*therapyEDAT- 2014/08/26 06:00MHDA- 2014/09/16 06:00CRDT- 2014/08/23 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Coll Antropol. 2014 Jun;38(2):681-4.PMID- 25141563OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20140821DCOM- 20140923IS  - 1660-9379 (Print)IS  - 1660-9379 (Linking)VI  - 10IP  - 437DP  - 2014 Jul 16TI  - [Sport: practiced from birth?].PG  - 1438-44AB  - Physical activity in children is on the decline, leaving room for sedentary      behaviour. Children are mentally over stimulated through the use of screens, but       their physical condition is diminishing. The benefits of physical activity in      adults are well known. Although paediatric literature is less abundant, the      benefits of regular physical activity in young children are real and extend into       adulthood. The promotion of physical activity can be made by any responsible      adult in a child's entourage. It means clarifying the confusion between physical       activity and sport, evaluating the balance between the physical and sedentary      behaviour of the children and their families and establishing with them the      possible necessary changes.

Yet, most parents have not been formally      educated on head injuries. The purpose of this article is to share the findings      of a study conducted with 235 parents that identified their knowledge, attitudes,      and perceptions of sports-related head injuries in school-age students. The study      found that 51% of respondents were unaware that head trauma was more serious in      children, 80% were uninformed as to whether the school district had a policy on      sports-related head injuries, 44% did not know if there were medical guidelines      for return to play, and 35% did not know that repeated head trauma could cause      dementia. Results of this research implore school nurses to improve patient and      parental education when they care for and monitor students with head injuries.FAU - LaBond, VirginiaAU  - LaBond VFAU - Barber, Kimberly RAU  - Barber KRFAU - Golden, Ina JAU  - Golden IJLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - NASN Sch NurseJT  - NASN school nurse (Print)JID - 101528330SB  - NMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - *Athletic Injuries/nursing/prevention & control/psychologyMH  - ChildMH  - *Craniocerebral Trauma/nursing/prevention & control/psychologyMH  - FemaleMH  - *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, PracticeMH  - Health SurveysMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Parents/*psychologyMH  - School Nursing/*methodsEDAT- 2014/08/22 06:00MHDA- 2014/09/24 06:00CRDT- 2014/08/22 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - NASN Sch Nurse. 2014 Jul;29(4):194-9.PMID- 25140822OWN - NLMSTAT- In-ProcessDA  - 20140821IS  - 1932-6203 (Electronic)IS  - 1932-6203 (Linking)VI  - 9IP  - 8DP  - 2014TI  - Nonlinear pedagogy: an effective approach to cater for individual differences in       learning a sports skill.PG  - e104744LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0104744 [doi]AB  - Learning a sports skill is a complex process in which practitioners are      challenged to cater for individual differences. The main purpose of this study      was to explore the effectiveness of a Nonlinear Pedagogy approach for learning a       sports skill. Twenty-four 10-year-old females participated in a 4-week      intervention involving either a Nonlinear Pedagogy (i.e.,manipulation of task      constraints including equipment and rules) or a Linear Pedagogy (i.e.,      prescriptive, repetitive drills) approach to learn a tennis forehand stroke.      Performance accuracy scores, movement criterion scores and kinematic data were      measured during pre-intervention, post-intervention and retention tests. While      both groups showed improvements in performance accuracy scores over time, the      Nonlinear Pedagogy group displayed a greater number of movement clusters at      post-test indicating the presence of degeneracy (i.e., many ways to achieve the      same outcome). The results suggest that degeneracy is effective for learning a      sports skill facilitated by a Nonlinear Pedagogy approach. These findings      challenge the common misconception that there must be only one ideal movement      solution for a task and thus have implications for coaches and educators when      designing instructions for skill acquisition.FAU - Lee, Miriam Chang YiAU  - Lee MCAD  - Physical Education and Sports Science, National Institute of Education, Nanyang      Technological University, Singapore, Singapore.FAU - Chow, Jia YiAU  - Chow JYAD  - Physical Education and Sports Science, National Institute of Education, Nanyang      Technological University, Singapore, Singapore.FAU - Komar, JohnAU  - Komar JAD  - CETAPS, Faculty of Sports Sciences, University of Rouen, Rouen, France.FAU - Tan, Clara Wee KeatAU  - Tan CWAD  - Physical Education and Sports Science, National Institute of Education, Nanyang      Technological University, Singapore, Singapore.FAU - Button, ChrisAU  - Button CAD  - School of Physical Education, Sport and Exercise Sciences, University of Otago,      Dunedin, New Zealand.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20140820PL  - United StatesTA  - PLoS OneJT  - PloS oneJID - 101285081SB  - IMPMC - PMC4139301OID - NLM: PMC4139301EDAT- 2014/08/21 06:00MHDA- 2014/08/21 06:00CRDT- 2014/08/21 06:00PHST- 2014 [ecollection]PHST- 2014/04/07 [received]PHST- 2014/07/16 [accepted]PHST- 2014/08/20 [epublish]AID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0104744 [doi]AID - PONE-D-14-15437 [pii]PST - epublishSO  - PLoS One. 2014 Aug 20;9(8):e104744. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0104744.      eCollection 2014.PMID- 25123599OWN - NLMSTAT- PublisherDA  - 20140815IS  - 1600-0838 (Electronic)IS  - 0905-7188 (Linking)DP  - 2014 Aug 15TI  - A team fares well with a fair coach: Predictors of social loafing in interactive       female sport teams.LID - 10.1111/sms.12303 [doi]AB  - The present research aimed to develop and test a theoretical model that links      players' perceived justice of the coach to a more optimal motivational climate,      which in turn increases players' team identification and cohesion, and results in      lower levels of social loafing in female sport teams. Belgian elite female      basketball, volleyball, and football players (study 1; N = 259; Mage = 22.6) and       Norwegian world-class female handball players (study 2; N = 110; Mage = 22.8)      completed questionnaires assessing players' perceived justice (distributive and      procedural), motivational climate, team identification, team cohesion (task and      social), and social loafing (perceived and self-reported). In both studies,      confirmatory and exploratory path analyses indicated that perceived justice was      positively related to a mastery climate (P < 0.05) and negatively to a      performance climate (P < 0.05). In turn, a mastery climate was linked to      increased levels of team identification (P < 0.05) and task cohesion (P < 0.05).       Consequently, players' perceived and self-reported social loafing decreased (P <       0.05). The findings of both independent studies demonstrated the impact of      coaches' fairness, and consequently, the motivational climate created by the      coach on the optimal functioning of female sport teams.CI  - (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The aim of this study was to compare the measured-HRmax      with three prediction equations (Fox-HRmax = 220-age and Tanaka-HRmax =      208-0.7xage and Nikolaidis-HRmax = 223-1.44xage) in young team sport athletes.      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Athletes of soccer, futsal, basketball and water polo,      classified into three age groups (u-12, 9-12 years, n = 50; u-15, 12-15 years, n       = 40; u-18, 15-18 years, n = 57), all members of competitive clubs, voluntarily      performed a graded exercise field test (20 m shuttle run endurance test) to      assess HRmax. RESULTS: Fox-HRmax and Nikolaidis-HRmax overestimated      measured-HRmax, while Tanaka-HRmax underestimated it (P < 0.001). However, this      trend was not consistent when examining each group separately; measured-HRmax was      similar with Tanaka-HRmax in u-12 and u-15, while it was similar with      Nikolaidis-HRmax in u-18. CONCLUSION: The results of this study failed to      validate two widely used and one recently developed prediction equations in a      large sample of young athletes, indicating the need for specific equation in      different age groups. Therefore, coaches and fitness trainers should prefer      Tanaka-HRmax when desiring to avoid overtraining, while Fox-HRmax and      Nikolaidis-HRmax should be their choice in order to ensure adequate exercise      intensity.FAU - Nikolaidis, Pantelis TheoAU  - Nikolaidis PTAD  - Department of Physical and Cultural Education, Hellenic Army Academy, Athens,      Greece ; Exercise Physiology Laboratory, Nikaia, Greece.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - NigeriaTA  - Niger Med JJT  - Nigerian medical journal : journal of the Nigeria Medical AssociationJID - 0315137PMC - PMC4124545OID - NLM: PMC4124545OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Age groupsOT  - athletesOT  - cardiac rateOT  - graded exercise testOT  - prediction equationsEDAT- 2014/08/13 06:00MHDA- 2014/08/13 06:01CRDT- 2014/08/13 06:00AID - 10.4103/0300-1652.137192 [doi]AID - NMJ-55-314 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Niger Med J. 2014 Jul;55(4):314-20. doi: 10.4103/0300-1652.137192.PMID- 25105087OWN - NLMSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINEDA  - 20140808DCOM- 20140808LR  - 20140814IS  - 2193-1801 (Electronic)VI  - 3DP  - 2014TI  - Building successful student-athlete coach relationships: examining coaching      practices and commitment to the coach.PG  - 383LID - 10.1186/2193-1801-3-383 [doi]AB  - In this study we utilized the concept of commitment to explain the impact of      coaching practices on student-athlete's behaviour. We examined the impact of      commitment to the coach on the coaching outcome of in-role behaviour, and the      influence of coaching practices, of information sharing, training, and      encouraging teamwork, on the formation of relationships. We adopted measures from      the organizational behaviour literature and surveyed student-athletes at two      universities in Canada. The sample included data from 165 student-athletes from      two universities. Results from structural equation modeling indicate support for       the effect of coaching practices on commitment to the coach. Results also support      the effect of commitment to the coach on the student-athletes' role behaviour and      performance. By showing that coaching practices impact commitment to the coach,      and that commitment to the coach impacts student-athlete role behaviour and      performance, the findings have important implications for a better understanding       of the determinants of coaches' and athletes' performance. The managerial      significance of this research rests in the insight provided into how coaching      practices influence athlete's behaviour through commitment to the coach. This      study contributes to the literature on coach-athlete relationship within      universities and colleges by applying the concept of commitment to the coach.      This helps diversity research approaches to understanding coach-athlete      relationships and extends prior research on commitment by looking at the context       of the relationship between the student-athlete and their coach.FAU - Rezania, DavarAU  - Rezania DAD  - Department of Management, College of Business and Economics, University of      Guelph, Guelph, Ontario N1G 2W1 Canada.FAU - Gurney, RobertAU  - Gurney RAD  - School of business, MacEwan University, 10700 104 Ave NW, Edmonton, Alberta T5J      4S2 Canada.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20140728PL  - SwitzerlandTA  - SpringerplusJT  - SpringerPlusJID - 101597967PMC - PMC4124108OID - NLM: PMC4124108OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Coach-athlete relationshipOT  - Coaching athletesOT  - Coaching teamsOT  - Commitment to the coachOT  - HRM and sportsOT  - Information sharingOT  - Intercollegiate sportOT  - Leader member exchangeOT  - Social exchangeOT  - TeamworkEDAT- 2014/08/12 06:00MHDA- 2014/08/12 06:01CRDT- 2014/08/09 06:00PHST- 2014 [ecollection]PHST- 2014/05/03 [received]PHST- 2014/07/17 [accepted]PHST- 2014/07/28 [epublish]AID - 10.1186/2193-1801-3-383 [doi]AID - 1087 [pii]PST - epublishSO  - Springerplus. 2014 Jul 28;3:383. doi: 10.1186/2193-1801-3-383. eCollection 2014.PMID- 25071505OWN - NLMSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINEDA  - 20140729DCOM- 20140729LR  - 20140731IS  - 1662-5161 (Electronic)IS  - 1662-5161 (Linking)VI  - 8DP  - 2014TI  - Short time sports exercise boosts motor imagery patterns: implications of mental       practice in rehabilitation programs.PG  - 469LID - 10.3389/fnhum.2014.00469 [doi]AB  - Motor imagery (MI) is a commonly used paradigm for the study of motor learning or      cognitive aspects of action control. The rationale for using MI training to      promote the relearning of motor function arises from research on the functional      correlates that MI shares with the execution of physical movements. While most of      the previous studies investigating MI were based on simple movements in the      present study a more attractive mental practice was used to investigate cortical       activation during MI. We measured cerebral responses with functional magnetic      resonance imaging (fMRI) in twenty three healthy volunteers as they imagined      playing soccer or tennis before and after a short physical sports exercise. Our      results demonstrated that only 10 min of training are enough to boost MI patterns      in motor related brain regions including premotor cortex and supplementary motor       area (SMA) but also fronto-parietal and subcortical structures. This supports      previous findings that MI has beneficial effects especially in combination with      motor execution when used in motor rehabilitation or motor learning processes. We      conclude that sports MI combined with an interactive game environment could be a       promising additional tool in future rehabilitation programs aiming to improve      upper or lower limb functions or support neuroplasticity.FAU - Wriessnegger, Selina CAU  - Wriessnegger SCAD  - Laboratory of Brain-Computer Interfaces, Institute for Knowledge Discovery, Graz       University of Technology Graz, Austria ; BioTechMed-Graz Graz, Austria.FAU - Steyrl, DavidAU  - Steyrl DAD  - Laboratory of Brain-Computer Interfaces, Institute for Knowledge Discovery, Graz       University of Technology Graz, Austria ; BioTechMed-Graz Graz, Austria.FAU - Koschutnig, KarlAU  - Koschutnig KAD  - BioTechMed-Graz Graz, Austria ; Department of Psychology, University of Graz      Graz, Austria.FAU - Muller-Putz, Gernot RAU  - Muller-Putz GRAD  - Laboratory of Brain-Computer Interfaces, Institute for Knowledge Discovery, Graz       University of Technology Graz, Austria ; BioTechMed-Graz Graz, Austria.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20140630PL  - SwitzerlandTA  - Front Hum NeurosciJT  - Frontiers in human neuroscienceJID - 101477954PMC - PMC4075334OID - NLM: PMC4075334OTO - NOTNLMOT  - functional magnetic resonance imagingOT  - motor imageryOT  - motor recoveryEDAT- 2014/07/30 06:00MHDA- 2014/07/30 06:01CRDT- 2014/07/30 06:00PHST- 2014 [ecollection]PHST- 2014/03/10 [received]PHST- 2014/06/09 [accepted]PHST- 2014/06/30 [epublish]AID - 10.3389/fnhum.2014.00469 [doi]PST - epublishSO  - Front Hum Neurosci. 2014 Jun 30;8:469. doi: 10.3389/fnhum.2014.00469. eCollection      2014.PMID- 25069563OWN - NLMSTAT- In-ProcessDA  - 20140729IS  - 1886-144X (Electronic)IS  - 0214-9915 (Linking)VI  - 26IP  - 3DP  - 2014 AugTI  - Psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the Controlling Coach Behaviors      Scale in the sport context.PG  - 409-14LID - 10.7334/psicothema2014.76 [doi]AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this research was to translate into Spanish and      examine the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the Controlling      Coach Behaviors Scale (CCBS) in male soccer players. The CCBS is a questionnaire       designed to assess athletes' perceptions of sports coaches' controlling      interpersonal style from the perspective of the self-determination theory.      METHOD: Study 1 tested the factorial structure of the translated scale using      confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and provided evidence of discriminant      validity. Studies 2 and 3 examined the invariance across time and across      competitive level via multi-sample CFA. Reliability analyses were also conducted.      RESULTS: The CFA results revealed that a four-factor model was acceptable,      indicating that a controlling interpersonal style is a multidimensional construct      represented by four separate and related controlling coaching strategies.      Further, results supported the invariance of the CCBS factor structure across      time and competitive level and provided support for the internal consistency of      the scale. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the CCBS demonstrated adequate internal      consistency, as well as good factorial validity. The Spanish version of the CCBS       represents a valid and reliable adaptation of the instrument, which can be      confidently used to measure soccer players' perceptions of their coaches'      controlling interpersonal style.FAU - Castillo, IsabelAU  - Castillo IAD  - University of Valencia (Spain).FAU - Tomas, InesAU  - Tomas IFAU - Ntoumanis, NikosAU  - Ntoumanis NFAU - Bartholomew, KimberleyAU  - Bartholomew KFAU - Duda, Joan LAU  - Duda JLFAU - Balaguer, IsabelAU  - Balaguer ILA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - SpainTA  - PsicothemaJT  - PsicothemaJID - 101189384SB  - IMEDAT- 2014/07/30 06:00MHDA- 2014/07/30 06:00CRDT- 2014/07/30 06:00AID - 4208 [pii]AID - 10.7334/psicothema2014.76 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Psicothema. 2014 Aug;26(3):409-14. doi: 10.7334/psicothema2014.76.PMID- 25023979OWN - NLMSTAT- In-ProcessDA  - 20140909IS  - 1873-4332 (Electronic)IS  - 1083-3188 (Linking)VI  - 27IP  - 5DP  - 2014 OctTI  - Knowledge of the female athlete Triad, and prevalence of Triad risk factors among      female high school athletes and their coaches.PG  - 278-82LID - 10.1016/j.jpag.2013.11.014 [doi]LID - S1083-3188(13)00348-3 [pii]AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine awareness/knowledge of the Triad      and its health implications among female high school athletes and their coaches,       and to evaluate coaches' Triad screening/intervention practices. DESIGN:      Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Two high schools in the western United States.      PARTICIPANTS: Female athletes from a variety of sports (N = 240) ages 14-18 years      and their coaches (N = 10). INTERVENTION: Participants completed surveys that      assessed Triad knowledge and athlete Triad risk factors. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:      Frequency of responses to Triad knowledge, Triad risk factor, and Triad      education/screening procedures questions; athlete summative knowledge score.      RESULTS: Half (N = 120) of participants reported menstrual irregularity, and 42%       (N = 101) had 2 or more Triad risk factors: past amenorrhea (N = 39), past stress      fracture (N = 41), self-reported not eating enough (N = 53), underweight      (BMI-for-age < 5(th) percentile) (N = 10), pressure to be a certain weight (N =      143), and wanting to lose >10 pounds when self-reported weight was in a healthy      range (N = 34). Average athlete Triad knowledge score was 2.97 +/- 1.61 out of 8.      Coach Triad knowledge was limited; however, most (9/10) were comfortable      discussing menstruation with their athletes. Barriers to Triad      screening/education were coaches' insufficient time, knowledge, and educational      resources. CONCLUSION: Triad risk factors were prevalent among athletes and coach      and athlete Triad knowledge was low. Providing coaches with Triad      screening/education training may increase Triad knowledge and decrease Triad risk      among high school athletes.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent      Gynecology.

As such, promoting      sport participation might be a way to increase life prospects, especially for      socially vulnerable youth because they are less physically active than their      peers. However, the evidence for the causal effect of sport participation on      these outcomes is still limited and little is known about factors that play a      role in this possible effect. The aim of this study is four-fold. First, the      causal effect of sport participation on life prospects is studied and the      underlying mechanisms of this relation are explored. Secondly, the life      experiences of the youngsters in the sport context, that may contribute to skill       development, are studied. Thirdly, social conditions for a positive effect are      explored, as sport is likely to have a positive effect under specific conditions.      Fourthly, this study aims to provide insights on the elements of successful      partnerships between youth care organisations and local sport clubs. METHODS AND       DESIGN: This protocol reports on a mixed method study. An intervention that aims       to increase the sport participation of socially vulnerable youth, between 12-23      years old, is implemented in three regions of a Rotterdam youth care      organisation. The youngsters in the two control regions receive care-as-usual.      The main outcome variables, collected via questionnaires, are the life prospect,       sense of coherence and self-regulation skills of the youngsters after 6 and 18      months of follow-up. The Motivational Climate Scale is administered to explore      the social conditions for a positive effect and interviews are conducted with      sport coaches to explore their role in skill development. Interviews with the      youngsters are conducted to gain insight on the life experiences that may lead to      skill development. The elements of successful partnerships are collected during      interviews with youth care professionals, sport coaches and other stakeholders in      the sport context. DISCUSSION: The results of this study can support efforts of      youth care organisations and local sport clubs to improve the life prospects of      socially vulnerable youth through sport participation.

METHODS: An electronic survey was distributed to 2668 middle      and high school coaches of contact sports in Alabama, and a paper survey was      completed by 79 certified athletic trainers (ATCs) in 2010. Questions focused on       their resource availability, knowledge of concussions based on the 2008 Consensus      Statement on Concussion in Sport: the 3rd International Conference on Concussion       in Sport (commonly known as the Zurich consensus statement), and management of      concussions. RESULTS: A total of 402 (16% response rate) coaches and 55 ATCs (70%      response rate) responded to the survey. This study highlights that ATC coverage      often is limited to the high school level, football, and competitions. Both      coaches and ATCs primarily use physicians to make return-to-play decisions,      although coaches (43.7%) usually refer to primary care physicians, whereas ATCs      (43.6%) refer to orthopedic or sports medicine physicians. The study also      revealed that coaches and ATCs desire education and could expand concussion      awareness by providing education to parents and athletes. No overall difference      was seen in the knowledge and management of concussions between coaches and ATCs;      however, ATCs were more likely to identify symptoms that are positive for      concussions (P = 0.04). Both groups had difficulty recognizing subtle symptoms      such as trouble sleeping, personality changes, and dizziness; they also were      unaware that strenuous mental activities could delay concussion recovery,      although ATCs scored significantly better than coaches (P < 0.001). Neither      coaches nor ATCs consistently use standardized measures such as the Sports      Concussion Assessment Tool 2 (7.5% vs 56.4%) or neuropsychological testing (5.3%       vs 14.5%). CONCLUSIONS: This study describes coaches' and ATCs' varying knowledge      and management techniques and highlights areas in which targeted interventions      and outreach could be useful. These areas include increased ATC availability,      coach/ATC concussion education, improved parent/athlete education, increased      "return to think" awareness, and more consistent use of Sports Concussion      Assessment Tool 2.FAU - Naftel, Kimberly GAU  - Naftel KGAD  - From the Division of Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Monroe Carell Jr Children's      Hospital at Vanderbilt, Nashville, Tennessee, the Division of Pediatric Emergency      Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, the Division of Pediatric Emergency      Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, the Southeast Child Safety      Institute, Children's of Alabama, University of Alabama at Birmingham, and the      Division of Pediatric Rehabilitation Medicine, University of Alabama at      Birmingham.FAU - Yust, Elizabeth MAU  - Yust EMAD  - From the Division of Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Monroe Carell Jr Children's      Hospital at Vanderbilt, Nashville, Tennessee, the Division of Pediatric Emergency      Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, the Division of Pediatric Emergency      Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, the Southeast Child Safety      Institute, Children's of Alabama, University of Alabama at Birmingham, and the      Division of Pediatric Rehabilitation Medicine, University of Alabama at      Birmingham.FAU - Nichols, Michele HAU  - Nichols MHAD  - From the Division of Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Monroe Carell Jr Children's      Hospital at Vanderbilt, Nashville, Tennessee, the Division of Pediatric Emergency      Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, the Division of Pediatric Emergency      Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, the Southeast Child Safety      Institute, Children's of Alabama, University of Alabama at Birmingham, and the      Division of Pediatric Rehabilitation Medicine, University of Alabama at      Birmingham.FAU - King, William DAU  - King WDAD  - From the Division of Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Monroe Carell Jr Children's      Hospital at Vanderbilt, Nashville, Tennessee, the Division of Pediatric Emergency      Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, the Division of Pediatric Emergency      Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, the Southeast Child Safety      Institute, Children's of Alabama, University of Alabama at Birmingham, and the      Division of Pediatric Rehabilitation Medicine, University of Alabama at      Birmingham.FAU - Davis, DrewAU  - Davis DAD  - From the Division of Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Monroe Carell Jr Children's      Hospital at Vanderbilt, Nashville, Tennessee, the Division of Pediatric Emergency      Medicine, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, the Division of Pediatric Emergency      Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, the Southeast Child Safety      Institute, Children's of Alabama, University of Alabama at Birmingham, and the      Division of Pediatric Rehabilitation Medicine, University of Alabama at      Birmingham.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - South Med JJT  - Southern medical journalJID - 0404522SB  - AIMSB  - IMCIN - South Med J. 2014 Jul;107(7):424-5.

RESULTS: This position       paper reviews and compares the components of sports-related concussion laws,      including education, removal from play, and clearance for return to play. It      highlights the challenges privacy laws present relevant to providing care to      concussed athletes and suggests ways to help physicians overcome these obstacles.      The report also explores the ethical considerations physicians should bear in      mind as they evaluate and manage concussed athletes, addressing them through a      framework that includes considerations of professionalism, informed      decision-making, patient autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, conflicts of      interest, and distributive justice. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians caring for concussed       athletes have an ethical obligation to ensure that their primary responsibility      is to safeguard the current and future physical and mental health of their      patients. Physicians have a duty to provide athletes and their parents with      information about concussion risk factors, symptoms, and the risks for      postconcussion neurologic impairments. Physicians should facilitate informed and       shared decision-making among athletes, parents, and medical teams while      protecting athletes from potential harm.

The purpose of this feasibility study was      to evaluate the intervention for attendance rates and retention in the program      provided in 5 sessions over 5 wk. Fourteen veterans from a specialty      postdeployment clinic at a Veterans Affairs hospital were enrolled; 11 completed       the study, and 10 attended >/=3 sessions. Participants reported clinically      meaningful improvement in PTSD symptom severity (PTSD Checklist-Military Version,      Wilcoxon signed rank Z = 2.5, p = .01) and in depressive symptoms (Major      Depression Inventory, Wilcoxon signed rank Z = 2.05, p = .04).

Eleven experienced coaches participated in semi-structured      interviews exploring their responses to, and challenges faced when, working with       athletes with eating problems. The analysis revealed three themes relating to the      strategies employed by coaches. The first theme indicated a supportive approach,       where coaches were proactive in seeking support and in reducing training at the      early stages of an eating problem. The second theme outlined an avoidant      approach, characterized by coach reluctance to be involved in managing eating      problems, and a lack of confidence in their knowledge of eating disorders. The      third theme involved a confrontational approach, where coaches employed strict      rules and engaged in coercion to persuade athletes to seek treatment. All of the       coaches reported facing challenges in persuading athletes to seek treatment and      were frustrated by the lack of available support. The study highlights the      importance of providing resources and support services where coaches can seek      advice. Coach-education packages can utilize the findings to highlight the      strengths and limitations of different coach strategies, and to reinforce the      importance of their role in identification and intervention when eating problems       in athletes are suspected.CI  - (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

This is of concern in post-conflict low-income settings where      non-communicable diseases are emerging and there is limited evidence for physical      activity interventions. We examined the effects of a sport-for-development      programme on adolescent physical fitness and mental health in Gulu, Uganda.      METHODS: We conducted a single-blinded RCT nested within an observational study      with three unbalanced parallel groups. Participants were able-bodied adolescents       aged 11-14 years. The intervention comprised an 11-week voluntary competitive      sport-for-development football league. Participants who did not subscribe for the      intervention formed a non-registered comparison group. Boys who registered for      the sport-for-development programme were randomly allocated to the intervention      or wait-listed. The girls programme subscription was insufficient to form a      wait-list and all registrants received the intervention. Physical fitness was      assessed by cardiorespiratory fitness (multi-stage fitness test), muscular power       (standing broad jump) and body composition (BMI-for-age). Mental health was      measured using the Acholi Psychosocial Assessment Instrument for local      depression-like (DLS) and anxiety-like (ALS) syndromes. All randomisation was      computer generated and assessors were masked to group allocation. An      intention-to-treat analysis of adjusted effect size (ES) was applied. RESULTS:      There were 1,462 adolescents in the study (intervention: boys = 74, girls = 81;      wait-list: boys = 72; comparison: boys = 472, girls = 763). At four months      follow-up there was no significant effect on the boys fitness when comparing      intervention vs wait-listed and intervention vs non-registered groups. However,      there was a negative effect on DLS when comparing boys intervention vs      wait-listed (ES = 0.67 [0.33 to 1.00]) and intervention vs non-registered (ES =      0.25 [0.00 to 0.49]). Similar results were observed for ALS for boys intervention      vs wait-listed (ES = 0.63 [0.30 to 0.96]) and intervention vs non-registered (ES       = 0.26 [0.01 to 0.50]). There was no significant effect on the girls for any      outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The sport-for-development league in this study had no      impact on fitness and a negative effect on the mental health of participating      boys. From this research, there is no evidence that voluntary competitive      sport-for-development interventions improve physical fitness or mental health      outcomes in post-conflict settings.FAU - Richards, JustinAU  - Richards JAD  - Nuffield Department of Population Health, British Heart Foundation Health      Promotion Research Group, University of Oxford, Rosemary Rue Building, Old Road      Campus, Roosevelt Drive, Headington, Oxford OX3 7LF, UK.      justin.a.richards@gmail.com.FAU - Foster, CharlieAU  - Foster CFAU - Townsend, NickAU  - Townsend NFAU - Bauman, AdrianAU  - Bauman ALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20140618PL  - EnglandTA  - BMC Public HealthJT  - BMC public healthJID - 100968562SB  - IMPMC - PMC4079830OID - NLM: PMC4079830EDAT- 2014/06/20 06:00MHDA- 2014/06/20 06:00CRDT- 2014/06/20 06:00PHST- 2013/11/16 [received]PHST- 2014/05/29 [accepted]PHST- 2014/06/18 [aheadofprint]AID - 1471-2458-14-619 [pii]AID - 10.1186/1471-2458-14-619 [doi]PST - epublishSO  - BMC Public Health. 2014 Jun 18;14:619. doi: 10.1186/1471-2458-14-619.PMID- 24942284OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20140702DCOM- 20150220LR  - 20141215IS  - 1469-3178 (Electronic)IS  - 1469-221X (Linking)VI  - 15IP  - 7DP  - 2014 JulTI  - Why exercise is good for your brain: A closer look at the underlying mechanisms      suggests that some sports, especially combined with mental activity, may be more       effective than others.PG  - 745-8LID - 10.15252/embr.201439051 [doi]FAU - Weigmann, KatrinAU  - Weigmann KAD  - Freelance journalist in Oldenburg, Germany.LA  - engPT  - EditorialPT  - Introductory Journal ArticleDEP - 20140618PL  - EnglandTA  - EMBO RepJT  - EMBO reportsJID - 100963049SB  - IMMH  - Alzheimer Disease/diagnosis/prevention & controlMH  - AnimalsMH  - Brain/pathology/*physiologyMH  - Cell SurvivalMH  - CognitionMH  - *ExerciseMH  - HumansMH  - SportsPMC - PMC4196976OID - NLM: PMC4196976 [Available on 07/01/15]EDAT- 2014/06/20 06:00MHDA- 2015/02/24 06:00CRDT- 2014/06/20 06:00PMCR- 2015/07/01 00:00PHST- 2014/06/18 [aheadofprint]AID - embr.201439051 [pii]AID - 10.15252/embr.201439051 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - EMBO Rep. 2014 Jul;15(7):745-8. doi: 10.15252/embr.201439051.

OBJECTIVE: To examine secondary school football coaches' perceived       knowledge of EHS and their professional relationship with an AT. DESIGN:      Qualitative study. SETTING: Web-based management system. PATIENTS OR OTHER      PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-eight secondary school head football coaches (37 men, 1      woman) participated in this study. Their average age was 47 +/- 10 years old, and      they had 12 +/- 9 years' experience as a head football coach. DATA COLLECTION AND      ANALYSIS: Participants responded to a series of online questions that were      focused on their perceived knowledge of EHS and professional relationships with      ATs. Data credibility was established through multiple-analyst triangulation and       peer review. We analyzed the data by borrowing from the principles of a general      inductive approach. RESULTS: Two dominant themes emerged from the data: perceived      self-confidence of the secondary school coach and the influence of the AT. The      first theme highlighted the perceived confidence, due to basic emergency care      training, of the coach regarding management of an emergency situation, despite a       lack of knowledge. The second theme illustrated the secondary school coach's      positive professional relationships with ATs regarding patient care and emergency      procedures. Of the coaches who participated, 89% (34 out of 38) indicated      positive interactions with their ATs. CONCLUSIONS: These secondary school coaches      were unaware of the potential causes of EHS or the symptoms associated with EHS,       and they had higher perceived levels of self-confidence in management abilities      than indicated by their perceived knowledge level. The secondary school football       coaches valued and understood the role of the AT regarding patient and emergency       care.FAU - Adams, William MAU  - Adams WMAD  - Korey Stringer Institute, Department of Kinesiology, University of Connecticut,      Storrs.FAU - Mazerolle, Stephanie MAU  - Mazerolle SMFAU - Casa, Douglas JAU  - Casa DJFAU - Huggins, Robert AAU  - Huggins RAFAU - Burton, LauraAU  - Burton LLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20140616PL  - United StatesTA  - J Athl TrainJT  - Journal of athletic trainingJID - 9301647SB  - IMPMC - PMC4151835OID - NLM: PMC4151835 [Available on 07/01/15]OTO - NOTNLMOT  - coach's knowledgeOT  - emergency careOT  - heat injuriesOT  - sudden death in sportEDAT- 2014/06/17 06:00MHDA- 2014/06/17 06:00CRDT- 2014/06/17 06:00PMCR- 2015/07/01 00:00PHST- 2014/06/16 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.4085/1062-6050-49.3.01 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Athl Train. 2014 Jul-Aug;49(4):469-77. doi: 10.4085/1062-6050-49.3.01.

METHODS:      Adolescents (n = 853) reported participation in school sport in each grade      throughout the 5 years of secondary school. In early adulthood, participants      reported depressive symptoms, level of stress, and self-rated mental health.      RESULTS: Involvement in school sport during adolescence was a statistically      significant predictor of lower depression symptoms, lower perceived stress, and      higher self-rated mental health in young adulthood. CONCLUSIONS: School sport      participation may protect against poor mental health in early adulthood. Policies      to increase school sport participation may be warranted as part of public health       strategies to promote mental health.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

DESIGN: Retrospective study of      electronic medical records from the office-based practice of one family and sport      medicine physician who had systematically provided recommendations for cognitive       and physical rest based on existing consensus recommendations. Two blinded      authors independently reviewed each chart, which included Sport Concussion      Assessment Tool (SCAT) and SCAT2 symptom self-report forms to determine whether      an athlete had returned to play or learn prematurely. If there was a discrepancy       between the 2 reviewers then a third author reviewed the charts. SETTING: A sport      medicine and family practice in Ontario. The physician assessed sport-related      concussions after self-referral or referral from other primary care physicians,      teams, and schools. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 170 charts of 159 patients were      assessed for sport-related concussion during a 5-year period (April 2006 to March      2011). All participants were students who were participating in sports at the      time of injury. There were 41 concussions in elementary students, 95 concussions       in high school students, and 34 concussions in college or university students.      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Premature RTP and RTL were defined as chart records      documenting the recurrence or worsening of symptoms that accompanied the      patients' RTP or RTL. Measures were compared using the earliest available SCAT      forms and self-reporting. RESULTS: In 43.5% of concussion cases, the patient      returned to sport too soon and in 44.7% of concussion cases, the patient returned      to school too soon. Patients with a history of previous concussion required more       days of rest before being permitted to participate in any physical activity than       those patients without a previous history of concussion. Elementary school      students required fewer days of rest before being permitted to return to any      physical activity compared with high school students and college or university      students. CONCLUSION: Currently, physicians recommend restrictions on mental and       physical activity following sport-related concussion. This is done without clear       guidelines as to what cognitive rest entails for students. Further research is      required to determine how to implement a management plan for student athletes to       facilitate complete recovery after concussion.CI  - Copyright(c) the College of Family Physicians of Canada.FAU - Carson, James DAU  - Carson JDAD  - Department of Family and Community Medicine at the University of Toronto in      Ontario. james.carson@utoronto.ca.FAU - Lawrence, David WAU  - Lawrence DWAD  - Family medicine resident, Department of Family and Community Medicine at the      University of Toronto in Ontario.FAU - Kraft, Sari AAU  - Kraft SAAD  - Sport and exercise medicine fellow, Department of Family and Community Medicine      at the University of Toronto in Ontario.FAU - Garel, AlishaAU  - Garel AAD  - Medical student at the Medical University of the Americas in Nevis.FAU - Snow, Catherine LAU  - Snow CLAD  - Student at York University in North York, Ont.FAU - Chatterjee, AnandaAU  - Chatterjee AAD  - Family medicine resident at Grand Rapids Medical Education Partners and Michigan       State University.FAU - Libfeld, PaulaAU  - Libfeld PAD  - Graduate of the University of King's College in Halifax, NS.FAU - MacKenzie, Heather MAU  - MacKenzie HMAD  - Physical medicine and rehabilitation resident at the University of Western      Ontario in London.FAU - Thornton, Jane SAU  - Thornton JSAD  - Medical student at the University of Toronto.FAU - Moineddin, RahimAU  - Moineddin RAD  - Associate Professor in the Department of Family and Community Medicine at the      University of Toronto.FAU - Fremont, PierreAU  - Fremont PAD  - Associate Professor in the Department of Rehabilitation and Affiliated Professor       in the Department of Family Medicine at Laval University in Quebec.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - CanadaTA  - Can Fam PhysicianJT  - Canadian family physician Medecin de famille canadienJID - 0120300SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Aptitude TestsMH  - Athletes/classification/psychology/statistics & numerical dataMH  - Athletic Injuries/diagnosis/physiopathology/psychology/*rehabilitationMH  - Brain Concussion/diagnosis/physiopathology/psychology/*rehabilitationMH  - CanadaMH  - ChildMH  - *Family Practice/methods/standardsMH  - FemaleMH  - Health Planning GuidelinesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Outcome Assessment (Health Care)MH  - Physical Fitness/physiology/psychologyMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Sports/classification/statistics & numerical dataMH  - *Students/classification/psychology/statistics & numerical dataMH  - Young AdultPMC - PMC4055342OID - NLM: PMC4055342EDAT- 2014/06/14 06:00MHDA- 2015/02/11 06:00CRDT- 2014/06/14 06:00AID - 60/6/e310 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Can Fam Physician. 2014 Jun;60(6):e310, e312-5.PMID- 24924730OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20140613DCOM- 20150223IS  - 1435-1250 (Electronic)IS  - 0340-1855 (Linking)VI  - 73IP  - 5DP  - 2014 JunTI  - [Sport and rheumatoid arthritis].PG  - 434-8LID - 10.1007/s00393-013-1341-4 [doi]AB  - BACKGROUND: Sport is becoming increasingly more important in our society. Due to       the changing age spectrum with a greater number of elderly and substantially more      active people, an increasing number of people with underlying orthopedic diseases      are becoming interested in participating in sport. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This      article deals with the possibilities and effects of sporting activities for      people with rheumatoid arthritis within the framework of a conservative therapy.       A literature search was carried out using medical search engines, in particular      PubMed, and also via the recommendations of specialist societies and patient help      groups. RESULTS: The quality of life of patients with rheumatoid arthritis      consists of physical, mental and social components. Sport as a means of      rehabilitation influences all of these components. Sport should be comprehended      as a form of therapy and be adapted to the needs of the individual patient. The      willingness to actively participate in sport should always be highly rated and      encouraged. Sport is therefore an important pillar of therapy in a conservative      total concept. The main aspects of sport therapeutic activities are functional,      pedagogical and experience-oriented aspects. The clinical symptoms, extent of      damage and physical impairment must, however, be evaluated and taken into      consideration for the therapeutic concept. CONCLUSION: The amount of data on the       complex topic of sport and rheumatoid arthritis is low and is mainly dealt with      as retrospective reviews. A prospective randomized study basis is lacking. The      aim must therefore be to confirm the currently available recommendations for      various types of sport in controlled studies.FAU - Proschek, DAU  - Proschek DAD  - Zentrum fur Orthopadie und Unfallchirurgie, Universitatsmedizin Mainz,      Langenbeckstr. 1, 55131, Mainz, Deutschland, dirk.proschek@unimedizin-mainz.de.FAU - Rehart, SAU  - Rehart SLA  - gerPT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewTT  - Sport und rheumatoide Arthritis.PL  - GermanyTA  - Z RheumatolJT  - Zeitschrift fur RheumatologieJID - 0414162SB  - IMMH  - Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*prevention & control/*rehabilitationMH  - Evidence-Based MedicineMH  - Exercise Therapy/*methodsMH  - HumansMH  - Physical Conditioning, Human/*methodsMH  - *Risk Reduction BehaviorMH  - *SportsMH  - Treatment OutcomeEDAT- 2014/06/14 06:00MHDA- 2015/02/24 06:00CRDT- 2014/06/14 06:00AID - 10.1007/s00393-013-1341-4 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Z Rheumatol. 2014 Jun;73(5):434-8. doi: 10.1007/s00393-013-1341-4.PMID- 24919411OWN - NLMSTAT- PublisherDA  - 20140612IS  - 1600-0838 (Electronic)IS  - 0905-7188 (Linking)DP  - 2014 Jun 12TI  - Motives for sports participation as predictions of self-reported outcomes after      anterior cruciate ligament injury of the knee.LID - 10.1111/sms.12249 [doi]AB  - Aim of the study was to access how individual's motives for participation in      sports impact on self-reported outcomes 2 years after an anterior cruciate      ligament injury. Based on a longitudinal cohort study, this secondary analysis      present data from the Knee Anterior Cruciate Ligament, Nonsurgical versus      Surgical Treatment (KANON) study, a randomized controlled trial. At baseline, 121      patients recorded in an initial questionnaire that their motives for sports      participation fell into four categories: achievement, health, social integration,      or fun and well-being. These four categories were used as variables in the      analyses. All 121 subjects completed the 2-year follow-up. The largest      improvement was seen in the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)      subscale sports and recreation function, with an effect size of 2.43. KOOS sports      and recreation function was also the subscale score best predicted by the motives      for sports participation. Baseline motives achievement and fun and well-being      predicted worse levels of pain and function 2 years after the injury, even after       adjusting for age, gender, treatment and baseline scores. Psychological aspects,       such as motives for participation in sport, can be factors in predicting of      patient-reported outcomes 2 years after injury. Evaluating motives for sports      participation may help predict the outcome 2 years after ACL injury.CI  - (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

We      hypothesized that psychological needs satisfaction (thwarting) would be      associated with higher (lower) levels of mental toughness, positive affect, and      performance and lower (higher) levels of negative affect. We also expected that      mental toughness would be associated with higher levels of positive affect and      performance and lower levels of negative affect. Further, we predicted that      coaching environments would be related to mental toughness indirectly through      psychological needs and that psychological needs would indirectly relate with      performance and affect through mental toughness. Adolescent cross-country runners      (136 male and 85 female, M(age) = 14.36) completed questionnaires pertaining to      BPNT variables, mental toughness, and affect. Race times were also collected. Our      findings supported our hypotheses. We concluded that BPNT is generative in      understanding some of the antecedents and consequences of mental toughness and is      a novel framework useful for understanding mental toughness.FAU - Mahoney, John WAU  - Mahoney JWAD  - School of Human Movement Studies, University of Queensland.FAU - Gucciardi, Daniel FAU  - Gucciardi DFFAU - Ntoumanis, NikosAU  - Ntoumanis NFAU - Mallett, Cliff JAU  - Mallett CJLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Sport Exerc PsycholJT  - Journal of sport & exercise psychologyJID - 8809258SB  - IMEIN - J Sport Exerc Psychol. 2014 Jun;36(3). doi: 10.1123/jsep.2013-0260.

First, a pilot study      was conducted with context (n = 10) and construct (n = 6) specialists, who      evaluated the technical quality and content validity of 20 items developed from      semistructured interviews. Thirteen items were selected for Study 1, which tested      the factorial validity and reliability scores of coaches' (n = 343) responses to       the CIPS items. An eight-item structure, consisting of two factors (centrality      and evaluative emotions) was selected as the final CIPS measure, which was      examined with a final sample of coaches (n = 454) in Study 2 to evaluate the      factorial validity, group invariance, concurrent validity, and nomological      validity of respondents' scores to the CIPS.

Small-sided games are often       employed by coaches based on the premise that the greatest training benefits      occur when training simulates the specific movement patterns and physiological      demands of the sport. At present, there is relatively little information      regarding how SSG can best be used to improve physical capacities and technical      and tactical skills in team sports. It is possible that with some modifications      (e.g., number of players, pitch size, coach encouragement, and wrestling), such      games may be physiologically beneficial for athletes with relatively high initial      aerobic fitness levels. For instance, it has been shown that 3-a-side soccer SSG       resulted in higher intensity (i.e., greater overall distance, less jogging and      walking, higher heart rate, and more tackling, dribbling, goal attempts, and      passes) than 5-a-side SSG. Likewise, when player numbers were kept constant, a      larger playing area increased the intensity of the SSG with a smaller playing      area having the opposite effect. It has also been demonstrated that energy      expenditure was similar between badminton and volleyball courts, but lower than      that obtained in a basketball court. Moreover, it has been demonstrated in rugby       that wrestling can increase the physical demands of SSG. Consistent coach      encouragement can also increase training intensity, although most rule changes      have trivial or no effect on exercise intensity. Further research is required to       examine the optimal periodization strategies of SSG training for the long-term      development of physiological capacity, technical skill, and tactical proficiency,      while also minimizing the associated risk of injuries.FAU - Halouani, JamelAU  - Halouani JAD  - 1Tunisian Research Laboratory "Sport Performance Optimization," National Center      of Medicine and Science in Sport (CNMSS), Tunis, Tunisia; 2High Institute of      Sport and Physical Education, University of Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia; 3School of      Exercise Science, Australian Catholic University, Brisbane, Australia; 4School of      Human Movement Studies, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia; and      5Athlete Health and Performance Research Centre, Aspetar, Qatar Orthopaedic and      Sports Medicine Hospital, Doha, Qatar.FAU - Chtourou, HamdiAU  - Chtourou HFAU - Gabbett, TimAU  - Gabbett TFAU - Chaouachi, AnisAU  - Chaouachi AFAU - Chamari, KarimAU  - Chamari KLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Strength Cond ResJT  - Journal of strength and conditioning research / National Strength & Conditioning       AssociationJID - 9415084SB  - IMEDAT- 2014/06/12 06:00MHDA- 2014/06/12 06:00CRDT- 2014/06/12 06:00AID - 10.1519/JSC.0000000000000564 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Strength Cond Res. 2014 Dec;28(12):3594-618. doi: 10.1519/JSC.0000000000000564.PMID- 24911047OWN - NLMSTAT- In-ProcessDA  - 20140828IS  - 1466-447X (Electronic)IS  - 0264-0414 (Linking)VI  - 32IP  - 18DP  - 2014TI  - Perceived coach-created and peer-created motivational climates and their      associations with team cohesion and athlete satisfaction: evidence from a      longitudinal study.PG  - 1738-50LID - 10.1080/02640414.2014.918641 [doi]AB  - In this longitudinal study, we examined the extent to which perceived coach- and       peer-created motivational climates are associated with athlete-group cohesion and      satisfaction with participation among Spanish soccer players competing in the      Third National Division.

Also, perceived      peer-created task climate related positively to perceived cohesion.

DESIGN: Two-year follow up study of a sample of 4042 Australian children who were      followed from age 8 years to 10 years. METHODS: Parents reported children's      participation in organised sports, and completed the Strengths and Difficulties      Questionnaire. Univariate general linear models were used to examine the      association between changes in sports participation and psychological strengths      and difficulties at 10 years, adjusting for psychological strengths and      difficulties at age 8. RESULTS: Children who maintained participation in sport      had lower rates of parent-reported psychological difficulties at 10 years      compared with children who dropped out of sport. Less internalising problems were      also reported for children who participated in organised sports compared to      children who dropped out of sports and children who did not participate in      sports. These relationships did not differ by BMI, socioeconomic status, or      parental education. CONCLUSIONS: Greater psychological difficulties are      experienced by children who drop out of sports, and greater social and emotional       problems are experienced by children who drop out of sports and who do not      participate in organised sports. Due consideration should be given to the quality      and implementation of sporting programs to ensure that they provide benefits to      mental health. Due consideration should also be given to the potential      psychological difficulties being experienced by children who drop out of      organised sports as a higher level of psychological difficulties may be      experienced prior to or subsequent to dropout.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Sports Medicine Australia.

The Olympics sees      countries from all over the globe participate in elite sport, in both winter and       summer competitions. Australia is widely known for cricket and rugby; America is       known for baseball and gridiron football (among others). These sports are played       at an elite level as well as beginners from early ages as young as 4 years in the      backyard. Yet, it is also these sports that can deliver a ball at the speed of      100 km/h (football), 105 km/h (baseball), 112 km/h (rugby), 150 km/h (cricket),      and 211 km/h (soccer). This is the same force that a car collision can produce.      That force eventually finds a target, and in some cases, unfortunately, it is a      head. Damage to the brain is not only from the impact of the ball hitting its      target but rather also the shearing forces of acceleration-deceleration injury      that can cause extensive injuries. There has been much discussion of late      regarding concussion in sport and the accumulative effects of head blows      resulting in varying degrees of memory loss and dementia later in life. The media      have been saturated with heightened awareness of chronic traumatic      encephalopathy. This, however, is still being researched. It is true that each      concussion compounds the one before, but rather than focus on the injury,      managers/coaches and sporting codes should be focusing on the identification and       proper management of a suspected concussion and the return-to-play protocols.      This is especially important in our schools where growing brains need nurturing.       Neuroscience nurses are at the forefront of educating school children, teachers,       and coaches through partnering with local schools.

The rates were higher among service members who were male,       Hispanic, in the youngest age groups, in the Army, junior enlisted, and in      combat-specific occupations. The rate among recruit/ trainees (779.4 per 10,000      p-yrs) was more than 165 times the rate among all other active component service       members (non-recruits) (4.7 per 10,000 p-yrs). Sprains, strains, and contusions      accounted for more than one-half of the primary (first-listed) diagnoses      associated with combat sports cases. More serious conditions such as      concussions/head injuries and skull/face fractures/intracranial injuries were      reported among 3.9% and 2.1% of all cases and were more common among      boxing-related cases. Hand/wrist fractures were also common among boxing cases.      Wrestling had comparatively greater proportions of dislocations and open wounds.       Although the combat sport training provides many physical and mental benefits to       the individual, safety practices should be enforced to reduce the most frequent      and serious injuries.CN  - Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center (AFHSC)LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - MSMRJT  - MSMRJID - 101548156SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Age FactorsMH  - Athletic Injuries/*epidemiologyMH  - Boxing/injuriesMH  - Brain Concussion/epidemiologyMH  - Carpal Bones/*injuriesMH  - Contusions/epidemiologyMH  - Facial Bones/*injuriesMH  - FemaleMH  - Fractures, Bone/*epidemiologyMH  - HumansMH  - IncidenceMH  - MaleMH  - Martial Arts/injuriesMH  - Military Personnel/*statistics & numerical dataMH  - *Population SurveillanceMH  - Sex FactorsMH  - Shoulder Dislocation/epidemiologyMH  - Sprains and Strains/epidemiologyMH  - United States/epidemiologyMH  - Wrestling/injuriesMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2014/06/03 06:00MHDA- 2015/01/28 06:00CRDT- 2014/06/03 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - MSMR. 2014 May;21(5):16-8.PMID- 24881902OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20140602DCOM- 20141231IS  - 1938-1344 (Electronic)IS  - 0190-6011 (Linking)VI  - 44IP  - 6DP  - 2014 JunTI  - Coming to terms with early sports specialization and athletic injuries.PG  - 389-90LID - 10.2519/jospt.2014.0109 [doi]AB  - The body grows stronger and performs best when appropriate loads and activities      are followed by appropriate physical and mental rest and recovery.

AIMS: The purpose       of this research was to test and compare associations between participation in      organised activities and indicators of hazardous drinking between young offenders      and young non-offenders. METHODS: Two groups of 13-18 year-old males were      recruited in Cardiff, UK: 93 young offenders and 53 non-offenders from secondary       schools matched on estimated IQ, sex and socioeconomic status. Indicators of      hazardous drinking were measured using the Fast Alcohol Screening Test (FAST).      Organised activity participation and externalising behaviour was measured by the       Youth Self Report. The Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence was also      administered. RESULTS: Young offenders participated in fewer organised activities      and had higher FAST scores than non-offenders. Young offenders and non-offenders       significantly differed on mean FAST scores if they participated in no organised      activities but not if they participated in at least one team sport. Externalising      behaviour problems were unrelated to participation in organised activities.      CONCLUSIONS: Although young offenders were less likely to have participated in      organised activities, for them, participation in a team sport was associated with      less hazardous drinking. Vulnerable youths who might benefit most from sporting      activities actually access them the least. Future research should identify the      different barriers to participation that they face.

The sample consisted of 523 masters swimmers      (330 males and 193 females) aged between 22 and 83 years (M = 39.00, SD = 10.42).      A bi-dimensional commitment scale was used to measure commitment dimensions and      perceived influence from social agents. Structural equation modelling analysis      was conducted to evaluate the influence of social agents on functional and      obligatory commitments, and the predictive capabilities of the two types of      commitment towards sport participation. Support provided by coach and teammates      increased functional commitment, constraints from these social agents determined       higher obligatory commitment, and coach constraints negatively impacted      functional commitment. In addition, both commitment types predicted training      participation, with functional commitment increasing participation in team      training sessions, and obligatory commitment increasing the hours of individual      training. The findings suggest that in order to increase participation in masters      swimming teams and reduce non-supervised training, coach and teammates should      exhibit a supportive attitude and avoid over expectation.FAU - Santi, GiampaoloAU  - Santi GAD  - a Department of Psychology , University of Bologna , Bologna , Italy.FAU - Bruton, AdamAU  - Bruton AFAU - Pietrantoni, LucaAU  - Pietrantoni LFAU - Mellalieu, StephenAU  - Mellalieu SLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20140515PL  - EnglandTA  - Eur J Sport SciJT  - European journal of sport scienceJID - 101146739SB  - IMOTO - NOTNLMOT  - Sport commitmentOT  - functional commitmentOT  - masters swimmingOT  - obligatory commitmentOT  - social supportEDAT- 2014/05/16 06:00MHDA- 2014/05/16 06:00CRDT- 2014/05/16 06:00PHST- 2014/05/15 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1080/17461391.2014.915990 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur J Sport Sci. 2014;14(8):852-60. doi: 10.1080/17461391.2014.915990.

The guidelines include a six-step process that      provides structure to guide an athlete who is recovering from a concussion in a      gradual return to play (RTP) by allowing participation in increasingly difficult       physical activities. Unfortunately, the guidelines fail to take into account the       variability that occurs within different sports and the resulting challenges      medical professionals face in making sure each athlete is able to withstand the      rigors of their specific sport, without return of symptoms. Therefore, the      purpose of this clinical commentary is to expand upon the current general      consensus guidelines for treatment of concussed pediatric athletes and provide      sport specific RTP guidelines. DESCRIPTION OF TOPIC: The intention of the sport      specific guidelines is to maintain the integrity of the current six-step model,      add a moderate activity phase highlighted by resistance training, and to provide       contact and limited contact drills specific to the athlete's sport and/or      position. The drills and activities in the proposed seven-step programs are      designed to simulate sport specific movements; the sports include: football,      gymnastics, cheerleading, wrestling, soccer, basketball, lacrosse, baseball,      softball, and ice hockey. These activities will provide sports specific      challenges to each athlete while simultaneously accomplishing the objectives of      each stage of the RTP progression. The final RTP determination should occur with       documented medical clearance from a licensed healthcare provider who has been      trained in the evaluation and management of concussions. DISCUSSION/RELATION TO      CLINICAL PRACTICE: There have been significant strides in the management and care      of concussed athletes. However, there continues to be a lot of confusion among,      athletes, parents, and coaches regarding the proper management of an athlete with      a concussion, particularly in the pediatric population. In an effort to eliminate      ambiguity and help further promote adherence to the RTP guidelines, the authors      developed several sports-specific RTP guidelines.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop a theoretical      framework of fun using a novel mixed-method assessment of participants in sport      (FUN MAPS) via concept mapping. METHODS: Youth soccer players (n = 142), coaches       (n = 37), and parents (n = 57) were stratified by age, sex, and competition level      and contributed their "fun" ideas through: (a) qualitative brainstorming,      identifying all of the things that make playing sports fun for players; (b)      sorting of ideas; and (c) rating each idea on its importance, frequency, and      feasibility. RESULTS: The FUN MAPS identify the four fundamental tenets of fun in      youth sport within 11 fun-dimensions composed of 81 specific fun-determinants,      while also establishing the youth sport ethos. CONCLUSION: The FUN MAPS provide      pictorial evidence-based blueprints for the fun integration theory (FIT), which      is a multi-theoretical, multidimensional, and stakeholder derived framework that       can be used to maximize fun for children and adolescents in order to promote and       sustain an active and healthy lifestyle through sport.FAU - Visek, Amanda JAU  - Visek AJAD  - Department of Exercise Science, The George Washington University, Washington, DC.FAU - Achrati, Sara MAU  - Achrati SMFAU - Manning, HeatherAU  - Manning HFAU - McDonnell, KarenAU  - McDonnell KFAU - Harris, Brandon SAU  - Harris BSFAU - Dipietro, LorettaAU  - Dipietro LLA  - ENGGR  - K01 NR012770/NR/NINR NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLEDEP - 20140417TA  - J Phys Act HealthJT  - Journal of physical activity & healthJID - 101189457PMC - PMC4201634MID - NIHMS621228EDAT- 2014/04/29 06:00MHDA- 2014/04/29 06:00CRDT- 2014/04/29 06:00PMCR- 2015/10/17 00:00AID - 2013-0180 [pii]AID - 10.1123/jpah.2013-0180 [doi]PST - aheadofprintSO  - J Phys Act Health. 2014 Apr 17.PMID- 24751173OWN - NLMSTAT- In-ProcessDA  - 20140603IS  - 1471-2458 (Electronic)IS  - 1471-2458 (Linking)VI  - 14DP  - 2014TI  - Increasing girls' physical activity during an organised youth sport basketball      program: a randomised controlled trial protocol.PG  - 383LID - 10.1186/1471-2458-14-383 [doi]AB  - BACKGROUND: Participation in organised youth sports (OYS) has been recommended as      an opportunity to increase young peoples' moderate-to-vigorous physical activity       (MVPA) levels. Participants, however, spend a considerable proportion of time      during OYS inactive. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to investigate      whether coaches who attended coach education sessions (where education on      increasing MVPA and decreasing inactivity during training was delivered) can      increase players' MVPA during training sessions over a 5-day basketball program      compared to coaches who did not receive coach education sessions. METHODS/DESIGN:      A convenience sample of 80 female players and 8 coaches were recruited into the      UWS School Holiday Basketball Program in Greater Western Sydney, Australia. A      two-arm, parallel-group randomised controlled trial was employed to investigate      whether coaches who attended 2 coach education sessions (compared with a      no-treatment control) can increase their players' MVPA during training sessions      over a 5-day basketball program. Objectively measured physical activity, directly      observed lesson context and leader behaviour, player motivation, players'      perceived autonomy support, and coaching information (regarding training session       planning, estimations on player physical activity and lesson context during      training, perceived ability to modify training sessions, perceived importance of       physical activity during training, intention to increase physical activity/reduce      inactivity, and likelihood of increasing physical activity/reducing inactivity)      were assessed at baseline (day 1) and at follow-up (day 5). Linear mixed models      will be used to analyse between arm differences in changes from baseline to      follow-up on all outcomes. DISCUSSION: The current trial protocol describes, to      our knowledge, the first trial conducted in an OYS context to investigate the      efficacy of an intervention, relative to a control, in increasing MVPA. This      study's findings will provide evidence to inform strategies targeting coaches to       increase MVPA in OYS, which could have major public health implications, given      the high proportion of children and adolescents who participate in OYS globally.

Recent research, much of which has      involved global positioning system (GPS) technology, has provided coaches and      sport scientists with a deeper understanding of match demands, particularly at      the elite level. This has allowed for the development of training programmes that      prepare players for the most intense contact and running demands likely to be      experienced in competition. At the elite level, rugby league players have      well-developed aerobic and anaerobic endurance, muscular strength and power,      reactive agility, and speed. Upper- and lower-body strength and aerobic power are      associated with a broad range of technical and sport-specific skills, in addition      to a lower risk of injury. Significant muscle damage (as estimated from creatine       kinase concentrations) and fatigue occurs as a result of match-play; while muscle      function and perceptual fatigue generally return to baseline 48 h following      competition, increases in plasma concentrations of creatine kinase can last for      up to 5 days post-match. Well-developed physical qualities may minimise      post-match fatigue and facilitate recovery. Ultimately, the literature highlights      that players require a broad range of physical and technical skills developed      through specific training. This review evaluates the demands of the modern game,       drawing on research that has used GPS technology. These findings highlight that      preparing players based on the average demands of competition is likely to leave       them underprepared for the most demanding passages of play. As such, coaches      should incorporate drills that replicate the most intense repeated high-intensity      demands of competition in order to prepare players for the worst-case scenarios      expected during match-play.FAU - Johnston, Rich DAU  - Johnston RDAD  - School of Exercise Science, Australian Catholic University, 1100 Nudgee Road,      Brisbane, QLD, 4014, Australia, richard.johnston@acu.edu.au.FAU - Gabbett, Tim JAU  - Gabbett TJFAU - Jenkins, David GAU  - Jenkins DGLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - New ZealandTA  - Sports MedJT  - Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)JID - 8412297SB  - IMEDAT- 2014/04/22 06:00MHDA- 2014/04/22 06:00CRDT- 2014/04/22 06:00AID - 10.1007/s40279-014-0190-x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Sports Med. 2014 Aug;44(8):1087-100. doi: 10.1007/s40279-014-0190-x.PMID- 24727434OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20140414DCOM- 20141211IS  - 2072-6643 (Electronic)IS  - 2072-6643 (Linking)VI  - 6IP  - 4DP  - 2014 AprTI  - Nutritional knowledge of UK coaches.PG  - 1442-53LID - 10.3390/nu6041442 [doi]AB  - Athletes obtain nutritional information from their coaches, yet their competency       in this area is lacking. Currently, no research exists in the UK which has a      different coach education system to many other countries. Therefore, the aim of      this study was to evaluate the sports nutrition knowledge of UK coaching      certificate (UKCC) level 2 and 3, hockey and netball qualified coaches. All      coaches (n = 163) completed a sports nutrition questionnaire to identify: (a) if       they provided nutritional advice; (b) their level of sport nutrition knowledge;      and (c) factors that may have contributed to their level of knowledge. Over half       the coaches provided advice to their athletes (n = 93, 57.1%), even though they      were not competent to do so. Coaches responded correctly to 60.3 +/- 10.5% of all      knowledge questions with no differences between those providing advice and those       who did not (p > 0.05).

Data regarding the prevalence of medical and psychosocial needs after the      earthquake is scarce, complicating informed targeting of aid. The effects of the       earthquake on athletes, as they differ from the general population, are      especially unclear. The Center for Disaster Resilience (Boston, Massachusetts      USA) and the Disaster Medicine Section at Harvard Medical School (Boston,      Massachusetts USA) have partnered with Child in Hand to care for athletes      training for the Pan American and Olympic games in Haiti, as well as for children      from the general population. This report presents preliminary epidemiologic data       illustrating the burden of medical and psychosocial needs of Haitian athletes and      the general population after the earthquake of 2010. METHODS: The study was a      cross-sectional, comparative study conducted a year after the earthquake. The      study group comprised 104 athletes, aged 12-18 years, enrolled from the National       Sports Center in Haiti. The control group (N = 104) from the general population      was age- and gender-matched from orphanages and schools in and around      Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Medical teams assessed illness based on history and      physicals. Psychosocial teams utilized the Child Psychosocial Distress Screener      (CPDS). Two-proportion z tests and two-sample t tests were used to compare the      proportions of medical illnesses, mean CPDS scores, and proportion of CPDS scores      indicating treatment. RESULTS: The most prevalent medical condition in athletes      was musculoskeletal pain, which was more common than in controls (49% versus      2.9%). All other medical conditions were more common in the controls than      athletes: abdominal pain (28.8% versus 4.8%); headache (22.1% versus 5.8%); fever      (15.4% versus 1%); and malnutrition (18.3% versus 1.9%). In contrast, there was      no significant difference in mean psychosocial scores and the proportion of      scores indicating treatment between athletes and controls. CONCLUSION: Elite      athletes in Haiti have a low prevalence of most medical conditions after the      disaster, suggesting that they may be protected from risk factors affecting the      general population. However, athletes have a higher prevalence of musculoskeletal      ailments and were not protected from psychosocial distress. This presents an      opportunity for sports medicine physicians and mental health providers to engage       in efforts to rebuild Haiti on an individual level by providing targeted care to       athletes, and on a larger scale, by supporting international sports competition,       which enhances human capital and facilitates public diplomacy.FAU - Yim, Eugene SAU  - Yim ESAD  - 1 Stanford Sports Medicine Center, Stanford Medical School, Stanford, California       USA.FAU - Macy, Robert DAU  - Macy RDAD  - 3 Section of Disaster Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts      USA.FAU - Ciottone, GregoryAU  - Ciottone GAD  - 3 Section of Disaster Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts      USA.LA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20140410PL  - United StatesTA  - Prehosp Disaster MedJT  - Prehospital and disaster medicineJID - 8918173SB  - TMH  - AdolescentMH  - *AltruismMH  - *AthletesMH  - ChildMH  - Cross-Sectional StudiesMH  - *Disaster MedicineMH  - *EarthquakesMH  - FemaleMH  - HaitiMH  - *Health Services Needs and DemandMH  - *Health Status IndicatorsMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - *Sports MedicineEDAT- 2014/04/12 06:00MHDA- 2014/07/01 06:00CRDT- 2014/04/12 06:00PHST- 2014/04/10 [aheadofprint]AID - S1049023X14000302 [pii]AID - 10.1017/S1049023X14000302 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Prehosp Disaster Med. 2014 Apr;29(2):195-9. doi: 10.1017/S1049023X14000302.

In this article, we discuss psychological resilience in sport      performers via a review of the stressors athletes encounter and the protective      factors that help them withstand these demands. It is hoped that synthesising      what is known in these areas will help researchers gain a deeper profundity of      resilience in sport, and also provide a rigorous and robust foundation for the      development of a sport-specific measure of resilience. With these points in mind,      we divided the narrative into two main sections. In the first section, we review       the different types of stressors encountered by sport performers under three main      categories: competitive, organisational and personal. Based on our recent      research examining psychological resilience in Olympics champions, in the second       section we discuss the five main families of psychological factors (viz. positive      personality, motivation, confidence, focus, perceived social support) that      protect the best athletes from the potential negative effect of stressors. It is       anticipated that this review will help sport psychology researchers examine the      interplay between stressors and protective factors, which will, in turn, focus      the analytical lens on the processes underlying psychological resilience in      athletes.FAU - Sarkar, MustafaAU  - Sarkar MAD  - a School of Sport, Exercise, and Health Sciences , Loughborough University ,      Loughborough , UK.FAU - Fletcher, DavidAU  - Fletcher DLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20140409PL  - EnglandTA  - J Sports SciJT  - Journal of sports sciencesJID - 8405364SB  - IMOTO - NOTNLMOT  - athletesOT  - demandsOT  - pressuresOT  - psychological characteristicsOT  - resilient qualitiesOT  - sport performanceEDAT- 2014/04/11 06:00MHDA- 2014/04/11 06:00CRDT- 2014/04/11 06:00PHST- 2014/04/09 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1080/02640414.2014.901551 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Sci. 2014;32(15):1419-34. doi: 10.1080/02640414.2014.901551.

A survey of college strength and conditioning coaches.PG  - 2746-53LID - 10.1519/JSC.0000000000000473 [doi]AB  - Training programs for high school athletes have changed over the last 20 years.      High school physical education classes have transformed into sport-specific      conditioning classes with intensities matching college or professional athlete      programming. In addition, involvement in private, sport-specific, training      increased; but despite these advanced training methods, are high school athletes       prepared for collegiate sport competition? An anonymous survey was sent to 195      Division I strength and conditioning coaches (SCC) to discern incoming college      freshman athletes' physical and psychological preparedness for the rigors of      collegiate training and sport competition. Fifty-seven (29%) responses were      received. Strength and conditioning coaches stated that incoming college freshman      athletes lack lower extremity strength, overall flexibility, and core strength as      well as proper Olympic lifting technique. Strength and conditioning coaches also       stated that athletes lacked the mental toughness to endure collegiate sport      training in addition to claiming incoming athletes lacked knowledge of correct      nutrition and recovery principles. These results suggest a lack of collegiate      training/sport preparedness of high school athletes. High school strength and      conditioning specialist's goal is to produce better athletes and doing so      requires the strength and conditioning coach/trainer to have knowledge of how to       train high school athletes. One way to assure adequate knowledge of strength and       conditioning training principles is for high school coaches/trainers to be      certified in the field. Strength and conditioning certifications among high      school strength and conditioning coaches/trainers would encourage developmentally      appropriate training and would provide universities with athletes who are      prepared for the rigors of collegiate sport training/competition.FAU - Wade, Susan MAU  - Wade SMAD  - 1Equinox, Chicago, IL and Foothills Academy of Sports Training, Boise, Idaho; and      2Department of Kinesiology, Boise State University, Boise, Idaho.FAU - Pope, Zachary CAU  - Pope ZCFAU - Simonson, Shawn RAU  - Simonson SRLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Strength Cond ResJT  - Journal of strength and conditioning research / National Strength & Conditioning       AssociationJID - 9415084SB  - IMEDAT- 2014/04/10 06:00MHDA- 2014/04/10 06:00CRDT- 2014/04/10 06:00AID - 10.1519/JSC.0000000000000473 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Strength Cond Res. 2014 Oct;28(10):2746-53. doi: 10.1519/JSC.0000000000000473.PMID- 24713087OWN - NLMSTAT- In-ProcessDA  - 20140813IS  - 1466-447X (Electronic)IS  - 0264-0414 (Linking)VI  - 32IP  - 15DP  - 2014TI  - Coach-athlete attachment and the quality of the coach-athlete relationship:      implications for athlete's well-being.PG  - 1454-64LID - 10.1080/02640414.2014.898183 [doi]AB  - This study examined whether athletes' attachment styles with the coach were      linked to aspects of the coach-athlete relationship quality and, in turn, whether      relationship quality was linked to athletes' well-being. One hundred and      ninety-two athletes completed a questionnaire measuring their attachment styles      and relationship quality with the coach as well as their feelings of positive      affect (PA) and negative affect (NA). Structural equation modelling (SEM)      analysis found athletes' avoidant and secure attachment styles to be associated      with aspects of coach-athlete relationship quality such as social support,      relationship depth, and interpersonal conflict. Interpersonal conflict appeared      to play a key role in athletes' PA and NA. From a practical perspective, an      understanding of conflict management could provide a resource that allows      athletes (and coaches) to enhance the quality of their sporting relationships.      Specifically, an awareness of proactive strategies (e.g., steps to clarify      expectations) and reactive strategies (e.g., cooperation during the discussion of      disagreements) could potentially lead both coaches and athletes to "broaden"      their viewpoints and in turn "build" connections that are capable of generating      positive emotions including interest, excitement, happiness, and zeal.FAU - Davis, LouiseAU  - Davis LAD  - a Department for Sport , Exercise and Rehabilitation, Northumbria University ,      Newcastle Upon Tyne , UK.FAU - Jowett, SophiaAU  - Jowett SLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20140409PL  - EnglandTA  - J Sports SciJT  - Journal of sports sciencesJID - 8405364SB  - IMOTO - NOTNLMOT  - attachmentOT  - negative affectOT  - positive affectOT  - relationshipsEDAT- 2014/04/10 06:00MHDA- 2014/04/10 06:00CRDT- 2014/04/10 06:00PHST- 2014/04/09 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1080/02640414.2014.898183 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Sci. 2014;32(15):1454-64. doi: 10.1080/02640414.2014.898183.

To enhance the translation of these interventions into widespread use,       research trials must be reported in a way that allows the players, staff and      policymakers associated with sports teams to implement these interventions      effectively. In particular, information is needed on core implementation      components, which represent the essential and indispensable aspects of successful      implementation. OBJECTIVES: To assess the extent to which team ball sport injury       prevention trial reports have reported the core implementation components of the       intervention, the intervention target and the use of any delivery agents (ie,      staff or other personnel delivering the intervention). To summarise which      specific types of intervention, intervention target and delivery agents are      reported. To develop consensus between reviewers on the reporting of these      components. METHODS: Six electronic databases were systematically searched for      English-language, peer-reviewed papers on injury prevention exercise programme      (IPEP) trials in team ball sports. The reporting of all eligible trials was      assessed by two independent reviewers. The reporting of the three core      implementation components were coded as 'yes', 'no' or 'unclear'. For cases coded      as 'yes', the specific types of interventions, intervention targets and delivery       agents were extracted and summarised. RESULTS: The search strategy identified 52       eligible trials. The intervention and the intervention target were reported in      all 52 trials. The reporting of 25 trials (48%) specified the use of delivery      agents, the reporting of three trials (6%) specified not using delivery agents,      and in the reporting of the remaining 24 trials (46%) the use of delivery agents       was unclear. The reported intervention type was an IPEP alone in 43 trials (83%),      education/instruction in how to deliver an IPEP in three trials (6%) and multiple      types of interventions (including an IPEP) in six trials (12%). Players were the       most commonly reported intervention target (88%, n=46), followed by multiple      targets (8%, n=4) and coaches (4%, n=2). Of the 25 trials for which delivery      agents were reported, 13 (52%) reported a single type of delivery agent and 12      (48%) multiple types. The types of delivery agents reported included coaches,      physiotherapists, athletic trainers and team captains. CONCLUSIONS: The current      reporting of core implementation components in team ball sport IPEP trials is      inadequate. In many trial reports, it is unclear whether researchers delivered      the IPEP directly to players themselves or engaged delivery agents (eg, coaches,       physiotherapists, athletic trainers) to deliver the programme. When researchers      do interact with delivery agents, the education/instruction of delivery agents      should be acknowledged as an intervention component and the delivery agents as an      intervention target. Detailed reporting of implementation components in team ball      sport IPEP trials will facilitate the successful replication of these      interventions by intended users in practice and by researchers in other studies.CI  - Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Questionnaires tapping 16 attributes (e.g., teamwork, sportsmanship, level of      competition) and 16 benefits (e.g., good mood, exciting experience, support for      my favorite team) were distributed to a sample of fans at the outdoor broadcast      of the 2010 World Cup final game at the National Stadium in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.      427 participants rated the importance and benefit of each attribute experienced      from watching the game. Attributes were categorized as core, exciting, or hybrid       attributes. The star player was the core attribute; rivalry, popularity, and      coach were the exciting attributes; and the other 12 attributes were hybrid.      Two-dimensional space analyses showed that attributes "sportsmanship, teamwork,      and supporting a team" were both explicitly and implicitly important attributes.       The methodology of asymmetrical analyses can help managers prioritize the focus      of attributes and allocate resources effectively.FAU - Gau, Li-ShiueAU  - Gau LSLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - United StatesTA  - Psychol RepJT  - Psychological reportsJID - 0376475SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - ChildMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Qualitative ResearchMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Sports/*psychologyMH  - TaiwanMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2014/04/04 06:00MHDA- 2014/04/23 06:00CRDT- 2014/04/04 06:00AID - 10.2466/01.05.PR0.113x29z9 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Psychol Rep. 2013 Dec;113(3):786-803.PMID- 24686951OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20140401DCOM- 20141128IS  - 1543-2904 (Electronic)IS  - 0895-2779 (Linking)VI  - 36IP  - 2DP  - 2014 AprTI  - Sources of self-efficacy and coach/instructor behaviors underlying      relation-inferred self-efficacy (RISE) in recreational youth sport.PG  - 146-56LID - 10.1123/jsep.2013-0144 [doi]AB  - Interpersonal feedback from coaches may be instrumental in the formation of      children's self-efficacy to learn or perform sport skills.

This study examined a conditional process model      with team sport athletes' approach-avoidance achievement goals as mediators      between their implicit beliefs of sport ability and sport-related cognitive      anxiety. We expected gender to moderate the paths from implicit beliefs of      ability to approach-avoidance goals and from approach-avoidance goals to      cognitive anxiety. Team sport athletes with a mean age of 20 years (163 females      and 152 males) responded to questionnaires about their implicit beliefs of sport       ability, approach-avoidance goals and sport-related cognitive anxiety.      Incremental beliefs, gender and the interaction between them predicted      mastery-approach goals. Gender also predicted mastery-avoidance goals, with      females reporting higher levels than males. Mastery-avoidance goals, gender and      the interaction between them predicted cognitive anxiety, with females reporting       higher levels of anxiety than males. Entity beliefs positively predicted      performance-avoidance goals and the interaction between performance-approach and       gender predicted anxiety. The indirect effects also showed gender differences in       relation to performance-approach goals. Taken together, our results suggest that       coaches trying to create a facilitating climate for their male and female      athletes may be wise to consider their athletes' anxiety and achievement goal      patterns as these may affect both the athletes' well-being and performance.FAU - Stenling, AndreasAU  - Stenling AAD  - a Department of Psychology , Umea University , Umea , Sweden.FAU - Hassmen, PeterAU  - Hassmen PFAU - Holmstrom, StefanAU  - Holmstrom SLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20140328PL  - EnglandTA  - Eur J Sport SciJT  - European journal of sport scienceJID - 101146739SB  - IMOTO - NOTNLMOT  - MotivationOT  - anxietyOT  - conditional process modelOT  - gender differencesOT  - team sportsEDAT- 2014/04/01 06:00MHDA- 2014/04/01 06:00CRDT- 2014/04/01 06:00PHST- 2014/03/28 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1080/17461391.2014.901419 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur J Sport Sci. 2014;14(7):720-9. doi: 10.1080/17461391.2014.901419.

Personal      deprivation and crises are also major topics in sports media. This paper focuses       on sports biographies as a book genre that is reviving in popularity. The paper      approaches the topic through the biographies of one Danish athlete: the former      professional cyclist, Jesper Skibby, who writes about his doping disclosure and      shares his personal dilemmas as a former elite sportsman. The thematic text      analysis orientates around social interactions, emotions, and personality      constructions. Inspired by microsociology with a Durkheimian flavor of Goffman      and Hochschild, themes including "face work," "interaction rituals," and      "emotions management" are discussed. The analysis claims that sharing personal      information in the media is not only a means of confession and reclaiming status       but is also business and management - on an intimate level. Telling the story of       the corrosion of a sporting character has become a hot issue, an entertainment,      and not least a commercial commitment.CI  - (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The syndrome originally known as the      Female Athlete Triad, which focused on the interaction of energy availability,      reproductive function, and bone health in female athletes, has recently been      expanded to recognize that Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S) has a      broader range of negative effects on body systems with functional impairments in       both male and female athletes. Athletes in leanness-demanding sports have an      increased risk for RED-S and for developing EDs/DE. Special risk factors in      aquatic sports related to weight and body composition management include the      wearing of skimpy and tight-fitting bathing suits, and in the case of diving and       synchronized swimming, the involvement of subjective judgments of performance.      The reported prevalence of DE and EDs in athletic populations, including athletes      from aquatic sports, ranges from 18 to 45% in female athletes and from 0 to 28%      in male athletes. To prevent EDs, aquatic athletes should practice healthy eating      behavior at all periods of development pathway, and coaches and members of the      athletes' health care team should be able to recognize early symptoms indicating       risk for energy deficiency, DE, and EDs. Coaches and leaders must accept that      DE/EDs can be a problem in aquatic disciplines and that openness regarding this      challenge is important.FAU - Melin, AnnaAU  - Melin AAD  - Department of Nutrition, Exercise and Sport, University of Copenhagen,      Frederiksberg, Denmark.FAU - Torstveit, Monica KlunglandAU  - Torstveit MKFAU - Burke, LouiseAU  - Burke LFAU - Marks, SaulAU  - Marks SFAU - Sundgot-Borgen, JorunnAU  - Sundgot-Borgen JLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20140325PL  - United StatesTA  - Int J Sport Nutr Exerc MetabJT  - International journal of sport nutrition and exercise metabolismJID - 100939812SB  - IMEDAT- 2014/03/29 06:00MHDA- 2014/03/29 06:00CRDT- 2014/03/27 06:00PHST- 2014/03/25 [aheadofprint]AID - 2014-0029 [pii]AID - 10.1123/ijsnem.2014-0029 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Int J Sport Nutr Exerc Metab. 2014 Aug;24(4):450-9. doi:      10.1123/ijsnem.2014-0029.

The present study expands knowledge of       athlete leadership by extending the current leadership classification and      exploring the importance of the team captain as formal leader of the team. An      online survey was completed by 4,451 participants (31% females and 69% males)      within nine different team sports in Flanders (Belgium). Players (N = 3,193) and       coaches (N = 1,258) participated on all different levels in their sports. Results      revealed that the proposed additional role of motivational leader was perceived      as clearly distinct from the already established roles (task, social and external      leader). Furthermore, almost half of the participants (44%) did not perceive      their captain as the principal leader on any of the four roles. These findings      underline the fact that the leadership qualities attributed to the captain as the      team's formal leader are overrated. It can be concluded that leadership is spread      throughout the team; informal leaders rather than the captain take the lead, both      on and off the field.FAU - Fransen, KatrienAU  - Fransen KAD  - a KU Leuven , Department of Kinesiology , Leuven , Belgium.FAU - Vanbeselaere, NorbertAU  - Vanbeselaere NFAU - De Cuyper, BertAU  - De Cuyper BFAU - Vande Broek, GertAU  - Vande Broek GFAU - Boen, FilipAU  - Boen FLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20140324PL  - EnglandTA  - J Sports SciJT  - Journal of sports sciencesJID - 8405364SB  - IMOTO - NOTNLMOT  - informal leadershipOT  - peer leadersOT  - shared leadershipOT  - sport psychologyOT  - team performanceEDAT- 2014/03/26 06:00MHDA- 2014/03/26 06:00CRDT- 2014/03/26 06:00PHST- 2014/03/24 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1080/02640414.2014.891291 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Sci. 2014;32(14):1389-97. doi: 10.1080/02640414.2014.891291.

Protective devices can make this possible. The risks of returning to play in this      manner depend on many factors including the injury itself, position played, hand       dominance, etc. Communication between treating health care professional, athlete,      trainer, and coaches is critical in this decision process. Protective options      include taping, custom-made splints, commercially available braces, soft casts,      and hard casts. Ability to use these devices during competition is governed by      the rules of each individual sport and often dependent on final approval by      referee or game official.FAU - Almekinders, Louis CAU  - Almekinders LCAD  - *North Carolina Orthopaedic Clinic, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery      daggerDepartment of Orthopaedic Surgery, Duke University Health System double      daggerDivision of Athletic Medicine, Duke University, Durham, NC.FAU - Tao, Matthew AAU  - Tao MAFAU - Zarzour, RobertAU  - Zarzour RLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Sports Med ArthroscJT  - Sports medicine and arthroscopy reviewJID - 9315689SB  - IMMH  - Athletic Injuries/*therapyMH  - Athletic TapeMH  - BracesMH  - Casts, SurgicalMH  - Hand Injuries/*therapyMH  - HumansMH  - Immobilization/*methodsMH  - *Protective DevicesMH  - SplintsMH  - Wrist Injuries/*therapyEDAT- 2014/03/22 06:00MHDA- 2014/11/19 06:00CRDT- 2014/03/22 06:00AID - 10.1097/JSA.0000000000000010 [doi]AID - 00132585-201403000-00009 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Sports Med Arthrosc. 2014 Mar;22(1):66-70. doi: 10.1097/JSA.0000000000000010.PMID- 24647854OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20140520DCOM- 20141231IS  - 1179-2035 (Electronic)IS  - 0112-1642 (Linking)VI  - 44IP  - 6DP  - 2014 JunTI  - Factors affecting sports-related orofacial injuries and the importance of      mouthguards.PG  - 777-83LID - 10.1007/s40279-014-0167-9 [doi]AB  - Sports dentistry is one of the most recent and upcoming fields in dentistry. It      includes mainly the prevention and management of sports-related orofacial      injuries and associated oral diseases or traumas. The dentist can play a critical      role in informing athletes, coaches, and patients and their parents about the      importance of prevention, treatment, and diagnosis for orofacial injuries in      sports. The most significant aspect in preventing sports-related orofacial      injuries is wearing basic protective devices such as properly fitting helmets,      face masks, and/or mouthguards. A properly fitted mouthguard prevents violent      contact between the upper and lower dentition. According to the American Society       for Testing and Materials, there are three types of mouthguards:      custom-fabricated mouthguards, mouth-formed guards, and stock mouthguards.      Essential properties of the various materials used in the manufacture of      mouthguards include water absorption, density, and thickness as well as      temperature transmission, energy absorption, and drawing strength (tensile      strength) of custom-made mouthguards. Currently, a variety of materials is being       used for mouthguards, most commonly polyvinyl acetate-polyethylene copolymer or      ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer and polyvinyl chloride. Mouthguard use is      significant for athletes, since dentists play an important role in the design and      application of these in clinical practice. The purpose of this article is to      review the importance of mouthguard use, the incidence and location of orofacial       sports injuries, the risk factors for such injuries, and the types of mouthguards      and their roles in the prevention of sports-related orofacial injuries.FAU - Tuna, Elif BaharAU  - Tuna EBAD  - Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Faculty of Dentistry, Istanbul University,      Millet Street, Capa, Istanbul, 34093, Turkey, ebtuna@istanbul.edu.tr.FAU - Ozel, EmreAU  - Ozel ELA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - New ZealandTA  - Sports MedJT  - Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)JID - 8412297SB  - IMMH  - Age FactorsMH  - Athletic Injuries/epidemiology/*prevention & controlMH  - Equipment DesignMH  - Facial Injuries/epidemiology/*prevention & controlMH  - HumansMH  - IncidenceMH  - Mouth/*injuriesMH  - *Mouth ProtectorsMH  - Risk FactorsEDAT- 2014/03/22 06:00MHDA- 2015/01/01 06:00CRDT- 2014/03/21 06:00AID - 10.1007/s40279-014-0167-9 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Sports Med. 2014 Jun;44(6):777-83. doi: 10.1007/s40279-014-0167-9.PMID- 24644512OWN - NLMSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINEDA  - 20140319DCOM- 20140319LR  - 20140731IS  - 1735-8639 (Print)IS  - 1735-8639 (Linking)VI  - 7IP  - 2DP  - 2013 FallTI  - The Relationship between Coaches' and Athletes' Competitive Anxiety,and their      Performance.PG  - 68-76AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to survey the relationship between coaches'      and athletes' competitive anxiety, and their performance. METHODS: This is a      descriptive correlational study performed using a demographic questionnaire, an      athletic performance checklist, and sport competition anxiety test designed by      Martens consisting of 15 questions. The study population consisted of 540 players      and 60 coaches from 60 futsal teams (5 main players, 4 reserves, and 1 coach for       each team). All of the players and the coaches were surveyed in a census method      and no sampling was done. The data were analyzed by SPSS software, using      chi-square, and Pearson correlation coefficient test. RESULTS: The results showed      a positive significant relationship between the coaches' anxiety level and sport       competition anxiety level in the athletes (p = 0.019, r = 0.56). It also showed      that there was a negative significant relationship between the coaches' anxiety      level and performance level of the athletes (p = 0.012, r = -0.80). A negative      significant relationship was also demonstrated between the athletes' competitive       anxiety level, and their athletic experiences (p < 0.001, r = -0.45) and age (p =      0.001, r = -0.37). CONCLUSIONS: Coaches and officials should consider sport      competition anxiety among athletes before and during competitions. Formal and      planned competitions, training sessions, and preparation practices can be a major      factor assisting to decrease athletes' anxiety.

Their      motivation may be intrinsic or due to coach and team pressures. The sports      medicine physician plays an important role to risk-manage the health of the      competing athlete in partnership with the coach and other members of the support       team. The sports medicine physician needs to strike the right ethical and      operational balance between health management and optimising performance. It is      necessary to revisit the popular delivery model of sports medicine and science      services to elite athletes based on the current reductionist multispecialist      system lacking in practice an integrated approach and effective communication.      Athlete and coach in isolation or with a member of the multidisciplinary support       team, often not qualified or experienced to do so, decide on the utilisation of      services and how to apply the recommendations. We propose a new Integrated      Performance Health Management and Coaching model based on the UK Athletics      experience in preparation for the London Olympic and Paralympic Games. The      Medical and Coaching Teams are managed by qualified and experienced individuals      operating in synergy towards a common performance goal, accountable to a      Performance Director and ultimately to the Board of Directors. We describe the      systems, processes and implementation strategies to assist the athlete, coach and      support teams to continuously monitor and manage athlete health and performance.       These systems facilitate a balanced approach to training and competing decisions,      especially while the athlete is ill or injured. They take into account the best      medical advice and athlete preference. This Integrated Performance Health      Management and Coaching model underpinned the Track and Field Gold Medal      performances at the London Olympic and Paralympic Games.FAU - Dijkstra, H PaulAU  - Dijkstra HPAD  - Sports Medicine Department, Aspetar, Qatar Orthopaedic and Sports Medicine      Hospital, , Doha, Qatar.FAU - Pollock, NAU  - Pollock NFAU - Chakraverty, RAU  - Chakraverty RFAU - Alonso, J MAU  - Alonso JMLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - EnglandTA  - Br J Sports MedJT  - British journal of sports medicineJID - 0432520SB  - IMMH  - *AthletesMH  - Athletic Performance/physiologyMH  - Delivery of Health Care/methodsMH  - Electronic Health RecordsMH  - HumansMH  - Models, BiologicalMH  - PamphletsMH  - Patient Care Team/organization & administrationMH  - Patient Education as Topic/methodsMH  - Patient-Centered CareMH  - Physical Education and Training/methodsMH  - Physician's RoleMH  - Physician-Patient RelationsMH  - Social ResponsibilityMH  - *SportsMH  - Sports Medicine/*methodsPMC - PMC3963533OID - NLM: PMC3963533OTO - NOTNLMOT  - AthleticsOT  - Elite PerformanceOT  - EthicsEDAT- 2014/03/13 06:00MHDA- 2014/11/15 06:00CRDT- 2014/03/13 06:00AID - 48/7/523 [pii]AID - 10.1136/bjsports-2013-093222 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Br J Sports Med. 2014 Apr;48(7):523-31. doi: 10.1136/bjsports-2013-093222.PMID- 24611244OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20140311DCOM- 20140418IS  - 0031-5125 (Print)IS  - 0031-5125 (Linking)VI  - 117IP  - 2DP  - 2013 OctTI  - Variables affecting athletes' retention of coaches' feedback.PG  - 389-401AB  - Athletes' retention of information conveyed in coaches' feedback during training       was examined, considering the nature of the information transmitted by each coach      (extensions, total number of ideas transmitted, and total number of repeated      ideas), athletes' characteristics, (ages, genders, school levels, and practice      levels), and athletes' perceptions (relevance and acceptance of coaches'      information, task motivational levels, and athletes' attention levels).

Athletes' mean per-episode information retention was 63.0%. Three      variables appeared to b e predictiveathletes' retention: athletes' practice      levels (p = -.25), attention to coaches' provision of feedback (P = .17), and the      number of different ideas transmitted by each coach (P = -.90).FAU - Januario, Nuno M SAU  - Januario NMFAU - Rosado, Antonio FAU  - Rosado AFFAU - Mesquita, IsabelAU  - Mesquita ILA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - United StatesTA  - Percept Mot SkillsJT  - Perceptual and motor skillsJID - 0401131SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Athletes/education/*psychologyMH  - ChildMH  - Feedback, Psychological/*physiologyMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - Learning/*physiologyMH  - MaleMH  - Mental Recall/physiologyMH  - Motivation/physiologyMH  - Retention (Psychology)/*physiologyMH  - Sports/educationEDAT- 2014/03/13 06:00MHDA- 2014/04/20 06:00CRDT- 2014/03/12 06:00AID - 10.2466/22.10.PMS.117x16z7 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Percept Mot Skills. 2013 Oct;117(2):389-401.PMID- 24602719OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20140307DCOM- 20141110IS  - 1878-7452 (Electronic)IS  - 1878-7452 (Linking)VI  - 71IP  - 2DP  - 2014 Mar-AprTI  - What surgeons can learn from athletes: mental practice in sports and surgery.PG  - 262-9LID - 10.1016/j.jsurg.2013.07.002 [doi]LID - S1931-7204(13)00188-8 [pii]AB  - BACKGROUND: Mental practice has been successfully applied in professional sports       for skills acquisition and performance enhancement. The goals of this review are       to describe the literature on mental practice within sport psychology and surgery      and to explore how the specific principles of mental practice can be applied to      the improvement of surgical performance-both in novice and expert surgeons.      METHOD: The authors reviewed the sports psychology, education, and surgery      literatures through Medline, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase. RESULTS: In sports,      mental practice is a valuable tool for optimizing existing motor skill sets once       core competencies have been mastered. These techniques have been shown to be more      advantageous when used by elite athletes. Within surgery, mental practice studies      have focused on skill acquisition among novices with little study of how expert      surgeons use it to optimize surgical preparation. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that      performance optimization and skills acquisition should be viewed as 2 separate      domains of mental practice. Further understanding of this phenomenon has      implications for changing how we teach and train not only novice surgeons but      also how experienced surgeons continue to maintain their skills, acquire new      ones, and excel in surgery.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.

METHODS: We analyzed baseline      survey data from the "Coaching Boys into Men" study-a school-based      cluster-randomized trial in 16 high schools in Northern California. We describe      relationships among gender-inequitable attitudes, sport type, and recent      adolescent relationship abuse perpetration among a sample of male athletes (n =      1,648). RESULTS: Gender-inequitable attitudes (adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 3.26;      95% confidence interval (CI), 2.56, 4.15), participation in both high school      football and basketball (AOR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.37, 3.18), and participation in      football only (AOR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.02, 2.22) emerged as independently associated      with recent ARA perpetration. CONCLUSIONS: Findings warrant targeted violence      prevention efforts among male high school athletes that incorporate discussions      of gender attitudes and healthy relationships, especially among sports teams at      greater risk of adolescent relationship abuse perpetration.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

To prevent an inappropriate return to play      while symptomatic, nearly all states have now passed legislation on youth      sports-related concussions. PURPOSE: To determine (1) the incidence of      sports-related concussions in high school athletes using a unique system to      collect reports on concussions, (2) the proportion of athletes with concussions      who play with concussive symptoms, and (3) the effect of the type and modality of      coach education on the likelihood of athletes reporting symptoms to the coach or       playing with concussive symptoms. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence,       2. METHODS: This study was conducted with high school football and girls' soccer       athletes playing in fall 2012 and their coaches and parents in 20 urban or rural       high schools in Washington State. The main outcome was the incidence of      concussions per 1000 athlete-exposures (AEs), the proportion of concussed      athletes who played with concussive symptoms, and the association of coach      concussion education with coach awareness of athletes with concussive symptoms.      RESULTS: Among the 778 athletes, the rate of concussions was 3.6 per 1000 AEs and      was identical for the 2 sports studied. The cumulative concussion incidence over       the course of the season was similar in girls' soccer (11.1%) and football      (10.4%). Sixty-nine percent of concussed athletes reported playing with symptoms,      and 40% reported that their coach was not aware of their concussion. Most      measures of coach concussion education were not associated with coach awareness      of concussions in their athletes, although the modalities of a video and quiz      were associated with a lower likelihood of coach awareness. CONCLUSION: More      objective and accurate methods are needed to identify concussions. Changes in      athlete attitudes on reporting concussive symptoms will likely not be      accomplished through legislation alone.FAU - Rivara, Frederick PAU  - Rivara FPAD  - Frederick P.

Previous research indicates that translating the Mayday      Safety Procedure into practice among community rugby coaches is challenging. This      study investigated whether Mayday Safety Procedure translation could be enhanced       by systematically planning and implementing a range of theory-informed and      context-specific diffusion strategies. DESIGN: A controlled before-and-after      study. METHODS: Coaches of senior community rugby teams in five zones in New      South Wales (Australia) were invited to complete a questionnaire about their      Mayday Safety Procedure knowledge and practice at the end of the 2010 and 2011      rugby seasons. During 2011, coaches in the intervention zone were exposed to a      range of strategies to promote Mayday Safety Procedure diffusion which were      planned by following Step 5 of the Intervention Mapping protocol. Coaches in the       other four zones were exposed to usual strategies to promote Mayday Safety      Procedure diffusion. RESULTS: Using the RE-AIM evaluation framework,      statistically significant improvements were found among intervention zone coaches      in: knowledge of most Mayday Safety Procedure key criteria; the number of coaches      recognising their zone policy requiring them to train players in the Mayday      Safety Procedure; frequency of provision of Mayday Safety Procedure training to      players; coach perceptions of the quality of Mayday Safety Procedure training for      players; and in confidence that referees could implement the Mayday Safety      Procedure during a game if required. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the      translation of injury prevention policy into community practice can be enhanced      by developing and implementing a theory-informed, context-specific diffusion      plan, undertaken in partnership with key stakeholders.CI  - Copyright (c) 2014 Sports Medicine Australia.

Eighty competitive athletes      (44 males and 36 females; 21.89 +/- 1.48 years of age; 8.35 +/- 3.65 years of      competitive experience) from the University School of Physical Education in      Cracow, Poland, participated in the study. They represented both individual (n =       50) and team sports (n = 30). Seventeen participants were internationally      renowned and 63 were recognized for competitive excellence at a national level.      The participants responded to a demographic survey and the Coaches' Behaviors      Survey. The qualitative analysis procedures were employed to extract themes from       open-ended questions. It was confirmed that coaches who perceived their athletes       as more skilled, also treated them differently. Female athletes as compared with       male athletes, more frequently pointed at the leniency in coach's behavior      towards highly skilled athletes, and perceived it as a factor inhibiting athletic      development. Additionally, women often found individualization of the training      process as a behavior reinforcing development. Less accomplished athletes more      often pointed out to "a post-training session interest in the athlete" as      directed only towards more accomplished counterparts; however, they indicated      "leniency and favoring" less often than the athletes with international      achievements. They also listed "excessive criticism" as a type of behavior      hindering development, but they indicated coaches' "authoritarianism and      distance" less frequently than the more accomplished counterparts. The study      added data to the discussion of the Pygmalion effect and the phenomenon of the      self-fulfilling prophecy both in general (Rosenthal and Jacobson, 1968; Harris      and Rosenthal, 1985; Jussim, 1989) and sport psychology (Harris and Rosenthal,      1985; Horn et al., 1998; Solomon and Kosmitzki, 1996; Solomon et al., 1998;      Solomon, 2001).FAU - Siekanska, MalgorzataAU  - Siekanska MAD  - Department of Psychology, University School of Physical Education in Cracow,      Poland.FAU - Blecharz, JanAU  - Blecharz JAD  - Department of Psychology, University School of Physical Education in Cracow,      Poland.FAU - Wojtowicz, AgnieszkaAU  - Wojtowicz AAD  - Department of Psychology, University School of Physical Education in Cracow,      Poland.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20131231PL  - PolandTA  - J Hum KinetJT  - Journal of human kineticsJID - 101513031PMC - PMC3916925OID - NLM: PMC3916925OTO - NOTNLMOT  - perception of coaches’ behaviorsOT  - self-fulfilling prophecyOT  - the Pygmalion effect in sportEDAT- 2014/02/11 06:00MHDA- 2014/02/11 06:01CRDT- 2014/02/11 06:00PHST- 2013/12/18 [ecollection]PHST- 2013/12/31 [epublish]AID - 10.2478/hukin-2013-0086 [doi]AID - jhk-39-231 [pii]PST - epublishSO  - J Hum Kinet. 2013 Dec 31;39:231-42. doi: 10.2478/hukin-2013-0086. eCollection      2013 Dec 18.PMID- 24510067OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20140505DCOM- 20141103IS  - 1552-3365 (Electronic)IS  - 0363-5465 (Linking)VI  - 42IP  - 5DP  - 2014 MayTI  - Implementation of concussion legislation and extent of concussion education for      athletes, parents, and coaches in Washington State.PG  - 1190-6LID - 10.1177/0363546513519073 [doi]AB  - BACKGROUND: Most states in the United States have passed laws regarding      concussions, but little is known regarding the implementation of these laws.      Hypothesis/ PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to survey high school coaches       3 years after the passage of a concussion law to evaluate the variation in      concussion education and knowledge in the context of this law as well as measure       the effects of sport (football vs soccer) and urban versus rural locations. The      hypothesis was that concussion education and knowledge would be more extensive in      football compared with soccer and in urban locations compared with rural      locations. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive epidemiology study. METHODS: A mixed-methods      (paper and online) survey was conducted in 2012 to 2013 on a random sample of      public high school football, girls' soccer, and boys' soccer coaches in      Washington State, stratified by urban and rural locality. The survey covered the       extent of concussion education for coaches, athletes, and parents as well as      coaches' concussion knowledge and experience. RESULTS: Of 496 coaches contacted,       270 responded (54.4%). Nearly all coaches answered concussion knowledge questions      correctly, and nearly all coaches received education via >/=2 modalities      (written, video, slide presentation, test, and in person). Athlete education was       less extensive, with 34.7% exposed to >/=2 modalities and 29.5% only signing a      concussion information form. Parent education was even more limited, with 16.2%      exposed to >/=2 modalities and 57.9% only signing a concussion information form.       Significantly more football than soccer coaches gave their athletes an in-person       talk about concussions (59.1% vs. 39.4%, respectively; P = .002) and provided      concussion education to athletes via >/=2 modalities (44.1% vs. 29.7%,      respectively; P = .02). Concussion education for coaches and parents was similar       between sports, and concussion education for all parties was similar in urban and      rural localities. CONCLUSION: Three years after the passage of a concussion law      in Washington State, high school football and soccer coaches are receiving      substantial concussion education and have good concussion knowledge. Concussion      education for athletes and parents is more limited. Football players receive more      extensive concussion education than do soccer players.

In Study 1, 335 individual-sport athletes (Mage = 17.32, SD = 1.38)      completed instruments assessing affective, normative, and continuance commitment       to their relationship with their coach, and in Study 2, contextually modified      instruments were administered to assess interdependent-sport athletes' (N = 286,       Mage = 16.31, SD = 1.33) commitment to their team. Bayesian structural equation      modeling revealed support for a three-factor (in comparison with a single-factor)      model, along with relations between commitment dimensions and relevant correlates      (e.g., satisfaction, return intentions, cohesion) that were largely consistent      with theory. Guided by recent advancements in Bayesian modeling, these studies      provide a new commitment instrument with the potential for use and refinement in       team- and relationship-based settings and offer preliminary support for a      conceptual framework that may help advance our understanding of the factors      underpinning individuals' engagement in sport.FAU - Jackson, BenAU  - Jackson BAD  - School of Sport Science, Exercise and Health, University of Western Australia,      Crawley, WA, Australia.FAU - Gucciardi, Daniel FAU  - Gucciardi DFFAU - Dimmock, James AAU  - Dimmock JALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - United StatesTA  - J Sport Exerc PsycholJT  - Journal of sport & exercise psychologyJID - 8809258SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Adolescent Behavior/*psychologyMH  - Affect/physiologyMH  - Athletes/*psychologyMH  - Bayes TheoremMH  - FemaleMH  - Group ProcessesMH  - HumansMH  - IntentionMH  - *Interpersonal RelationsMH  - MaleMH  - Personal SatisfactionMH  - Sports/*psychologyEDAT- 2014/02/07 06:00MHDA- 2014/10/15 06:00CRDT- 2014/02/07 06:00AID - 10.1123/jsep.2013-0038 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sport Exerc Psychol. 2014 Feb;36(1):52-68. doi: 10.1123/jsep.2013-0038.PMID- 24456303OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20140410DCOM- 20141203IS  - 1532-530X (Electronic)IS  - 1064-0266 (Linking)VI  - 22IP  - 3DP  - 2014TI  - Gender differences in high school coaches' knowledge, attitudes, and      communication about the female athlete triad.PG  - 193-208LID - 10.1080/10640266.2013.874827 [doi]AB  - The objective of this study was to assess high school coaches' knowledge,      attitudes, communication, and management decisions with respect to the Female      Athlete Triad and to determine whether results are patterned by coach gender.

However, the      reliability of such subjective assessments has yet to be investigated via      appropriate statistical techniques. Therefore, the aims of the current study were      to investigate: (1) the intra-observer reliability of a non-qualified observer      ('novice') and (2) the inter-observer reliability of the three observers (two      qualified 'experts' and one novice observer) in the assessment of catching,      passing and tackling (stages 1 and 2) ability in elite adolescent rugby league      players (age: 14.7 +/- 0.5 years). Players performed each skill element within a       simulated practice drill and were assessed in 'real time' by the observers      according to pre-defined criteria. An overall bias (P<0.05) was revealed between       the observers in stage 1 of catching and stage 1 of passing, the differences      being higher for the novice compared to both expert coaches for each stage of      catching and the first stage of passing, and between expert 2 and the novice for       stage 2 of tackling. No comparisons met the pre-determined analytical goal of      'perfect agreement', for any of the skill components. Comparisons between the      expert observers did not reach perfect agreement, with the lowest values      occurring for both tackling skill stages (60-65%). None of the tests employed      were sufficiently reliable to potentially discern between players of differing      ability, which may mean up to 56% of players' skill being misinterpreted. The      credibility of such assessments should be questioned and alternative tests      considered.FAU - Waldron, MarkAU  - Waldron MAD  - a Sports and Exercise Sciences , University of Chester , Chester , UK.FAU - Worsfold, PaulAU  - Worsfold PFAU - Twist, CraigAU  - Twist CFAU - Lamb, KevinAU  - Lamb KLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20120810PL  - EnglandTA  - Eur J Sport SciJT  - European journal of sport scienceJID - 101146739SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Athletes/*statistics & numerical dataMH  - Athletic Performance/physiology/*statistics & numerical dataMH  - Football/physiology/*statistics & numerical dataMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Reproducibility of ResultsMH  - *Task Performance and AnalysisEDAT- 2014/01/22 06:00MHDA- 2014/09/25 06:00CRDT- 2014/01/22 06:00PHST- 2012/08/10 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1080/17461391.2012.714405 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur J Sport Sci. 2014;14 Suppl 1:S471-7. doi: 10.1080/17461391.2012.714405.

The study was conducted on a random selection of      627 male participants (404 amateur/semi-professional footballers, 101 coaches and      122 referees) that regularly train/compete on artificial turf in Spanish football      leagues. The results of the skin abrasion, muscle strain and the possibility of      sustaining an injury, on a Likert-type 10-point interval scale, gave a perception      of 'somewhat dissatisfied' for the participants. The main advantages of      artificial turf were their sports features, the evenness of the surface and the      good state of conservation. Participants were satisfied with the artificial turf       surface. Approximately three out of four participants gave an overall ranking of       highly satisfied. The players were significantly less satisfied than the coaches       and referees. The overall satisfaction with artificial turf fields was strongly      influenced by previous experience, particularly those who had previously played      on dirt pitches. These results highlight the versatility of artificial turf to      adapt to any circumstance or requirement for local sport and top-level      professional competitions alike.FAU - Burillo, PabloAU  - Burillo PAD  - a Sport Science Institute, Camilo Jose Cela University , Madrid , Spain.FAU - Gallardo, LeonorAU  - Gallardo LFAU - Felipe, Jose LuisAU  - Felipe JLFAU - Gallardo, Ana MariaAU  - Gallardo AMLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20120810PL  - EnglandTA  - Eur J Sport SciJT  - European journal of sport scienceJID - 101146739SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - Athletic Performance/psychologyMH  - Consumer Behavior/*statistics & numerical dataMH  - *Floors and FloorcoveringsMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - PerceptionMH  - Soccer/*psychologyMH  - SpainMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2014/01/22 06:00MHDA- 2014/09/25 06:00CRDT- 2014/01/22 06:00PHST- 2012/08/10 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1080/17461391.2012.713005 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur J Sport Sci. 2014;14 Suppl 1:S437-47. doi: 10.1080/17461391.2012.713005.

Little is known regarding the utilization of ankle injury prevention strategies      in high school settings. OBJECTIVE: To determine high school basketball coaches'       utilization of ankle injury prevention strategies, including prophylactic ankle      bracing (PAB) or an ankle injury prevention exercise program (AIEPP). STUDY      DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. METHODS: The survey was distributed to all high      school basketball coaches in Wisconsin. Fisher exact and Wilcoxon rank sum tests       were used to determine if the injury prevention strategies utilized differed      according to school size, sex of the team, years of coaching experience, and the       coach's education level. RESULTS: Four hundred eighty (55%) coaches from 299      (74%) high schools completed the survey. Thirty-seven percent of the coaches      encouraged or required their players to use PAB. School enrollment of the      coaches' teams did not affect their stance on the use of PAB (P = 0.30), neither       did the sex of the team (P = 0.16), years coaching (P = 0.09), nor the coach's      education (P = 0.49). Fifty percent (n = 242) of the coaches indicated they do      not utilize an AIEPP, with no difference based on school enrollment (P = 0.47),      team sex (P = 0.41), years coaching (P = 0.78), or the education level (P =      0.44). Barriers to utilization of AIEPP included a lack of time, awareness, and      expertise. Coaches preferred an AIEPP that was specific to basketball, combined      injury prevention and performance enhancement components, was performed 2 to 3      days per week, and lasted 5 to 15 minutes. CONCLUSION: Less than half of the      coaches encouraged use of PAB, and half did not utilize an AIEPP. Coaches had      specific preferences for the type of AIEPP they would implement. CLINICAL      RELEVANCE: Sports medicine providers should promote ankle injury prevention      strategies but need to address why prevention strategies may not be utilized in      high school basketball settings.FAU - McGuine, Timothy AAU  - McGuine TAAD  - University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin.FAU - Hetzel, ScottAU  - Hetzel SAD  - University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin.FAU - Pennuto, AnthonyAU  - Pennuto AAD  - University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin.FAU - Brooks, AlisonAU  - Brooks AAD  - University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin.LA  - engGR  - K12 HD055894/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Sports HealthJT  - Sports healthJID - 101518422PMC - PMC3752192OID - NLM: PMC3752192OTO - NOTNLMOT  - ankle injuryOT  - basketballOT  - high schoolOT  - preventionEDAT- 2014/01/16 06:00MHDA- 2014/01/16 06:01CRDT- 2014/01/16 06:00AID - 10.1177/1941738113491072 [doi]AID - 10.1177_1941738113491072 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Sports Health. 2013 Sep;5(5):410-6. doi: 10.1177/1941738113491072.PMID- 24427398OWN - NLMSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINEDA  - 20140115DCOM- 20140115LR  - 20140507IS  - 1941-7381 (Print)IS  - 1941-0921 (Linking)VI  - 5IP  - 3DP  - 2013 MayTI  - Concussion Management, Education, and Return-to-Play Policies in High Schools: A       Survey of Athletic Directors, Athletic Trainers, and Coaches.PG  - 258-62LID - 10.1177/1941738113476850 [doi]AB  - BACKGROUND: Concussions represent 8.9% to 13.2% of all high school athletic      injuries. How these injuries are managed is currently unknown. HYPOTHESIS: There       are differences in concussion management and awareness among boys football, boys       ice hockey, and boys and girls soccer. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive epidemiologic      study. METHODS: High school athletic directors were contacted via e-mail and      asked to complete, and request that their staff complete, an online survey with 4      sections aimed at athletic directors, head coaches, team physicians, and      certified athletic trainers. RESULTS: According to coaches, concussion awareness       education was provided for football (97%), hockey (65%), and boys and girls      soccer (57% and 47%, respectively) (P < 0.01). Use of sideline screening tools      was significantly greater for football (P = 0.03). All participants agreed that a      player who has suffered a concussion cannot return to play the same day.      CONCLUSION: There is a difference in concussion management and awareness among      the 4 sports. Concussion education is well promoted in football but should be      expanded in soccer and hockey. Players are not allowed to return to play the same      day, and the majority are referred to a physician. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Study      results highlight the differences in concussion education among sports.

Additionally, the KSNand KD questionnaires were evaluated      for their reliability and validity. Altogether, 82 athletes (17.2 +/- 1.92 years       of age) and 28 coaches (30.8 +/- 5.26 years of age) from Croatia and Serbia were       included in the study, with a 99% response rate. The testand retest correlations       were 0.94 and 0.90 for the KD and KSN,respectively. Subjects responded equally to      91% queries of the KD and 89% queries of the KSN. Although most of the coache      sare highly educated, they declared self-education as the primary source of      information about doping and sport-nutrition. Coaches scored higher than their      athletes on both questionnaires which defined appropriate discriminative validity      of the questionnaires. Variables such as age, sports experience and formal      education are positively correlated to KSN and KD scores among athletes. The      athletes who scored better on the KD are less prone to doping behavior in the      future. These data reinforce the need for systematic educational programs on      doping and sports nutrition in synchronized swimming. Special attention should be      placed on younger athletes. Key PointsAlthough most of the synchro coaches are      highly educated, self-education is declared as the primary source of information       about doping and sportnutrition.The knowledge of doping and doping-health hazards      are negatively related to potential doping behavior in the future among      synchronized swimmersThe data reinforce the need for systematic educational      programs on doping and sports nutrition in synchronized swimming.We advocate      improving the knowledge of sports nutrition among older coaches and the knowledge      of doping among younger coaches, while among athletes,younger swimmers should be       targeted.FAU - Furjan Mandic, GordanaAU  - Furjan Mandic GAD  - University of Zagreb, Faculty of Kinesiology , Zagreb, Croatia ;FAU - Peric, MiaAU  - Peric MAD  - University of Split, Faculty of Kinesiology, , Split, Croatia;FAU - Krzelj, LucijanaAU  - Krzelj LAD  - Sunce Polyclinics, , Sunce VHI, Split, Croatia;FAU - Stankovic, SladanaAU  - Stankovic SAD  - University of Kragujevac, , Faculty of Pedagogy, Jagodina.FAU - Zenic, NatasaAU  - Zenic NAD  - University of Split, Faculty of Kinesiology, , Split, Croatia;LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20131201PL  - TurkeyTA  - J Sports Sci MedJT  - Journal of sports science & medicineJID - 101174629PMC - PMC3873667OID - NLM: PMC3873667OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Dietary supplementsOT  - knowledgeOT  - reliabilityOT  - validityEDAT- 2014/01/15 06:00MHDA- 2014/01/15 06:01CRDT- 2014/01/15 06:00PHST- 2013/12 [ecollection]PHST- 2013/12/28 [received]PHST- 2013/11/07 [accepted]PHST- 2013/12/01 [epublish]PST - epublishSO  - J Sports Sci Med. 2013 Dec 1;12(4):753-60. eCollection 2013.PMID- 24420807OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20140203DCOM- 20140401IS  - 1098-4275 (Electronic)IS  - 0031-4005 (Linking)VI  - 133IP  - 2DP  - 2014 FebTI  - Bullying behavior by athletic coaches.PG  - e273-5LID - 10.1542/peds.2013-3146 [doi]FAU - Swigonski, Nancy LAU  - Swigonski NLAD  - Children's Health Services Research, Indiana University School of Medicine,      Indianapolis, Indiana; and.FAU - Enneking, Brett AAU  - Enneking BAFAU - Hendrix, Kristin SAU  - Hendrix KSLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20140113PL  - United StatesTA  - PediatricsJT  - PediatricsJID - 0376422SB  - AIMSB  - IMMH  - *BullyingMH  - ChildMH  - HumansMH  - *SportsOTO - NOTNLMOT  - athletesOT  - athletic coachOT  - bullyingOT  - verbal abuseOT  - youth sportsEDAT- 2014/01/15 06:00MHDA- 2014/04/02 06:00CRDT- 2014/01/15 06:00PHST- 2014/01/13 [aheadofprint]AID - peds.2013-3146 [pii]AID - 10.1542/peds.2013-3146 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Pediatrics. 2014 Feb;133(2):e273-5. doi: 10.1542/peds.2013-3146.

OBJECTIVE: The primary purpose of this study was to determine if the quality of      friendships, physical self-perceptions and general self-worth predicted close      friendship, loneliness and social acceptance among 46 athletes with physical      disabilities (males = 35, female = 11) between the ages of 12 and 21 (M age =      15.37, SD = 2.45). Second, this study examined descriptive information on the      quality of friendships inside and outside of an adapted sport setting, feelings      of loneliness, social acceptance, close friendships, athletic competence,      physical appearance, and self-worth among youth athletes with physical      disabilities. METHODS: Participants completed the Sport Friendship Quality Scale       (SFQS), a Loneliness Rating Scale and the Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents      (SPPA). RESULTS: Three regression analyses used positive and negative aspects of       non-sport friendship quality, positive aspects of sport friendship quality,      physical appearance, athletic competence, and self-worth as predictors and      accounted for 57%, 41%, and 31% of the variance in loneliness, close friendships,      and social acceptance, respectively. Athletic competence and self-worth were the       most important predictors of loneliness and close friendships with significant (p      < .10) beta weights. No single predictor had a significant beta weight in      predicting social acceptance. Negative and positive elements of friendship      quality were not important predictors. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the       importance of global psychological (i.e., self-worth) and sport specific      psychological (i.e., athletic competence) constructs in predicting important      social well-being indices (i.e., close friendships & loneliness).CI  - Published by Elsevier Inc.FAU - Shapiro, Deborah RAU  - Shapiro DRAD  - Department of Kinesiology and Health, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, USA.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted       with a convenience sample of 15 Catalan professional coaches (3 women and 12 men,      3 each from the following sports: volleyball, basketball, handball, soccer, and      water polo) to gain their views of three perceived effort-related dimensions:      physical, psychological, and tactical. From a theoretical thematic analysis, it      was found that the perception of effort is closely related to how effort is      distributed within the team. Moreover, coaches viewed physical effort in relation      to the frequency and intensity of the players' involvement in the game. They      identified psychological effort in situations where players pay attention to      proper cues, and manage emotions under difficult circumstances. Tactical effort      addressed the decision-making process of players and how they fulfilled their      roles while taking into account the actions of their teammates and opponents.      Based on these findings, a model of perceived distributed effort was developed,      which delineates the elements that compose each of the aforementioned dimensions.      Implications of perceived distributed effort in team coordination and shared      mental models are discussed.FAU - Beniscelli, VioletaAU  - Beniscelli VAD  - a Psicologia Basica, Evolutiva i de l'Educacio , Universitat Autonoma de      Barcelona , Barcelona , Spain.FAU - Tenenbaum, GershonAU  - Tenenbaum GFAU - Schinke, Robert JoelAU  - Schinke RJFAU - Torregrosa, MiquelAU  - Torregrosa MLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20140110PL  - EnglandTA  - J Sports SciJT  - Journal of sports sciencesJID - 8405364SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Athletic Performance/*physiology/*psychologyMH  - AttentionMH  - Basketball/physiology/psychologyMH  - Cooperative BehaviorMH  - Decision MakingMH  - EmotionsMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - MotivationMH  - *PerceptionMH  - Soccer/physiology/psychologyMH  - Sports/*physiology/*psychologyMH  - Volleyball/physiology/psychologyEDAT- 2014/01/11 06:00MHDA- 2014/10/16 06:00CRDT- 2014/01/11 06:00PHST- 2014/01/10 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1080/02640414.2013.853131 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Sci. 2014;32(8):710-21. doi: 10.1080/02640414.2013.853131.

OBJECTIVE: To       review and update the literature in regard to the history, pathophysiology,      recognition, assessment, management and knowledge of concussion. METHODS:      Searches of electronic literature databases were performed to identify studies      published up until April 2013. RESULTS: 292 publications focussing on concussion       met the inclusion criteria, and so they were quality rated and reviewed.      CONCLUSION: Concussion is hard to recognize and diagnose. Initial sideline      assessment via the Sports Concussion Assessment Tool 3 (SCAT3), Child-SCAT3 or      King-Devick test should be undertaken to identify athletes with concussion as      part of a continuum of assessment modalities and athlete management. Sports      medicine practitioners should be cognisant of the definition, extent and nature      of concussion, and should work with coaches, athletes and trainers to identify      and manage concussions. The most common reason for variations in management of      concussion is lack of awareness of-and confusion about-the many available      published guidelines for concussion. Future research should focus on better      systems and tools for recognition, assessment and management of concussion. Sport      participants' knowledge of concussion should be evaluated more rigorously, with      interventions for sports where there is little knowledge of recognition,      assessment and appropriate management of concussion.FAU - King, DougAU  - King DAD  - Sports Performance Research Institute New Zealand (SPRINZ) at AUT Millennium,      Faculty of Health and Environmental Science, Auckland University of Technology,      Auckland, New Zealand, dking@aut.ac.nz.FAU - Brughelli, MattAU  - Brughelli MFAU - Hume, PatriaAU  - Hume PFAU - Gissane, ConorAU  - Gissane CLA  - engPT  - Historical ArticlePT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - New ZealandTA  - Sports MedJT  - Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)JID - 8412297SB  - IMMH  - *Athletic Injuries/diagnosis/history/physiopathology/therapyMH  - *Brain Concussion/diagnosis/history/physiopathology/therapyMH  - Health Knowledge, Attitudes, PracticeMH  - Health PersonnelMH  - History, 17th CenturyMH  - History, 19th CenturyMH  - HumansMH  - Neuropsychological TestsMH  - Practice Guidelines as TopicMH  - RecurrenceMH  - Risk FactorsEDAT- 2014/01/10 06:00MHDA- 2014/12/15 06:00CRDT- 2014/01/10 06:00AID - 10.1007/s40279-013-0134-x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Sports Med. 2014 Apr;44(4):449-71. doi: 10.1007/s40279-013-0134-x.PMID- 24379720OWN - NLMSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINEDA  - 20131231DCOM- 20140624LR  - 20140624IS  - 1179-1543 (Electronic)IS  - 1179-1543 (Linking)VI  - 4DP  - 2013TI  - Youth sport: positive and negative impact on young athletes.PG  - 151-60LID - 10.2147/OAJSM.S33556 [doi]AB  - Organized youth sports are highly popular for youth and their families, with      approximately 45 million children and adolescent participants in the US. Seventy       five percent of American families with school-aged children have at least one      child participating in organized sports. On the surface, it appears that US      children are healthy and happy as they engage in this traditional pastime, and      families report higher levels of satisfaction if their children participate.      However, statistics demonstrate a childhood obesity epidemic, with one of three      children now being overweight, with an increasingly sedentary lifestyle for most       children and teenagers. Increasing sports-related injuries, with 2.6 million      emergency room visits a year for those aged 5-24 years, a 70%-80% attrition rate       by the time a child is 15 years of age, and programs overemphasizing winning are       problems encountered in youth sport. The challenges faced by adults who are      involved in youth sports, from parents, to coaches, to sports medicine providers,      are multiple, complex, and varied across ethnic cultures, gender, communities,      and socioeconomic levels. It appears that an emphasis on fun while establishing a      balance between physical fitness, psychologic well-being, and lifelong lessons      for a healthy and active lifestyle are paramount for success.FAU - Merkel, Donna LAU  - Merkel DLAD  - Bryn Mawr Rehabilitation Hospital, Main Line Health System, Exton, PA, USA.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20130531PL  - New ZealandTA  - Open Access J Sports MedJT  - Open access journal of sports medicineJID - 101566036PMC - PMC3871410OID - NLM: PMC3871410OTO - NOTNLMOT  - benefitsOT  - injuriesOT  - preventionOT  - risksOT  - specializationOT  - youth sportsEDAT- 2014/01/01 06:00MHDA- 2014/01/01 06:01CRDT- 2014/01/01 06:00PHST- 2013 [ecollection]PHST- 2013/05/31 [epublish]AID - 10.2147/OAJSM.S33556 [doi]AID - oajsm-4-151 [pii]PST - epublishSO  - Open Access J Sports Med. 2013 May 31;4:151-60. doi: 10.2147/OAJSM.S33556.PMID- 24352092OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20131219DCOM- 20140723LR  - 20141112IS  - 2072-6643 (Electronic)IS  - 2072-6643 (Linking)VI  - 5IP  - 12DP  - 2013 DecTI  - Eating disorders, physical fitness and sport performance: a systematic review.PG  - 5140-60LID - 10.3390/nu5125140 [doi]AB  - BACKGROUND: Eating disorders are health problems that are particularly prevalent       in adolescents and young adults. They are associated with considerable physical      health and psychosocial morbidity, and increased risk of mortality. We set out to      conduct a systematic review to determine their effect on physical fitness in the       general population and on sport performance in athletes. METHODS/DESIGN: A      systematic review of the relevant peer-reviewed literature was performed. For      inclusion, articles retrieved from PubMed had to be published in English between       1977 and 2013. Wherever possible, methods and reporting adhere to the guidelines       outlined in the PRISMA statement. Some additional studies were retrieved from      among those cited in the reference lists of included studies and from      non-electronic databases. Literature searches, study selection, method and      quality appraisal were performed independently by two authors, and data was      synthesized using a narrative approach. RESULTS: Of the 1183 articles retrieved,       twenty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria and were consequently analysed.      The available data indicate that eating disorders have a negative effect on      physical fitness and sport performance by causing low energy availability,      excessive loss of fat and lean mass, dehydration, and electrolyte disturbance.      DISCUSSION: Although the paucity of the available data mean that findings to date      should be interpreted with caution, the information collated in this review has      several practical implications. First, eating disorders have a negative effect on      both physical fitness and sport performance. Second athletics coaches should be      targeted for education about the risk factors of eating disorders, as      deterioration in sport performance in athletes, particularly if they are      underweight or show other signs of an eating disorder, may indicate the need for       medical intervention. However, future studies are needed, especially to assess      the direct effect of eating disorders on sport performance.FAU - El Ghoch, MarwanAU  - El Ghoch MAD  - Department of Eating and Weight Disorders, Villa Garda Hospital, Via Montebaldo,       Garda (VR) 89I-37016, Italy. marwan1979@hotmail.com.FAU - Soave, FabioAU  - Soave FFAU - Calugi, SimonaAU  - Calugi SFAU - Dalle Grave, RiccardoAU  - Dalle Grave RLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20131216PL  - SwitzerlandTA  - NutrientsJT  - NutrientsJID - 101521595SB  - IMMH  - Athletic Performance/*physiologyMH  - Databases, FactualMH  - Eating Disorders/*therapyMH  - HumansMH  - Physical Fitness/*physiologyMH  - Risk FactorsPMC - PMC3875919OID - NLM: PMC3875919EDAT- 2013/12/20 06:00MHDA- 2014/07/24 06:00CRDT- 2013/12/20 06:00PHST- 2013/09/23 [received]PHST- 2013/10/24 [revised]PHST- 2013/12/05 [accepted]AID - nu5125140 [pii]AID - 10.3390/nu5125140 [doi]PST - epublishSO  - Nutrients. 2013 Dec 16;5(12):5140-60. doi: 10.3390/nu5125140.PMID- 24340774OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20131213DCOM- 20140117IS  - 1026-9428 (Print)IS  - 1026-9428 (Linking)IP  - 9DP  - 2013TI  - [Increased functional resources in athletes of cyclic sports].PG  - 42-4AB  - The article covers individual coaching program specified by specialists in Sports      Medicine and Rehabilitation Center in Bournazian FMBC of the FMBA of Russia, to      improve functional durability of highly qualified athletes.FAU - Kotenko, K VAU  - Kotenko KVFAU - Uiba, V VAU  - Uiba VVFAU - Korchazhkina, N BAU  - Korchazhkina NBFAU - Petrova, M SAU  - Petrova MSFAU - Kish, A AAU  - Kish AAFAU - Mikhailova, A AAU  - Mikhailova AALA  - rusPT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - Russia (Federation)TA  - Med Tr Prom EkolJT  - Meditsina truda i promyshlennaia ekologiiaJID - 9434213SB  - IMMH  - AthletesMH  - *Athletic Performance/physiology/standardsMH  - Exercise Test/methods/standardsMH  - HumansMH  - Physical FitnessMH  - Physical Therapy Modalities/*standardsMH  - Rehabilitation Centers/organization & administrationMH  - RussiaMH  - Sports Medicine/methodsEDAT- 2013/12/18 06:00MHDA- 2014/01/18 06:00CRDT- 2013/12/18 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Med Tr Prom Ekol. 2013;(9):42-4.PMID- 24340769OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20131213DCOM- 20140117IS  - 1026-9428 (Print)IS  - 1026-9428 (Linking)IP  - 9DP  - 2013TI  - [Cytoprotectors and their application in sports medicine].PG  - 22-6AB  - The article presents data of literature review on potential use of cytoprotectors      in sports medicine (exemplified by Mildronat medication).

AIM: To better understand the athlete and      non-athlete requirements of the physiotherapy services at the Olympic Village      Polyclinic during the London 2012 Olympic Games. METHODS: From 16 July to 14      August 2012, physiotherapy encounters for athletes and non-athletes (National      Olympic Committee (NOC) team officials, coaches, team managers, workforce,      Olympic family, technical officials and press) were recorded on the ATOS      electronic medical records system at the polyclinic in the main Athletes' Village      in Stratford. RESULTS: Of the 1778 encounters, 1219 (69%) were administered to      athletes and 559 (31%) to non-athletes. The anatomical areas most frequently      recorded at the first visits for athletes were knee (15.4%), lumbar spine/lower      back (15.2%) and upper leg (12.6%) and that for non-athletes were lumbar      spine/lower back (19.8%), knee (15.8%) and neck/cervical spine. Muscle (33.3%)      and joint injuries (24.8%) were the most common diagnoses in athletes and      non-athletes (24.4% and 30.1%). The five most frequently used treatment      modalities were therapeutic soft tissue techniques (23.3%), mobilisation      techniques (21.8%), taping (8.9%), cryotherapy (6.9%) and exercise prescription      (6.4%). The most common cause of athletes' injuries was overuse (43.6%).      CONCLUSIONS: This study of the London 2012 Olympic Games workload highlights the       physiotherapy needs of athletes as well as non-athletes and identifies the high      numbers of pre-existing and overuse injuries in this setting, providing an      insight into the reasons why the athletes seek physiotherapy support during the      Olympic Games.FAU - Grant, Marie-ElaineAU  - Grant MEAD  - International Olympic Committee, , Lausanne, Switzerland.FAU - Steffen, KathrinAU  - Steffen KFAU - Glasgow, PhilipAU  - Glasgow PFAU - Phillips, NicolaAU  - Phillips NFAU - Booth, LynnAU  - Booth LFAU - Galligan, MarieAU  - Galligan MLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - EnglandTA  - Br J Sports MedJT  - British journal of sports medicineJID - 0432520SB  - IMMH  - Athletic Injuries/classification/*therapyMH  - HumansMH  - LondonMH  - MaleMH  - Physical Therapists/*utilizationMH  - Physical Therapy Modalities/*utilizationMH  - Sports Medicine/*methodsMH  - WorkloadOTO - NOTNLMOT  - AthleticsOT  - OlympicsOT  - PhysiotherapyEDAT- 2013/12/18 06:00MHDA- 2014/10/03 06:00CRDT- 2013/12/17 06:00AID - 48/1/63 [pii]AID - 10.1136/bjsports-2013-093169 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Br J Sports Med. 2014 Jan;48(1):63-70. doi: 10.1136/bjsports-2013-093169.PMID- 24323340OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20131210DCOM- 20140730IS  - 1868-601X (Electronic)IS  - 1868-4483 (Linking)VI  - 4IP  - 4DP  - 2013 AugTI  - Sport-related concussion: "how many is too many?".PG  - 425-31LID - 10.1007/s12975-012-0237-y [doi]AB  - The long-term effects of multiple sport-related concussions are currently at the       center of debate in the popular press and scientific community. The question,      "How many concussions are too many," is frequently asked in the competitive sport      environment by parents, athletes, and coaches. While research suggests that a      history of concussion influences the risk and recovery from subsequent      concussion, studies investigating the long-term effects of multiple concussions      are less conclusive. This paper reviews the literature on multiple concussions      and the potential long-term consequences of these injuries. Furthermore, this      paper addresses how concussion history can inform clinical and return-to-play      decisions. Recent studies incorporating novel brain imaging and      electrophysiological technology for assessing residual impairment from multiple      concussions are reviewed and the clinical implications of this work are      discussed.FAU - Elbin, R JAU  - Elbin RJAD  - Department of Orthopaedic Surgery/UPMC Sports Medicine Concussion Program,      University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, 15260, USA, rje13@pitt.edu.FAU - Covassin, TraceyAU  - Covassin TFAU - Henry, LukeAU  - Henry LFAU - Whalen, Diana JAU  - Whalen DJFAU - Wedge, JennineAU  - Wedge JFAU - Kontos, Anthony PAU  - Kontos APLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20121221PL  - United StatesTA  - Transl Stroke ResJT  - Translational stroke researchJID - 101517297SB  - IMMH  - Athletic Injuries/*etiology/physiopathology/therapyMH  - Brain Concussion/*etiology/physiopathology/therapyMH  - Cognition Disorders/etiologyMH  - Decision MakingMH  - HumansMH  - Neuropsychological TestsMH  - PrognosisMH  - Recovery of FunctionMH  - RecurrenceMH  - Risk FactorsEDAT- 2013/12/11 06:00MHDA- 2014/07/31 06:00CRDT- 2013/12/11 06:00PHST- 2012/11/07 [received]PHST- 2012/12/02 [accepted]PHST- 2012/11/27 [revised]PHST- 2012/12/21 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1007/s12975-012-0237-y [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Transl Stroke Res. 2013 Aug;4(4):425-31. doi: 10.1007/s12975-012-0237-y.

Furthermore, there is insufficient evidence about the levels or types of       PA associated specifically with psychological health. This paper first presents      the results of a systematic review of the psychological and social health      benefits of participation in sport by adults. Secondly, the information arising      from the systematic review has been used to develop a conceptual model of Health       through Sport. METHODS: A systematic review of 14 electronic databases was      conducted in June 2012, and studies published since 1990 were considered for      inclusion. Studies that addressed mental and/or social health benefits from      participation in sport were included. RESULTS: A total of 3668 publications were       initially identified, of which 11 met the selection criteria. There were many      different psychological and social health benefits reported, with the most      commonly being wellbeing and reduced distress and stress. Sport may be associated      with improved psychosocial health in addition to improvements attributable to      participation in PA. Specifically, club-based or team-based sport seems to be      associated with improved health outcomes compared to individual activities, due      to the social nature of the participation. Notwithstanding this, individuals who       prefer to participate in sport by themselves can still derive mental health      benefits which can enhance the development of true-self-awareness and personal      growth which is essential for social health. A conceptual model, Health through      Sport, is proposed. The model depicts the relationship between psychological,      psychosocial and social health domains, and their positive associations with      sport participation, as reported in the literature. However, it is acknowledged      that the capacity to determine the existence and direction of causal links      between participation and health is limited by the cross-sectional nature of      studies to date. CONCLUSION: It is recommended that participation in sport is      advocated as a form of leisure-time PA for adults which can produce a range of      health benefits. It is also recommended that the causal link between      participation in sport and psycho-social health be further investigated and the      conceptual model of Health through Sport tested.FAU - Eime, Rochelle MAU  - Eime RMAD  - Institute of Sport, Exercise and Active Living, Victoria University, PO Box      14428, Melbourne, Victoria 8001, Australia.

The other health of human play.PG  - 127-50AB  - Hurling in Cornwall, la soule in Britanny, Shrovetide football in England:      Popular games have normally been treated as forerunners of modern sport, sport      having regulated the space and the time of the game, the (non-) violence of      behaviour, the control of results, the planning, strategy, tactics, techniques      and evaluation of the competitive action. This is told as a story of social      improvement and progress--and about turning unhealthy wildness into civilized      'healthy' sport activity. What sociological analysis of game-playing tended to      ignore was the laughter of the participants. With the seriousness of modern      sport, as it was established in the nineteenth century, a culture of laughter      disappeared. This study tries to counter this mainstream by a phenomenology of      laughter in popular games. A contrasting attention is turned towards the      seriousness of sporting competition, the smile in modern sport and fitness, and      the 'underground' dimension of laughter in modern sports. By comparative      analysis, laughter reveals as a bodily discourse about the imperfect human being.      It tells an oppositional story about the perfectionism in the order of Western      thinking--in sports as well as in health. The bodily 'physiology' of laughter,      the exploding psychical energy, and the inter-bodily social relations in laughter      and play and game point towards the multi-dimensionality of health, as it was      formulated by WHO: as "physical, mental, and social well-being".FAU - Eichberg, HenningAU  - Eichberg HAD  - Institute of Sports Science and Clinical Biomechanics, Faculty of Health      Sciences, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, DK. heichberg@health.sdu.dkLA  - engPT  - Historical ArticlePT  - Journal ArticlePL  - SwitzerlandTA  - GesnerusJT  - GesnerusJID - 1257130SB  - IMSB  - QISMH  - FemaleMH  - History, 15th CenturyMH  - History, 16th CenturyMH  - History, 17th CenturyMH  - History, 18th CenturyMH  - History, 19th CenturyMH  - History, 20th CenturyMH  - History, MedievalMH  - HumansMH  - *LaughterMH  - MaleMH  - *Social DistanceMH  - Sports/*historyEDAT- 2013/12/07 06:00MHDA- 2013/12/19 06:00CRDT- 2013/12/07 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Gesnerus. 2013;70(1):127-50.PMID- 24282213OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20131127DCOM- 20140709LR  - 20141112IS  - 1473-0480 (Electronic)IS  - 0306-3674 (Linking)VI  - 47 Suppl 1DP  - 2013 DecTI  - Position statement--altitude training for improving team-sport players'      performance: current knowledge and unresolved issues.PG  - i8-16LID - 10.1136/bjsports-2013-093109 [doi]AB  - Despite the limited research on the effects of altitude (or hypoxic) training      interventions on team-sport performance, players from all around the world      engaged in these sports are now using altitude training more than ever before. In      March 2013, an Altitude Training and Team Sports conference was held in Doha,      Qatar, to establish a forum of research and practical insights into this rapidly       growing field. A round-table meeting in which the panellists engaged in focused      discussions concluded this conference. This has resulted in the present position       statement, designed to highlight some key issues raised during the debates and to      integrate the ideas into a shared conceptual framework. The present signposting      document has been developed for use by support teams (coaches, performance      scientists, physicians, strength and conditioning staff) and other professionals       who have an interest in the practical application of altitude training for team      sports. After more than four decades of research, there is still no consensus on       the optimal strategies to elicit the best results from altitude training in a      team-sport population. However, there are some recommended strategies discussed      in this position statement to adopt for improving the acclimatisation process      when training/competing at altitude and for potentially enhancing sea-level      performance. It is our hope that this information will be intriguing, balanced      and, more importantly, stimulating to the point that it promotes constructive      discussion and serves as a guide for future research aimed at advancing the      bourgeoning body of knowledge in the area of altitude training for team sports.FAU - Girard, OlivierAU  - Girard OAD  - Research and Education Centre, ASPETAR, Qatar Orthopaedic and Sports Medicine      Hospital, , Doha, Qatar.FAU - Amann, MarkusAU  - Amann MFAU - Aughey, RobertAU  - Aughey RFAU - Billaut, FrancoisAU  - Billaut FFAU - Bishop, David JAU  - Bishop DJFAU - Bourdon, PitreAU  - Bourdon PFAU - Buchheit, MartinAU  - Buchheit MFAU - Chapman, RobertAU  - Chapman RFAU - D'Hooghe, MichelAU  - D'Hooghe MFAU - Garvican-Lewis, Laura AAU  - Garvican-Lewis LAFAU - Gore, Christopher JAU  - Gore CJFAU - Millet, Gregoire PAU  - Millet GPFAU - Roach, Gregory DAU  - Roach GDFAU - Sargent, CharliAU  - Sargent CFAU - Saunders, Philo UAU  - Saunders PUFAU - Schmidt, WalterAU  - Schmidt WFAU - Schumacher, Yorck OAU  - Schumacher YOLA  - engPT  - Consensus Development ConferencePT  - Journal ArticlePL  - EnglandTA  - Br J Sports MedJT  - British journal of sports medicineJID - 0432520SB  - IMMH  - Acclimatization/*physiologyMH  - *AltitudeMH  - Anoxia/physiopathologyMH  - Athletic Performance/*physiologyMH  - Atmospheric PressureMH  - Competitive Behavior/physiologyMH  - Exercise/physiologyMH  - Exercise Tolerance/physiologyMH  - ForecastingMH  - Group ProcessesMH  - HumansMH  - Professional Practice/trendsMH  - Sleep/physiologyMH  - Sports Medicine/methods/trendsPMC - PMC3903313OID - NLM: PMC3903313OTO - NOTNLMOT  - AltitudeOT  - Assessing physical training modalities in enhancing sports performanceOT  - Elite performanceOT  - SoccerOT  - TrainingEDAT- 2013/12/07 06:00MHDA- 2014/07/10 06:00CRDT- 2013/11/28 06:00AID - 47/Suppl_1/i8 [pii]AID - 10.1136/bjsports-2013-093109 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Br J Sports Med. 2013 Dec;47 Suppl 1:i8-16. doi: 10.1136/bjsports-2013-093109.PMID- 24282202OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20131127DCOM- 20140709LR  - 20141112IS  - 1473-0480 (Electronic)IS  - 0306-3674 (Linking)VI  - 47 Suppl 1DP  - 2013 DecTI  - Update in the understanding of altitude-induced limitations to performance in      team-sport athletes.PG  - i22-5LID - 10.1136/bjsports-2013-092834 [doi]AB  - The internationalism of field-based team sports (TS) such as football and rugby      requires teams to compete in tournaments held at low to moderate altitude (      approximately 1200-2500 m). In TS, acceleration, speed and aerobic endurance are       physical characteristics associated with ball possession and, ultimately,      scoring. While these qualities are affected by the development of neuromuscular      fatigue at sea level, arterial hypoxaemia induced by exposure to altitude may      further hinder the capacity to perform consecutive accelerations (CAC) or sprint       endurance and thereby change the outcome of a match. The higher the altitude, the      more severe the hypoxaemia, and thus, the larger the expected decline in aerobic       endurance, CAC and match running performance. Therefore, it is critical for      athletes and coaches to understand how arterial hypoxaemia affects aerobic      endurance and CAC and the magnitude of decline they may face at altitude for      optimal preparation and increased chances of success. This mini review summarises      the effects of acute altitude/hypoxia exposure on aerobic endurance, CAC and      activity profiles of TS athletes performing in the laboratory and during matches       at natural altitude, and analyses the latest findings about the consequences of      arterial hypoxaemia on the relationship between peripheral perturbations, neural       adjustments and performance during repeated sprints or CAC. Finally, we briefly      discuss how altitude training can potentially help athletes prepare for      competition at altitude.FAU - Billaut, FrancoisAU  - Billaut FAD  - Institut national du sport du Quebec, , Montreal, Quebec, Canada.FAU - Aughey, Robert JAU  - Aughey RJLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - EnglandTA  - Br J Sports MedJT  - British journal of sports medicineJID - 0432520SB  - IMMH  - AccelerationMH  - Acclimatization/*physiologyMH  - *AltitudeMH  - Anoxia/physiopathologyMH  - Athletic Performance/*physiologyMH  - Energy Metabolism/physiologyMH  - Exercise/physiologyMH  - Exercise Tolerance/physiologyMH  - HumansMH  - Muscle Fatigue/physiologyMH  - Oxygen Consumption/physiologyMH  - Running/physiologyPMC - PMC3903141OID - NLM: PMC3903141OTO - NOTNLMOT  - AltitudeOT  - Exercise physiologyOT  - FatigueOT  - SoccerEDAT- 2013/12/07 06:00MHDA- 2014/07/10 06:00CRDT- 2013/11/28 06:00AID - 47/Suppl_1/i22 [pii]AID - 10.1136/bjsports-2013-092834 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Br J Sports Med. 2013 Dec;47 Suppl 1:i22-5. doi: 10.1136/bjsports-2013-092834.PMID- 24293244OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20140327DCOM- 20141124IS  - 1179-2035 (Electronic)IS  - 0112-1642 (Linking)VI  - 44IP  - 4DP  - 2014 AprTI  - Tests examining skill outcomes in sport: a systematic review of measurement      properties and feasibility.PG  - 501-18LID - 10.1007/s40279-013-0131-0 [doi]AB  - BACKGROUND: A high level of participant skill is influential in determining the      outcome of many sports. Thus, tests assessing skill outcomes in sport are      commonly used by coaches and researchers to estimate an athlete's ability level,       to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions or for the purpose of talent      identification. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic review was to examine      the methodological quality, measurement properties and feasibility      characteristics of sporting skill outcome tests reported in the peer-reviewed      literature. DATA SOURCES: A search of both SPORTDiscus and MEDLINE databases was       undertaken. STUDY SELECTION: Studies that examined tests of sporting skill      outcomes were reviewed. Only studies that investigated measurement properties of       the test (reliability or validity) were included. A total of 22 studies met the      inclusion/exclusion criteria. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: A customised      checklist of assessment criteria, based on previous research, was utilised for      the purpose of this review. RESULTS: A range of sports were the subject of the 22      studies included in this review, with considerations relating to methodological      quality being generally well addressed by authors. A range of methods and      statistical procedures were used by researchers to determine the measurement      properties of their skill outcome tests. The majority (95%) of the reviewed      studies investigated test-retest reliability, and where relevant, inter and      intra-rater reliability was also determined. Content validity was examined in 68%      of the studies, with most tests investigating multiple skill domains relevant to       the sport. Only 18% of studies assessed all three reviewed forms of validity      (content, construct and criterion), with just 14% investigating the predictive      validity of the test. Test responsiveness was reported in only 9% of studies,      whilst feasibility received varying levels of attention. LIMITATIONS: In      organised sport, further tests may exist which have not been investigated in this      review. This could be due to such tests firstly not being published in the      peer-review literature and secondly, not having their measurement properties      (i.e., reliability or validity) examined formally. CONCLUSIONS: Of the 22 studies      included in this review, items relating to test methodological quality were, on      the whole, well addressed. Test-retest reliability was determined in all but one       of the reviewed studies, whilst most studies investigated at least two aspects of      validity (i.e., content, construct or criterion-related validity). Few studies      examined predictive validity or responsiveness. While feasibility was addressed      in over half of the studies, practicality and test limitations were rarely      addressed. Consideration of study quality, measurement properties and feasibility      components assessed in this review can assist future researchers when developing       or modifying tests of sporting skill outcomes.FAU - Robertson, Samuel JAU  - Robertson SJAD  - Centre for Exercise and Sports Sciences, School of Exercise and Nutrition      Sciences, Deakin University, Burwood Campus, 221 Burwood Hwy, Burwood, Melbourne,      VIC, 3125, Australia, sam.robertson@deakin.edu.au.FAU - Burnett, Angus FAU  - Burnett AFFAU - Cochrane, JodieAU  - Cochrane JLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - New ZealandTA  - Sports MedJT  - Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)JID - 8412297SB  - IMMH  - Athletic Performance/*physiologyMH  - ChecklistMH  - HumansMH  - Motor Skills/*physiologyMH  - Reproducibility of ResultsMH  - Sports/*physiologyMH  - Task Performance and AnalysisEDAT- 2013/12/03 06:00MHDA- 2014/12/15 06:00CRDT- 2013/12/03 06:00AID - 10.1007/s40279-013-0131-0 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Sports Med. 2014 Apr;44(4):501-18. doi: 10.1007/s40279-013-0131-0.PMID- 24289060OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20140203DCOM- 20140321LR  - 20141112IS  - 1471-2458 (Electronic)IS  - 1471-2458 (Linking)VI  - 13DP  - 2013TI  - Fit in 50 years: participation in high school sports best predicts one's physical      activity after age 70.PG  - 1100LID - 10.1186/1471-2458-13-1100 [doi]AB  - BACKGROUND: The health benefits of physical activity are widely established,      including decreased risk for disease and improved mental well-being. Yet many      children, adolescents, and adults do not meet the minimum recommendations      specified in current public health guidelines and physical activity is known to      decrease during the life course. The aim of this study was to identify background      or personality characteristics that predict whether a healthy 25 year-old would      become a physically active 75 year-old. This could have powerful implications for      targeting physical activity and health interventions. METHOD: A unique data set      was collected of 712 healthy United States males who passed a rigorous physical      exam in the 1940s and who were surveyed 50 years later (in 2000). Their physical       activity level after 50 years was correlated and regressed across a wide number      of demographic, behavioral, and personality variables from when they were 50      years younger. Data was analyzed in 2012. RESULTS: In contrast to prior beliefs,       self-rated personality profile as a young man had little predictive influence on       later-life physical activity. Instead, the single strongest predictor of      later-life physical activity was whether he played a varsity sport in high      school, and this was also related to fewer self-reported visits to the doctor.      CONCLUSION: Encouraging systematic or frequent physical activity at a young age -      whether through school sports or club opportunities - might be the best      investment in long-term activeness.

Physical activity      (PA) intensity and contextual factors were recorded by momentary time-sampling      procedures (10-second observe, 20-second record). Two observers simultaneously      observed and recorded children's PA intensity, practice context, social context,       coach behavior, and coach proximity. Interrater reliability was based on      agreement (Kappa) between the observer's coding for each category, and the      Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for percent of time spent in MVPA.      Validity was assessed by calculating the correlation between OSRAC:YS estimated      and objectively measured MVPA. Kappa statistics for each category demonstrated      substantial to almost perfect interobserver agreement (Kappa = 0.67-0.93). The      ICC for percent time in MVPA was 0.76 (95% C.I. = 0.49-0.90). A significant      correlation (r = .73) was observed for MVPA recorded by observation and MVPA      measured via accelerometry. The results indicate the OSRAC:YS is a reliable and      valid tool for measuring children's PA and contextual factors during a youth      soccer practice.FAU - Cohen, AlysiaAU  - Cohen AAD  - School of Biological and Population Health Sciences, Oregon State University,      Corvallis, OR.FAU - McDonald, SamanthaAU  - McDonald SFAU - McIver, KerryAU  - McIver KFAU - Pate, RussellAU  - Pate RFAU - Trost, StewartAU  - Trost SLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Randomized Controlled TrialDEP - 20131125PL  - United StatesTA  - Pediatr Exerc SciJT  - Pediatric exercise scienceJID - 8909729SB  - IMMH  - AccelerometryMH  - ChildMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Motor Activity/*physiologyMH  - Observation/*methodsMH  - Reproducibility of ResultsMH  - Soccer/*physiologyEDAT- 2013/11/28 06:00MHDA- 2015/01/17 06:00CRDT- 2013/11/27 06:00PHST- 2013/11/25 [aheadofprint]AID - 2013-0095 [pii]AID - 10.1123/pes.2013-0095 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Pediatr Exerc Sci. 2014 May;26(2):203-9. doi: 10.1123/pes.2013-0095.

The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of      developmental considerations that should be noted when doing mental training,      particularly for athletes participating in sport at mid-childhood, early      adolescence, and mid-adolescence. Gender differences at these stages of      development are also highlighted. Additionally, we forward best practice      recommendations and learning-activities that have been tailored for each      developmental stage that can be used in the provision of a mental training      program in a team setting.FAU - Visek, Amanda JAU  - Visek AJAD  - The George Washington University, Washington, DC, USA.FAU - Harris, BrandonnAU  - Harris BFAU - Blom, Lindsey CAU  - Blom LCLA  - ENGGR  - K01 NR012770/NR/NINR NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLETA  - J Sport Psychol ActionJT  - Journal of sport psychology in actionJID - 101617007PMC - PMC3834981MID - NIHMS509648OTO - NOTNLMOT  - mental trainingOT  - playerOT  - servicesOT  - youth athleteEDAT- 2013/11/26 06:00MHDA- 2013/11/26 06:00CRDT- 2013/11/26 06:00AID - 10.1080/21520704.2012.733910 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sport Psychol Action. 2013 Jan 1;4(1). doi: 10.1080/21520704.2012.733910.PMID- 24261017OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20131122DCOM- 20140128IS  - 0270-1367 (Print)IS  - 0270-1367 (Linking)VI  - 84IP  - 3DP  - 2013 SepTI  - Coach-initiated motivational climate and cohesion in youth sport.PG  - 373-83AB  - PURPOSE: The general purpose of the present study was to examine the link between      cohesion and motivational climate in youth sport. The first specific objective      was to determine if relationships demonstrated in previous research with adult      basketball and handball participants would be replicated in a younger sample and       with a more heterogeneous set of sports. The second specific objective was to      examine whether sources of athlete enjoyment moderate the relationships between      motivational climate and cohesion. METHOD: Athletes (N = 997; 532 girls and 465      boys; Mage = 15.26 +/- 1.20 years) completed measures pertaining to      coach-initiated motivational climate, cohesion, and sources of enjoyment.      RESULTS: Bivariate and canonical correlations revealed positive correlations      between perceptions of a task-involving motivational climate and both task and      social cohesion, while ego-involving motivational climate was negatively related.      Cluster analyses suggested that individuals perceiving a low task-involving      climate and high ego-involving climate perceived their teams as less cohesive.      Finally, the degree to which participants derived enjoyment through      other-referenced competency served as a moderator in the motivational      climate-task cohesion relationship. Specifically, the relationship between task      cohesion and motivational climate was more pronounced for those individuals who      were less likely to derive enjoyment through other-referenced competency.      CONCLUSIONS: Youth athletes' perceptions of coach-initiated motivational climate       are related to cohesion. This relationship is, however, moderated by the degree      to which athletes derive enjoyment through other-referenced competency.      Motivational climate is an important variable to consider within team-building      protocols intent on developing cohesion.FAU - Eys, Mark AAU  - Eys MAAD  - Department of Kinesiology, Wilfrid Laurier University, Waterloo, ON, Canada.      meys@wlu.caFAU - Jewitt, ErynAU  - Jewitt EFAU - Evans, M BlairAU  - Evans MBFAU - Wolf, SvenjaAU  - Wolf SFAU - Bruner, Mark WAU  - Bruner MWFAU - Loughead, Todd MAU  - Loughead TMLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - United StatesTA  - Res Q Exerc SportJT  - Research quarterly for exercise and sportJID - 8006373SB  - IMMH  - AchievementMH  - AdolescentMH  - Cluster AnalysisMH  - *Cooperative BehaviorMH  - FemaleMH  - GoalsMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - *MentorsMH  - *MotivationMH  - Personal SatisfactionMH  - Sports/*physiology/*psychologyEDAT- 2013/11/23 06:00MHDA- 2014/01/29 06:00CRDT- 2013/11/23 06:00AID - 10.1080/02701367.2013.814909 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Res Q Exerc Sport. 2013 Sep;84(3):373-83.PMID- 24257080OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20140214DCOM- 20140417IS  - 1468-2044 (Electronic)IS  - 0003-9888 (Linking)VI  - 99IP  - 3DP  - 2014 MarTI  - Weekly sport practice and adolescent well-being.PG  - 208-10LID - 10.1136/archdischild-2013-303729 [doi]AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sport practice is widely encouraged, both in guidelines and in      clinical practice, because of its broad range of positive effects on health.      However, very limited evidence directly supports this statement among adolescents      and the sport duration that we should recommend remains unknown. We aimed to      determine sport durations that were associated with poor well-being. METHODS: We       conducted a survey including 1245 adolescents (16-20 years) from the general      Swiss population. Participants were recruited from various settings (sport      centres, peers of sport practicing adolescents, websites) and asked to complete a      web-based questionnaire. Weekly sport practice was categorised into four groups:       low (0-3.5 h), average ( approximately recommended 7 h (3.6-10.5)), high (      approximately 14 h (10.6-17.5)) and very high (>17.5 h). We assessed well-being      using the WHO-5 Well-Being Index. RESULTS: Compared with adolescents in the      average group, those in the very high group had a higher risk of poor well-being       (OR 2.29 (95% CI 1.11 to 4.72)), as did those in the low group (OR 2.33 (1.58 to       3.44)). In contrast, those in the high group had a lower risk of poor well-being       than those in the average group (OR 0.46 (0.23 to 0.93)). CONCLUSIONS: We found      an inverted, U-shaped relationship between weekly sport practice duration and      well-being among adolescents. The peak scores of well-being were around 14 h per       week of sport practice, corresponding to twice the recommended 7 h. Practicing      higher sport durations was an independent risk factor of poor well-being.FAU - Merglen, ArnaudAU  - Merglen AAD  - Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Lausanne, , Lausanne,       Switzerland.FAU - Flatz, AlineAU  - Flatz AFAU - Belanger, Richard EAU  - Belanger REFAU - Michaud, Pierre-AndreAU  - Michaud PAFAU - Suris, Joan-CarlesAU  - Suris JCLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20131120PL  - EnglandTA  - Arch Dis ChildJT  - Archives of disease in childhoodJID - 0372434SB  - AIMSB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Data CollectionMH  - Exercise/*physiologyMH  - FemaleMH  - *Health StatusMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Sports/*statistics & numerical dataMH  - Young AdultOTO - NOTNLMOT  - adolescentOT  - mental healthOT  - overtrainingOT  - sportOT  - well-beingEDAT- 2013/11/22 06:00MHDA- 2014/04/18 06:00CRDT- 2013/11/22 06:00PHST- 2013/11/20 [aheadofprint]AID - archdischild-2013-303729 [pii]AID - 10.1136/archdischild-2013-303729 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Arch Dis Child. 2014 Mar;99(3):208-10. doi: 10.1136/archdischild-2013-303729.

The purpose of this study was to      examine the factors that influence the intended use of concussion guidelines      among community-level coaches and sports trainers from two popular football codes      in Australia: Australian football and rugby league. DESIGN: Cross-sectional      survey. METHODS: The survey, based on an extended theory of planned behaviour      model, was completed by 183 Australian football coaches, 121 Australian football       sports trainers, 171 rugby league coaches, and 142 rugby league sports trainers.       RESULTS: Personal norms and self-efficacy were significant predictors of      intention to use concussion guidelines, although the relationship between      self-efficacy and intention was stronger among Australian football coaches than      rugby league coaches. Analysis of the salient beliefs that underpin self-efficacy      found that coaches, irrespective of football code, felt less familiar      (chi(2)=25.70, p<0.001) and less experienced (chi(2)=31.56, p<0.001) than sports       trainers in using the concussion guidelines. At the same time, Australian      football personnel, irrespective of their team role, felt that they had      insufficient time (chi(2)=8.04, p<0.01) and resources (chi(2)=12.31, p<0.001) to       implement the concussion guidelines relative to rugby league personnel.      CONCLUSIONS: Programmes aimed at increasing the intended use of sport concussion       guidelines should focus on enhancing self-efficacy and leveraging personal norms.      Increasing coaches' familiarity and experience in using the concussion guidelines      would also be warranted, as would finding ways to overcome the perceived time and      resource constraints identified among Australian football personnel.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 Sports Medicine Australia.

In Study 1,      semi-professional association football players completed questionnaire measures      before and after a competitive match. In Study 2, student athletes completed      questionnaire measures for two performance scenarios: one in which they were      performing above their normal level and one in which they were performing below      their normal level. Findings demonstrated that cognitive trait anxiety was      associated with greater disruptions in concentration but was unrelated to mental       effort. For state measures, athletes reported greater levels of concentration      disruption when experiencing high levels of anxiety or high levels of happiness,       and fewer disruptions in concentration when experiencing high levels of      excitement. Findings also showed that excitement was associated with low levels      of mental effort during good performances and high levels of mental effort during      poor performances; anxiety and happiness were associated with high levels of      mental effort during good performances and low levels of mental effort during      poor performances. Taken together, these studies point towards potential benefits      accompanying high levels of excitement and potential disadvantages accompanying      high levels of anxiety and happiness.FAU - Allen, Mark SAU  - Allen MSAD  - a Department of Applied Science , London South Bank University , London , UK.FAU - Jones, MarcAU  - Jones MFAU - McCarthy, Paul JAU  - McCarthy PJFAU - Sheehan-Mansfield, SamAU  - Sheehan-Mansfield SFAU - Sheffield, DavidAU  - Sheffield DLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20130220PL  - EnglandTA  - Eur J Sport SciJT  - European journal of sport scienceJID - 101146739SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Athletes/*psychologyMH  - Athletic Performance/*psychologyMH  - Attention/*physiologyMH  - Emotions/*physiologyMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - Mental Processes/*physiologyMH  - PerceptionMH  - Soccer/*psychologyEDAT- 2013/11/21 06:00MHDA- 2014/08/20 06:00CRDT- 2013/11/21 06:00PHST- 2013/02/20 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1080/17461391.2013.771381 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur J Sport Sci. 2013;13(6):697-706. doi: 10.1080/17461391.2013.771381.

Its purpose is      twofold, to create a typology for examining good practice in sport pedagogy that       is reflective and inclusive and raises awareness of the diverse needs of all      participants in physical activity 'regardless' of gender and ability for all      children. We acknowledge that access to physical activity, education and sport      are complex and multifaceted, however, the main purpose of this paper is to raise      awareness of 'diversity' by focusing specifically upon the role of gender and      ability. Through an examination of gender and disability policies in official      European Union (EU) policy documents and commercial examples of      policy-in-practice we propose a typology for diversity and diversity management.       A close look at EU level is instructive because national policies of the member      countries vary a lot with respect to diversity issues but should be in accordance      in the main areas. Such a reading enables the building of a typology of      recommendations for how such policy can be rendered in sport pedagogy practice.      We suggest six significant, but related principles that include (1)      mainstreaming; (2) teaching and coaching sensitive to difference; (3)      empowerment; (4) inclusion; (5) adaptation; and (6) inner differentiation. This      holistic typology seeks to 'mainstream' issues of gender and disability policy by      providing a set of principles that can be applied to a range of teaching and      coaching settings.FAU - Dinold, MariaAU  - Dinold MAD  - a Centre for Sport Science and University Sports, University of Vienna , Vienna ,      Austria.FAU - Diketmuller, RosaAU  - Diketmuller RFAU - Grix, JonathanAU  - Grix JFAU - Phillpots, LesleyAU  - Phillpots LLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20130304PL  - EnglandTA  - Eur J Sport SciJT  - European journal of sport scienceJID - 101146739SB  - IMMH  - European UnionMH  - FemaleMH  - Human Rights/legislation & jurisprudenceMH  - HumansMH  - Mainstreaming (Education)/legislation & jurisprudenceMH  - MaleMH  - Physical Education and Training/legislation & jurisprudence/*organization &      administrationMH  - Public PolicyMH  - Sex FactorsMH  - Sports/*educationMH  - Sports for Persons with Disabilities/*education/legislation & jurisprudenceMH  - Teaching/methodsMH  - Women's Rights/legislation & jurisprudenceEDAT- 2013/11/21 06:00MHDA- 2014/08/20 06:00CRDT- 2013/11/21 06:00PHST- 2013/03/04 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1080/17461391.2013.770925 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur J Sport Sci. 2013;13(6):689-96. doi: 10.1080/17461391.2013.770925.

For the field of relative age effects (RAEs) in sport, the scientific      method appears to be limited to description. The purpose of this paper is to      provide a theoretical model to explain RAEs in sport, which researchers can use      to test the effects, as well as to generate new hypotheses and recommendations.      Herein, we argue that social agents have the largest influence on RAEs.      Specifically, we propose that parents influence RAEs through Matthew effects,      coaches influence RAEs through Pygmalion effects and athletes influence RAEs      through Galatea effects. Integrating these three theories, we propose a model      that explains RAEs through these various social agents. This paper provides a      theoretical foundation from which researchers can further understand, explain and      eventually use to create policies aimed at limiting the negative effect of      relative age in sport.FAU - Hancock, David JAU  - Hancock DJAD  - a Queen's University , Kingston , Ontario , Canada.FAU - Adler, Ashley LAU  - Adler ALFAU - Cote, JeanAU  - Cote JLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20130305PL  - EnglandTA  - Eur J Sport SciJT  - European journal of sport scienceJID - 101146739SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - Age FactorsMH  - Aging/*physiology/psychologyMH  - Anticipation, PsychologicalMH  - Athletic Performance/*physiology/psychologyMH  - ChildMH  - Feedback, PsychologicalMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - Interpersonal RelationsMH  - MaleMH  - *Models, TheoreticalMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2013/11/21 06:00MHDA- 2014/08/20 06:00CRDT- 2013/11/21 06:00PHST- 2013/03/05 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1080/17461391.2013.775352 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur J Sport Sci. 2013;13(6):630-7. doi: 10.1080/17461391.2013.775352.

The sample      was divided into three groups (novice: n=35, intermediate: n=42; and elite      coaches: n=15) depending on the degree of specific education, coaching experience      and the level of the teams trained. To achieve this goal, the coaches answered a       questionnaire previously validated by specialists in sport sciences. The results       showed significant differences between the novice and elite group in small-sided       games, inferiority games, opposition and execution timing of the training and      drill items. The analyses also showed significant differences between the novice       and intermediate group in inferiority games and opposition of the training and      drill items. Although, no differences were identified between groups for the      remaining performance factors and training and drill items considered, the      identified trends provide a baseline related to the knowledge that contributes to      the development of expertise of futsal coaches.FAU - Serrano, JoaoAU  - Serrano JAD  - School of Sciences and Technology, University of Evora, Portugal.FAU - Shahidian, ShakibAU  - Shahidian SFAU - Sampaio, JaimeAU  - Sampaio JFAU - Leite, NunoAU  - Leite NLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20131008PL  - PolandTA  - J Hum KinetJT  - Journal of human kineticsJID - 101513031PMC - PMC3827762OID - NLM: PMC3827762OTO - NOTNLMOT  - coachingOT  - experienceOT  - futsalOT  - performanceOT  - trainingEDAT- 2013/11/16 06:00MHDA- 2013/11/16 06:01CRDT- 2013/11/16 06:00PHST- 2013/09/30 [ecollection]PHST- 2013/10/08 [epublish]AID - 10.2478/hukin-2013-0055 [doi]AID - jhk-38-151 [pii]PST - epublishSO  - J Hum Kinet. 2013 Oct 8;38:151-60. doi: 10.2478/hukin-2013-0055. eCollection      2013.PMID- 24231360OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20140830DCOM- 20141107IS  - 1555-0265 (Print)IS  - 1555-0265 (Linking)VI  - 9IP  - 5DP  - 2014 SepTI  - Comparison of athlete-coach perceptions of internal and external load markers for      elite junior tennis training.PG  - 751-6LID - 10.1123/ijspp2013-0364 [doi]AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the discrepancy between coach and athlete perceptions of       internal load and notational analysis of external load in elite junior tennis.      METHODS: Fourteen elite junior tennis players and 6 international coaches were      recruited. Ratings of perceived exertion (RPEs) were recorded for individual      drills and whole sessions, along with a rating of mental exertion, coach rating      of intended session exertion, and athlete heart rate (HR). Furthermore, total      stroke count and unforced-error count were notated using video coding after each       session, alongside coach and athlete estimations of shots and errors made.      Finally, regression analyses explained the variance in the criterion variables of      athlete and coach RPE. RESULTS: Repeated-measures analyses of variance and      interclass correlation coefficients revealed that coaches significantly (P < .01)      underestimated athlete session RPE, with only moderate correlation (r = .59)      demonstrated between coach and athlete. However, athlete drill RPE (P = .14; r =       .71) and mental exertion (P = .44; r = .68) were comparable and substantially      correlated. No significant differences in estimated stroke count were evident      between athlete and coach (P = .21), athlete notational analysis (P = .06), or      coach notational analysis (P = .49). Coaches estimated significantly greater      unforced errors than either athletes or notational analysis (P < .01). Regression      analyses found that 54.5% of variance in coach RPE was explained by intended      session exertion and coach drill RPE, while drill RPE and peak HR explained 45.3%      of the variance in athlete session RPE. CONCLUSION: Coaches misinterpreted      session RPE but not drill RPE, while inaccurately monitoring error counts.      Improved understanding of external- and internal-load monitoring may help      coach-athlete relationships in individual sports like tennis avoid maladaptive      training.FAU - Murphy, Alistair PAU  - Murphy APAD  - School of Human Movement Studies, Charles Sturt University, Bathurst, NSW,      Australia.FAU - Duffield, RobAU  - Duffield RFAU - Kellett, AaronAU  - Kellett AFAU - Reid, MacharAU  - Reid MLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20131114PL  - United StatesTA  - Int J Sports Physiol PerformJT  - International journal of sports physiology and performanceJID - 101276430SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Analysis of VarianceMH  - Athletes/*psychologyMH  - *Athletic Performance/physiology/psychologyMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart RateMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - *PerceptionMH  - Physical Conditioning, Human/physiology/psychologyMH  - Task Performance and AnalysisMH  - *Tennis/physiology/psychologyMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Video RecordingEDAT- 2013/11/16 06:00MHDA- 2014/11/08 06:00CRDT- 2013/11/16 06:00PHST- 2013/11/14 [aheadofprint]AID - 2013-0364 [pii]AID - 10.1123/ijspp2013-0364 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Int J Sports Physiol Perform. 2014 Sep;9(5):751-6. doi: 10.1123/ijspp2013-0364.

Despite growing awareness of sports-related concussions and      campaigns to educate athletes, coaches, physicians, and parents of young athletes      about concussion recognition and management, confusion and controversy persist in      many areas. Currently, diagnosis is based primarily on the symptoms reported by      the individual rather than on objective diagnostic markers, and there is little      empirical evidence for the optimal degree and duration of physical rest needed to      promote recovery or the best timing and approach for returning to full physical      activity. Sports-Related Concussions in Youth: Improving the Science, Changing      the Culture reviews the science of sports-related concussions in youth from      elementary school through young adulthood, as well as in military personnel and      their dependents. This report recommends actions that can be taken by a range of       audiences - including research funding agencies, legislatures, state and school      superintendents and athletic directors, military organizations, and equipment      manufacturers, as well as youth who participate in sports and their parents - to       improve what is known about concussions and to reduce their occurrence.      Sports-Related Concussions in Youth finds that while some studies provide useful       information, much remains unknown about the extent of concussions in youth; how      to diagnose, manage, and prevent concussions; and the short- and long-term      consequences of concussions as well as repetitive head impacts that do not result      in concussion symptoms. The culture of sports negatively influences athletes'      self-reporting of concussion symptoms and their adherence to return-to-play      guidance. Athletes, their teammates, and, in some cases, coaches and parents may       not fully appreciate the health threats posed by concussions. Similarly, military      recruits are immersed in a culture that includes devotion to duty and service      before self, and the critical nature of concussions may often go unheeded.      According to Sports-Related Concussions in Youth, if the youth sports community      can adopt the belief that concussions are serious injuries and emphasize care for      players with concussions until they are fully recovered, then the culture in      which these athletes perform and compete will become much safer. Improving      understanding of the extent, causes, effects, and prevention of sports-related      concussions is vitally important for the health and well-being of youth athletes.      The findings and recommendations in this report set a direction for research to      reach this goal.CI  - Copyright 2014 by the National Academy of Sciences.

However, there has been little      work done to establish how this knowledge may affect athletes' behaviors toward      reporting their concussions and removing themselves from play. We conducted an      anonymous online survey to assess athletes' knowledge of signs and symptoms of      concussion, and also sought to estimate the potential frequency of underreporting      in a collegiate athlete cohort. Among 262 athletes who responded to the survey,      43% of those with a history of concussion reported that they had knowingly hidden      symptoms of a concussion to stay in a game, and 22% of athletes overall indicated      that they would be unlikely or very unlikely to report concussion symptoms to a      coach or athletic trainer in the future. These data suggest that there may be a      substantial degree of underreporting of concussion among collegiate athletes,      despite most acknowledging that they have been formally educated about the risks       of concussion.FAU - Torres, Daniel MAU  - Torres DMAD  - Department of Neurology (DMT, SLG, LJB), New York University School of Medicine,       New York; and Departments of Neurology (KMG, HWP, EMSD, JAW, SLG, LJB),      Recreation and Intercollegiate Athletics, Athletic Training (EM, EAD),      Ophthalmology (SLG, LJB), and Epidemiology (LJB), University of Pennsylvania,      Philadelphia.FAU - Galetta, Kristin MAU  - Galetta KMFAU - Phillips, H WestleyAU  - Phillips HWFAU - Dziemianowicz, E Mark SAU  - Dziemianowicz EMFAU - Wilson, James AAU  - Wilson JAFAU - Dorman, Emily SAU  - Dorman ESFAU - Laudano, EricAU  - Laudano EFAU - Galetta, Steven LAU  - Galetta SLFAU - Balcer, Laura JAU  - Balcer LJLA  - ENGPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLETA  - Neurol Clin PractJT  - Neurology.

Health care professionals-including the team physician,      the physical therapist, and the athletic trainer-are faced with the challenge of       returning an athlete to competition as quickly as possible but as safely as      possible. Conflicts of interest arise due to conflicting obligations of the team       physician to the athlete and other members of the sports organization, including       coaches and the team owner. The multiple stakeholders involved in sports teams      challenge the traditional notion of confidentiality and autonomy.

The aim of this investigation was to construct and validate methods      for determining water polo-specific conditioning capacities. We constructed 4      combined-capacity tests that were designed to mimic real-game water polo      performances: sprint swimming performance, shooting performance, jumping      performance, and precision performance. In all cases, combined-capacity tests      included a period of standardized exhaustion followed by the performance of the      targeted quality (swimming, shooting, jumping, and precision). In the first part       of the study, single-capacity tests (sprint swim, in-water jump, drive shoot, and      precision performance) were tested and later included in the combined-capacity      tests. Study subjects consisted of 54 young male water polo players (15-18 years       of age, 185.6 +/- 6.7 cm, and 83.1 +/- 9.9 kg). Most of the tests evaluated were       found to be reliable with Cronbach alpha values ranging from 0.83 to 0.96 and      coefficients of variation from 21 to 2% (for the single-capacity tests) and 0.75       to 0.93 test-retest correlation (intraclass correlation coefficients) with      Bland-Altman tight limits of agreement (for combined-capacity tests). The      combined-capacity tests discriminated qualitative groups of junior water polo      players (national squad vs. team athletes) more effectively than single-capacity       tests. This is most likely because combined-capacity tests more closely represent      the complex fitness capacities required in real game situations. Strength and      conditioning practitioners and coaches working with water polo athletes should      consider incorporating these validated tests into their assessment protocols.FAU - Uljevic, OgnjenAU  - Uljevic OAD  - 1Faculty of Kinesiology, University of Split, Split, Croatia; and 2Human      Performance Laboratory, Auburn University at Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama.FAU - Esco, Michael RAU  - Esco MRFAU - Sekulic, DamirAU  - Sekulic DLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPT  - Validation StudiesPL  - United StatesTA  - J Strength Cond ResJT  - Journal of strength and conditioning research / National Strength & Conditioning       AssociationJID - 9415084SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AnthropometryMH  - Athletic Performance/*physiologyMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Muscle Strength/physiologyMH  - Physical Endurance/physiologyMH  - Physical Fitness/*physiologyMH  - Reproducibility of ResultsMH  - Swimming/*physiologyEDAT- 2013/10/31 06:00MHDA- 2015/01/15 06:00CRDT- 2013/10/31 06:00AID - 10.1519/JSC.0000000000000308 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Strength Cond Res. 2014 Jun;28(6):1595-605. doi: 10.1519/JSC.0000000000000308.PMID- 24165964OWN - NLMSTAT- PublisherDA  - 20131029IS  - 1573-3602 (Electronic)IS  - 1050-5350 (Linking)DP  - 2013 Oct 29TI  - Betting Patterns for Sports and Races: A Longitudinal Analysis of Online Wagering      in Australia.AB  - Online wagering is increasing in popularity as it is easily accessible through      websites which market these services widely. However, few studies have examined      online betting based on actual behavioural data. This paper describes the results      of an analysis of 2,522,299 bets placed with an Australian online wagering      operator over a 1-year period. The majority of bets placed were for a win (45.31       %) and were placed on races (86.74 %) or sports (11.29 %). Sports betting was      dominated by ball sports, reflecting popular interest in these events. More than       three-quarters (77.63 %) of the bets were losses and there was large variation in      bet size between bet types and events bet on although average bets were higher      than in previously reported studies. The most popular bets placed to win, had a      relatively high rate of losses and lowest average returns, which may reflect less      sophisticated betting behaviour. More specific handicap and total bets were      placed by fewer customers, but were larger bets with the greatest returns.      Similarly, bets placed on less popular sporting events had greater average      returns potentially reflecting greater customer sophistication and knowledge      raising the possibility of a proportion of bettors being more 'skilled'. As the      first paper to analyze the types of bets placed on events and outcomes the      results support the notion that wagering is an entertainment activity, and the      majority of customers are motivated by factors other than simply winning money.FAU - Gainsbury, Sally MAU  - Gainsbury SMAD  - Centre for Gambling Education and Research, Southern Cross University, P.O.

The aims      of this investigation were to determine knowledge on doping (KD) and knowledge on      sport nutrition (KSN), and corresponding socio-demographic-, sport-, and      sport-nutrition- and doping-factors among an international sample of high-level      tennis players of both sexes (43 females; 22 years old on average). In the first       phase of the investigation, the KSN and KD questionnaires were studied for their       reliability and validity. The consumption of NS is found to be very high, with      almost of all the females and 80% of the males using NS at least occasionally.      The athletes showed a low tendency regarding future doping usage, although most      of them are convinced that doping does exist in tennis. Since athletes declared      that their coaches are their main source of information about NS and doping,      future studies should investigate what coaches actually know about such problems.      KSN has been found to be protective against potential doping behavior in the      future. Males are found to be more prone to doping than females. Therefore, in      order to prevent doping behavior in tennis we strongly suggest intensive      educational programs on sports nutrition and doping-related problems. Key      PointsThe incidence of nutritional supplementation use among the tennis players      is found to be very high, especially among the females.Although most of the      subjects are of the opinion that the doping behavior is present in tennis      circuit, we have found a low tendency regarding future doping usage, and high      levels of athletes' trust in their coaches with regard to nutritional      supplementation and doping.There are indices that the knowledge about nutrition      is protective factor against potential doping behavior. It clearly reinforces the      need to include a wide educational program on sports nutrition in tennis, but      also in other sports.FAU - Kondric, MiranAU  - Kondric MAD  - Faculty of Sport, University of Ljubljana , Ljubljana, Slovenia;FAU - Sekulic, DamirAU  - Sekulic DFAU - Uljevic, OgnjenAU  - Uljevic OFAU - Gabrilo, GoranAU  - Gabrilo GFAU - Zvan, MilanAU  - Zvan MLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20130601PL  - TurkeyTA  - J Sports Sci MedJT  - Journal of sports science & medicineJID - 101174629PMC - PMC3761838OID - NLM: PMC3761838OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Dietary supplementationOT  - reliabilityOT  - substancesOT  - testOT  - validityEDAT- 2013/10/24 06:00MHDA- 2013/10/24 06:01CRDT- 2013/10/24 06:00PHST- 2013/06 [ecollection]PHST- 2012/08/27 [received]PHST- 2012/11/30 [accepted]PHST- 2013/06/01 [epublish]PST - epublishSO  - J Sports Sci Med. 2013 Jun 1;12(2):290-7. eCollection 2013.PMID- 24149730OWN - NLMSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINEDA  - 20131023DCOM- 20131023LR  - 20140124IS  - 1303-2968 (Electronic)IS  - 1303-2968 (Linking)VI  - 12IP  - 1DP  - 2013TI  - Reliability and Validity of a New Test of Change-of-Direction Speed for      Field-Based Sports: the Change-of-Direction and Acceleration Test (CODAT).PG  - 88-96AB  - Field sport coaches must use reliable and valid tests to assess      change-of-direction speed in their athletes. Few tests feature linear sprinting      with acute change- of-direction maneuvers. The Change-of-Direction and      Acceleration Test (CODAT) was designed to assess field sport change-of-direction       speed, and includes a linear 5-meter (m) sprint, 45 degrees and 90 degrees cuts,       3- m sprints to the left and right, and a linear 10-m sprint. This study analyzed      the reliability and validity of this test, through comparisons to 20-m sprint      (0-5, 0-10, 0-20 m intervals) and Illinois agility run (IAR) performance.      Eighteen Australian footballers (age = 23.83 +/- 7.04 yrs; height = 1.79 +/- 0.06      m; mass = 85.36 +/- 13.21 kg) were recruited. Following familiarization, subjects      completed the 20-m sprint, CODAT, and IAR in 2 sessions, 48 hours apart.      Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) assessed relative reliability.      Absolute reliability was analyzed through paired samples t-tests (p </= 0.05)      determining between-session differences. Typical error (TE), coefficient of      variation (CV), and differences between the TE and smallest worthwhile change      (SWC), also assessed absolute reliability and test usefulness. For the validity      analysis, Pearson's correlations (p </= 0.05) analyzed between-test      relationships. Results showed no between-session differences for any test (p =      0.19-0.86). CODAT time averaged ~6 s, and the ICC and CV equaled 0.84 and 3.0%,      respectively. The homogeneous sample of Australian footballers meant that the      CODAT's TE (0.19 s) exceeded the usual 0.2 x standard deviation (SD) SWC (0.10      s). However, the CODAT is capable of detecting moderate performance changes (SWC       calculated as 0.5 x SD = 0.25 s). There was a near perfect correlation between      the CODAT and IAR (r = 0.92), and very large correlations with the 20-m sprint (r      = 0.75-0.76), suggesting that the CODAT was a valid change-of-direction speed      test. Due to movement specificity, the CODAT has value for field sport      assessment. Key pointsThe change-of-direction and acceleration test (CODAT) was      designed specifically for field sport athletes from specific speed research, and       data derived from time-motion analyses of sports such as rugby union, soccer, and      Australian football. The CODAT features a linear 5-meter (m) sprint, 45 degrees      and 90 degrees cuts and 3-m sprints to the left and right, and a linear 10-m      sprint.The CODAT was found to be a reliable change-of-direction speed assessment       when considering intra-class correlations between two testing sessions, and the      coefficient of variation between trials. A homogeneous sample of Australian      footballers resulted in absolute reliability limitations when considering      differences between the typical error and smallest worthwhile change. However,      the CODAT will detect moderate (0.5 times the test's standard deviation) changes       in performance.The CODAT correlated with the Illinois agility run, highlighting      that it does assess change-of-direction speed. There were also significant      relationships with short sprint performance (i.e. 0-5 m and 0-10 m),      demonstrating that linear acceleration is assessed within the CODAT, without the       extended duration and therefore metabolic limitations of the IAR. Indeed, the      average duration of the test (~6 seconds) is field sport-specific. Therefore, the      CODAT could be used as an assessment of change-of-direction speed in field sport       athletes.FAU - Lockie, Robert GAU  - Lockie RGAD  - Exercise and Sport Science, School of Environmental and Life Sciences, University      of Newcastle , Australia.FAU - Schultz, Adrian BAU  - Schultz ABFAU - Callaghan, Samuel JAU  - Callaghan SJFAU - Jeffriess, Matthew DAU  - Jeffriess MDFAU - Berry, Simon PAU  - Berry SPLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20130301PL  - TurkeyTA  - J Sports Sci MedJT  - Journal of sports science & medicineJID - 101174629PMC - PMC3761765OID - NLM: PMC3761765OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Illinois agility runOT  - Lateral cuttingOT  - field testingOT  - linear speedOT  - team sportsEDAT- 2013/10/24 06:00MHDA- 2013/10/24 06:01CRDT- 2013/10/24 06:00PHST- 2013/03 [ecollection]PHST- 2012/06/25 [received]PHST- 2012/12/10 [accepted]PHST- 2013/03/01 [epublish]PST - epublishSO  - J Sports Sci Med. 2013 Mar 1;12(1):88-96. eCollection 2013.PMID- 24149722OWN - NLMSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINEDA  - 20131023DCOM- 20131023LR  - 20140124IS  - 1303-2968 (Electronic)IS  - 1303-2968 (Linking)VI  - 12IP  - 1DP  - 2013TI  - Artificial intelligence in sports on the example of weight training.PG  - 27-37AB  - The overall goal of the present study was to illustrate the potential of      artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in sports on the example of weight      training. The research focused in particular on the implementation of pattern      recognition methods for the evaluation of performed exercises on training      machines. The data acquisition was carried out using way and cable force sensors       attached to various weight machines, thereby enabling the measurement of      essential displacement and force determinants during training. On the basis of      the gathered data, it was consequently possible to deduce other significant      characteristics like time periods or movement velocities. These parameters were      applied for the development of intelligent methods adapted from conventional      machine learning concepts, allowing an automatic assessment of the exercise      technique and providing individuals with appropriate feedback. In practice, the      implementation of such techniques could be crucial for the investigation of the      quality of the execution, the assistance of athletes but also coaches, the      training optimization and for prevention purposes. For the current study, the      data was based on measurements from 15 rather inexperienced participants,      performing 3-5 sets of 10-12 repetitions on a leg press machine. The initially      preprocessed data was used for the extraction of significant features, on which      supervised modeling methods were applied. Professional trainers were involved in       the assessment and classification processes by analyzing the video recorded      executions. The so far obtained modeling results showed good performance and      prediction outcomes, indicating the feasibility and potency of AI techniques in      assessing performances on weight training equipment automatically and providing      sportsmen with prompt advice. Key pointsArtificial intelligence is a promising      field for sport-related analysis.Implementations integrating pattern recognition       techniques enable the automatic evaluation of data measurements.Artificial neural      networks applied for the analysis of weight training data show good performance      and high classification rates.FAU - Novatchkov, HristoAU  - Novatchkov HAD  - University of Vienna, Centre for Sport Science and University Sports , Auf der      Schmelz 6A, 1150 Vienna, Austria.FAU - Baca, ArnoldAU  - Baca ALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20130301PL  - TurkeyTA  - J Sports Sci MedJT  - Journal of sports science & medicineJID - 101174629PMC - PMC3761781OID - NLM: PMC3761781OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Artificial intelligenceOT  - feedbackOT  - machine learningOT  - pattern recognitionOT  - weight trainingEDAT- 2013/10/24 06:00MHDA- 2013/10/24 06:01CRDT- 2013/10/24 06:00PHST- 2013/03 [ecollection]PHST- 2012/06/29 [received]PHST- 2012/11/02 [accepted]PHST- 2013/03/01 [epublish]PST - epublishSO  - J Sports Sci Med. 2013 Mar 1;12(1):27-37. eCollection 2013.PMID- 24146715OWN - NLMSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINEDA  - 20131022DCOM- 20131022LR  - 20140124IS  - 1640-5544 (Print)IS  - 1640-5544 (Linking)VI  - 37DP  - 2013TI  - Game Indicators Determining Sports Performance in the NBA.PG  - 145-51LID - 10.2478/hukin-2013-0035 [doi]AB  - The main goal of the present study was to identify basketball game performance      indicators which best determine sports level in the National Basketball      Association (NBA) league. The research material consisted of all NBA game      statistics at the turn of eight seasons (2003-11) and included 52 performance      variables. Through detailed analysis the variables with high influence on game      effectiveness were selected for final procedures. It has been proven that a      limited number of factors, mostly offensive, determines sports performance in the      NBA. The most critical indicators are: Win%, Offensive EFF, 3rd Quarter PPG, Win%      CG, Avg Fauls and Avg Steals.

A panel of 10 experts in RT or sport pedagogy used a      Delphi technique to create a 90-question assessment (examination) that was      administered to 287 HS physical educators and sport coaches and 140 university      physical education teacher education (PETE) students. An analysis of the results       revealed that neither group demonstrated the minimal knowledge necessary to      design, implement, and supervise RT programs based on a passing score of 75%: HS       physical educators/coaches, mean = 59.30, SD = 14.30, 95% confidence interval      (CI) = 57.64-60.96], t(286) = -18.61, p = 0.000; university PETE students, mean =      56.61, SD = 16.59, 95% CI = 53.84-59.38, t(139) = -13.12, p = 0.000. The pass      rate for physical educators and sport coaches was 14.3% and for university PETE      students it was 20.7%. The results of this study indicate that both current and      preservice physical educators and sport coaches need additional education and      training specific to the design and implementation of RT programs for HS      students. Given that school districts typically require their educators attend      in-service training programs, it may be advisable to develop an in-service      program that allows both current and preservice HS physical educators and sport      coaches to earn an RT certification that specifically addresses the unique      physical and psychosocial needs of school-aged youth.FAU - McGladrey, Brian WAU  - McGladrey BWAD  - 1Health Promotion and Human Performance, Weber State University, Ogden, Utah;      2Exercise and Sport Science, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah; and      3Health and Exercise Science, The College of New Jersey, Ewing, New Jersey.FAU - Hannon, James CAU  - Hannon JCFAU - Faigenbaum, Avery DAU  - Faigenbaum ADFAU - Shultz, Barry BAU  - Shultz BBFAU - Shaw, Janet MAU  - Shaw JMLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Strength Cond ResJT  - Journal of strength and conditioning research / National Strength & Conditioning       AssociationJID - 9415084SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Cross-Sectional StudiesMH  - Delphi TechniqueMH  - FacultyMH  - FemaleMH  - *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, PracticeMH  - HumansMH  - Inservice TrainingMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - *Physical Education and TrainingMH  - Professional CompetenceMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Resistance Training/*methodsMH  - SchoolsMH  - Sports/*physiology/psychologyMH  - Students/psychologyEDAT- 2013/10/16 06:00MHDA- 2015/01/22 06:00CRDT- 2013/10/16 06:00AID - 10.1519/JSC.0000000000000265 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Strength Cond Res. 2014 May;28(5):1433-42. doi: 10.1519/JSC.0000000000000265.PMID- 24112774OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20140127DCOM- 20141020IS  - 1872-9126 (Electronic)IS  - 0003-6870 (Linking)VI  - 45IP  - 3DP  - 2014 MayTI  - Do the coach and athlete have the same "picture" of the situation?

It is argued that, from a schema-theoretic perspective, the      difference in these interpretations needs to be better understood. A      post-performance, self-confrontation, interview was conducted with a number of      athletes and their coaches. The interviews revealed differences between the      athlete and their coach in the information they are aware of. In comparison with       athletes, coaches more frequently compared the phenotype with genotype schemata      rather than just describing the phenotype schemata. Results suggest SA      information elements showed some common ground but also revealed some important      differences between the athlete and coach. The awareness was directed externally       towards the environment and internally, towards the individual, depending on      his/her role. The investigation showed that the schemata used to 'frame' the      information elements were different, but compatible, between athlete and coach.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.

Study 1 aimed       at eliciting these social barriers. Study 2 tested (i) whether self-efficacy      referring to social barriers would predict performance over and above      task-related self-efficacy and collective efficacy and (ii) the mediating role of      self-efficacy to overcome social barriers in the relationship between mindfulness      and performance. Participants were football (soccer) players aged 16-21 years      (Study 1: N=30; Study 2: N=101, longitudinal sample: n=88). Study 1 resulted in      eliciting 82 social barriers referring to team, peer leadership, and coaches.      Study 2 showed that task-related self-efficacy and collective efficacy explained       performance satisfaction at seven-month follow-up, whereas self-efficacy      referring to social barriers explained shooting performance at seven-month      follow-up. Indirect associations between mindfulness and performance were found      with three types of self-efficacy referring to social barriers, operating as      parallel mediators. Results provide evidence for the role of beliefs about the      ability to cope with social barriers and show a complex interplay between      different types of self-efficacy and collective efficacy in predicting team sport      performance.FAU - Blecharz, JanAU  - Blecharz JAD  - a University School of Physical Education , Cracow , Poland.FAU - Luszczynska, AleksandraAU  - Luszczynska AFAU - Scholz, UrteAU  - Scholz UFAU - Schwarzer, RalfAU  - Schwarzer RFAU - Siekanska, MalgorzataAU  - Siekanska MFAU - Cieslak, RomanAU  - Cieslak RLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20131004PL  - EnglandTA  - Anxiety Stress CopingJT  - Anxiety, stress, and copingJID - 9212242SB  - IMMH  - Adaptation, Psychological/*physiologyMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - Athletic Performance/*psychology/statistics & numerical dataMH  - Follow-Up StudiesMH  - HumansMH  - Interpersonal RelationsMH  - LeadershipMH  - Longitudinal StudiesMH  - MaleMH  - *MindfulnessMH  - Peer GroupMH  - *Personal SatisfactionMH  - Self EfficacyMH  - Soccer/*psychology/statistics & numerical dataMH  - *Social BehaviorMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2013/10/08 06:00MHDA- 2014/12/15 06:00CRDT- 2013/10/08 06:00PHST- 2013/10/04 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1080/10615806.2013.839989 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Anxiety Stress Coping. 2014 May;27(3):270-87. doi: 10.1080/10615806.2013.839989.

More and more evidence has accumulated that high-performance athletes are      not protected from mental disorders as previously thought. The authors discuss      the issue of the sport specificity of selected mental diseases in elite athletes.      Specific aspects of eating disorders, exercise addiction, chronic traumatic      encephalopathy and mood disorders in the context of overtraining syndrome are      examined. In particular, the interrelationship between life and work      characteristics unique to elite athletes and the development of mental disorders       are reviewed. Differences of clinical presentation and some therapeutic      consequences are discussed. The authors suggest that the physical and mental      strains endured by elite athletes might influence the onset and severity of their      psychiatric disorder. Beside the existing research strategies dealing with the      amount of exercise, its intensity and lack of recreation experienced by athletes,      further research on psycho-social factors is needed to better understand the      sport-specific aetiology of mental disorders in high-performance athletes.FAU - Bar, Karl-JurgenAU  - Bar KJAD  - Pain & Autonomic Integrative Research (PAIR), Department of Psychiatry and      Psychotherapy, University Hospital Jena, Philosophenweg 3, 07743, Jena, Germany,       Karl-Juergen.Baer@med.uni-jena.de.FAU - Markser, Valentin ZAU  - Markser VZLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20131004PL  - GermanyTA  - Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin NeurosciJT  - European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscienceJID - 9103030SB  - IMMH  - Athletes/*psychologyMH  - Behavior, Addictive/psychology/therapyMH  - Body WeightMH  - Boxing/injuries/psychologyMH  - Eating Disorders/psychology/therapyMH  - Exercise/psychologyMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Mental Disorders/*etiology/*therapyMH  - Mood Disorders/etiology/psychologyMH  - Psychiatry/*trendsMH  - Sports/*psychologyEDAT- 2013/10/05 06:00MHDA- 2014/05/30 06:00CRDT- 2013/10/05 06:00PHST- 2013/09/18 [received]PHST- 2013/09/19 [accepted]PHST- 2013/10/04 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1007/s00406-013-0458-4 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci. 2013 Nov;263 Suppl 2:S205-10. doi:      10.1007/s00406-013-0458-4.

We combined questionnaires (n = 60) and      semistructured interviews (n = 6) to assess the barriers that prevent      15-16-year-old girls from participating in extracurricular team games and what      can be done to overcome these barriers and improve physical activity levels. Four      barriers became prominent as to why girls in this sample do not participate:      Internal Factors, Existing Stereotypes, Other Hobbies and Teachers. Methods to      overcome these barriers were identified; changing teachers' attitudes and      shifting the media's focus away from male sport. Following the successful summer       Olympics and Paralympics in the UK, and the resulting positive focus on some of      the nation's female athletes, a shift in focus may be possible. However, this      needs to be maintained to allow girls more opportunities, role models and      motivation to participate in sport.FAU - Wetton, Abigail RAU  - Wetton ARAD  - Department of Sport, Exercise and Rehabilitation, Northumbria University,      Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 8ST, UK.FAU - Radley, RebeccaAU  - Radley RFAU - Jones, Angela RAU  - Jones ARFAU - Pearce, Mark SAU  - Pearce MSLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20130829PL  - United StatesTA  - Biomed Res IntJT  - BioMed research internationalJID - 101600173SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - *MotivationMH  - Qualitative ResearchMH  - *SportsPMC - PMC3773401OID - NLM: PMC3773401EDAT- 2013/09/28 06:00MHDA- 2014/04/16 06:00CRDT- 2013/09/28 06:00PHST- 2013/04/18 [received]PHST- 2013/07/31 [accepted]PHST- 2013/08/29 [epublish]AID - 10.1155/2013/738705 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Biomed Res Int. 2013;2013:738705. doi: 10.1155/2013/738705.

Long-term results for laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair, especially      data on health-related quality of life (HRQOL), are scant and there are no      available data whatsoever on HRQOL after SG. The main goal of this study was to      compare postoperative QOL data in the long term after transabdominal      preperitoneal hernioplasty (TAPP) in groin hernia and SG patients with QOL data      of a normal population. METHODS: This study included all patients (n = 559) who      underwent TAPP repair between 2000 and 2005. Forty seven patients (8.4 %) were      operated on for SG. We sent out the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36)      questionnaire for QOL evaluation. QOL data were compared with data from an age-      and sex-matched normal population. RESULTS: Ultimately, 383 completed      questionnaires were available for evaluation (69 % response rate). The mean      follow-up time was 94 +/- 20 months. In the SG group there were statistically      significant differences in three subscales of the SF-36 and the mental component       summary measure, showing better results for the SG group compared to the sex- and      age-matched normal group data. There were no statistically significant      differences between groin hernia patients and the sex- and age-matched normal      population. CONCLUSION: TAPP repair for SG as well as groin hernia results in      good HRQOL in the long term. Results for SG patients are comparable with QOL data      of a normal population or even better.FAU - Bernhardt, Gerwin AAU  - Bernhardt GAAD  - Division of General Surgery, Department of Surgery, Medical University of Graz,      Graz, Austria.FAU - Gruber, GeraldAU  - Gruber GFAU - Molderings, Benjamin SAU  - Molderings BSFAU - Cerwenka, HerwigAU  - Cerwenka HFAU - Glehr, MathiasAU  - Glehr MFAU - Giessauf, ChristianAU  - Giessauf CFAU - Kornprat, PeterAU  - Kornprat PFAU - Leithner, AndreasAU  - Leithner AFAU - Mischinger, Hans-JorgAU  - Mischinger HJLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20130906PL  - GermanyTA  - Surg EndoscJT  - Surgical endoscopyJID - 8806653SB  - IMEDAT- 2013/09/26 06:00MHDA- 2013/09/26 06:00CRDT- 2013/09/25 06:00PHST- 2013/04/17 [received]PHST- 2013/08/11 [accepted]PHST- 2013/09/06 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1007/s00464-013-3190-2 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Surg Endosc. 2014 Feb;28(2):439-46. doi: 10.1007/s00464-013-3190-2.

In Denmark, PE lessons take place in      co-educative classes, in England schools are more diverse, with predominantly      co-educational but also single-sex and faith schools offering different learning       contexts. Two case studies from Denmark and England are used to explore the      experiences of migrant Muslim girls in these different settings. A social      constructionist approach to gender underpins the interpretation of stakeholders'       voices on the inclusion of Muslim girls and the analysis of PE discourses in      these countries. Findings illustrate similarities and differences at the      interface of cultural diversity, political rhetoric of inclusion and realities of      sport experiences for Muslim girls in both countries. Complex influences on PE      experiences include gender stereotypes, cultural and religious orientations and      practices, as well as actions and expectations of parents, communities and      coaches/teachers. The studies provide insights into the ways participants managed      their identities as Muslim girls in different sport environments to enable      participation and retention of their cultural identities. Highlighted throughout       the paper are the ways in which school sport policy and practice, providers and      gatekeepers, can include or exclude groups, in this case Muslim girls. Too often       coaches and teachers are unaware of crucial facts about their learners, not only       in terms of their physical development and capabilities but also in terms of      their cultural needs. Mistakes in creating conducive learning environments leave       young people to negotiate a way to participate or refrain from participation.FAU - Benn, TansinAU  - Benn TAD  - a School of Humanities and Performing Arts , University of Plymouth , Plymouth ,       UK.FAU - Pfister, GertrudAU  - Pfister GLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Multicenter StudyDEP - 20130111PL  - EnglandTA  - Eur J Sport SciJT  - European journal of sport scienceJID - 101146739SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Adolescent Behavior/*ethnologyMH  - *Cultural DiversityMH  - DenmarkMH  - EnglandMH  - HumansMH  - *IslamMH  - MaleMH  - Physical Education and Training/*ethicsMH  - Schools/*ethicsMH  - Sports/*education/psychologyEDAT- 2013/09/21 06:00MHDA- 2014/09/03 06:00CRDT- 2013/09/21 06:00PHST- 2013/01/11 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1080/17461391.2012.757808 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur J Sport Sci. 2013;13(5):567-74. doi: 10.1080/17461391.2012.757808.

This study aimed to assess whether key messages      within these guidelines are reflected in the knowledge of coaches and sports      trainers involved in community sport. METHODS: An online knowledge survey was      widely promoted across Australia in May-August 2012 targeting community      Australian Football (AF) and Rugby League (RL) coaches and sports trainers. 260      AF coaches, 161 AF sports trainers, 267 RL coaches and 228 RL sports trainers      completed the survey. Knowledge scores were constructed from Likert scales and      compared across football codes and respondent groups. RESULTS: General concussion      knowledge did not differ across codes but sports trainers had higher levels than       did coaches. There were no significant differences in either concussion symptoms       or concussion management knowledge across codes or team roles. Over 90% of      respondents correctly identified five of the eight key signs or symptoms of      concussion. Fewer than 50% recognised the increased risk of another concussion      following an initial concussion. Most incorrectly believed or were uncertain that      scans typically show damage to the brain after a concussion occurs. Fewer than      25% recognised, and >40% were uncertain that younger players typically take      longer to recover from concussion than adults. CONCLUSIONS: The key messages from      published concussion management guidelines have not reached community sports      coaches and sports trainers. This needs to be redressed to maximise the safety of      all of those involved in community sport.FAU - White, Peta EAU  - White PEAD  - Centre for Healthy and Safe Sport, University of Ballarat, , Ballarat, Victoria,       Australia.FAU - Newton, Joshua DAU  - Newton JDFAU - Makdissi, MichaelAU  - Makdissi MFAU - Sullivan, S JohnAU  - Sullivan SJFAU - Davis, GavinAU  - Davis GFAU - McCrory, PaulAU  - McCrory PFAU - Donaldson, AlexAU  - Donaldson AFAU - Ewing, Michael TAU  - Ewing MTFAU - Finch, Caroline FAU  - Finch CFLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20130916PL  - EnglandTA  - Br J Sports MedJT  - British journal of sports medicineJID - 0432520SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Athletic Injuries/diagnosis/*therapyMH  - AustraliaMH  - Brain Concussion/diagnosis/*therapyMH  - ChecklistMH  - Clinical Competence/*standardsMH  - *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, PracticeMH  - HumansMH  - Practice Guidelines as TopicMH  - Sports Medicine/*standardsOTO - NOTNLMOT  - ConcussionOT  - Head injuriesEDAT- 2013/09/18 06:00MHDA- 2014/08/21 06:00CRDT- 2013/09/18 06:00PHST- 2013/09/16 [aheadofprint]AID - bjsports-2013-092785 [pii]AID - 10.1136/bjsports-2013-092785 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Br J Sports Med. 2014 Jan;48(2):119-24. doi: 10.1136/bjsports-2013-092785.

To identify dynamic informational constraints, which are      interwoven with individual and task constraints, coaches' experiential knowledge       provides a complementary source to support empirical understanding of performance      in sport. In this study, 15 expert coaches from 3 sports (track and field,      gymnastics and cricket) participated in a semi-structured interview process to      identify potential informational constraints which they perceived to regulate      action during run-up performance. Expert coaches' experiential knowledge revealed      multiple information sources which may constrain performance adaptations in such       locomotor pointing tasks. In addition to the locomotor pointing target, coaches'       knowledge highlighted two other key informational constraints: vertical reference      points located near the locomotor pointing target and a check mark located prior       to the locomotor pointing target. This study highlights opportunities for      broadening the understanding of perception and action coupling processes, and the      identified information sources warrant further empirical investigation as      potential constraints on athletic performance. Integration of experiential      knowledge of expert coaches with theoretically driven empirical knowledge      represents a promising avenue to drive future applied science research and      pedagogical practice.FAU - Greenwood, DanielAU  - Greenwood DAD  - a School of Exercise and Nutrition Science , Queensland University of Technology       , Brisbane , Australia.FAU - Davids, KeithAU  - Davids KFAU - Renshaw, IanAU  - Renshaw ILA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20130909PL  - EnglandTA  - J Sports SciJT  - Journal of sports sciencesJID - 8405364SB  - IMMH  - Athletic Performance/*physiology/psychologyMH  - *CognitionMH  - FemaleMH  - GymnasticsMH  - HumansMH  - Interviews as TopicMH  - KnowledgeMH  - MaleMH  - Movement/*physiologyMH  - *Professional CompetenceMH  - Psychomotor Performance/*physiologyMH  - RunningMH  - Sports/*physiology/statistics & numerical dataMH  - Track and FieldMH  - *Visual PerceptionEDAT- 2013/09/11 06:00MHDA- 2014/10/16 06:00CRDT- 2013/09/11 06:00PHST- 2013/09/09 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1080/02640414.2013.824599 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Sci. 2014;32(4):328-35. doi: 10.1080/02640414.2013.824599.

As predicted, global mental toughness was      associated with self-concept positivity, which was particularly high in      individuals with positive-integrative self-organisation (individuals who      distribute positive and negative self-attributes evenly across multiple selves).       Specifically, positive integration was associated with constancy (commitment to      goal achievement despite obstacles and the potential for failure), which extends       presumably from positive integratives' emotional stability and drive to resolve      negative self-beliefs.FAU - Meggs, JenniferAU  - Meggs JAD  - a Department of Sport and Exercise Psychology , Teesside University ,      Middlesbrough , UK.FAU - Ditzfeld, ChristopherAU  - Ditzfeld CFAU - Golby, JimAU  - Golby JLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20130822PL  - EnglandTA  - J Sports SciJT  - Journal of sports sciencesJID - 8405364SB  - IMMH  - *Adaptation, PsychologicalMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - AthletesMH  - Athletic Performance/*psychologyMH  - *Competitive BehaviorMH  - Cross-Sectional StudiesMH  - EmotionsMH  - HumansMH  - *IndividualityMH  - MotivationMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - *Resilience, PsychologicalMH  - *Self ConceptMH  - Self ReportMH  - Sports/*psychologyMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2013/08/24 06:00MHDA- 2014/10/15 06:00CRDT- 2013/08/24 06:00PHST- 2013/08/22 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1080/02640414.2013.812230 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Sci. 2014;32(2):101-9. doi: 10.1080/02640414.2013.812230.

However, the research      underpinning these PA guidelines does not address the element of social health.      Furthermore, there is insufficient evidence about the levels or types of PA      associated specifically with psychological health. This paper first presents the       results of a systematic review of the psychological and social health benefits of      participation in sport by children and adolescents. Secondly, the information      arising from the systematic review has been used to develop a conceptual model.      METHODS: A systematic review of 14 electronic databases was conducted in June      2012, and studies published since 1990 were considered for inclusion. Studies      that addressed mental and/or social health benefits from participation in sport      were included. RESULTS: A total of 3668 publications were initially identified,      of which 30 met the selection criteria. There were many different psychological      and social health benefits reported, with the most commonly being improved      self-esteem, social interaction followed by fewer depressive symptoms. Sport may       be associated with improved psychosocial health above and beyond improvements      attributable to participation in PA. Specifically, team sport seems to be      associated with improved health outcomes compared to individual activities, due      to the social nature of the participation. A conceptual model, Health through      Sport, is proposed. The model depicts the relationship between psychological,      psychosocial and social health domains, and their positive associations with      sport participation, as reported in the literature. However, it is acknowledged      that the capacity to determine the existence and direction of causal links      between participation and health is limited by the fact that the majority of      studies identified (n=21) were cross-sectional. CONCLUSION: It is recommended      that community sport participation is advocated as a form of leisure time PA for       children and adolescents, in an effort to not only improve physical health in      relation to such matters as the obesity crisis, but also to enhance psychological      and social health outcomes. It is also recommended that the causal link between      participation in sport and psychosocial health be further investigated and the      conceptual model of Health through Sport tested.FAU - Eime, Rochelle MAU  - Eime RMAD  - Institute of Sport, Exercise and Active Living, Victoria University, PO Box      14428, Melbourne, Victoria 8001, Australia. r.eime@ballarat.edu.auFAU - Young, Janet AAU  - Young JAFAU - Harvey, Jack TAU  - Harvey JTFAU - Charity, Melanie JAU  - Charity MJFAU - Payne, Warren RAU  - Payne WRLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPT  - ReviewDEP - 20130815PL  - EnglandTA  - Int J Behav Nutr Phys ActJT  - The international journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activityJID - 101217089SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - ChildMH  - Depression/*prevention & controlMH  - *Exercise/psychologyMH  - *HealthMH  - Health BehaviorMH  - HumansMH  - *Interpersonal RelationsMH  - *Personal SatisfactionMH  - *Self ConceptMH  - *Sports/psychologyPMC - PMC3751802OID - NLM: PMC3751802EDAT- 2013/08/16 06:00MHDA- 2013/11/19 06:00CRDT- 2013/08/16 06:00PHST- 2012/12/10 [received]PHST- 2013/08/12 [accepted]PHST- 2013/08/15 [aheadofprint]AID - 1479-5868-10-98 [pii]AID - 10.1186/1479-5868-10-98 [doi]PST - epublishSO  - Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act. 2013 Aug 15;10:98. doi: 10.1186/1479-5868-10-98.PMID- 23930553OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20130812DCOM- 20130919IS  - 0270-1367 (Print)IS  - 0270-1367 (Linking)VI  - 84IP  - 2DP  - 2013 JunTI  - Do coaches orchestrate? The working practices of elite Portuguese coaches.PG  - 263-72AB  - PURPOSE: Although the concept of orchestration has resonated well with coaches      and students of coaching, it remains quite an immature theorization lacking      empirical evidence. Consequently, the purpose of this study was to explore the      practice of expert Portuguese coaches from the perspective of orchestration. The       specific objectives related to examining if and how coaches manipulate contexts      and relationships toward desired ends, if and how they steer and/or stage-manage       events, and precisely what informs their actions. METHODS: Data were gathered      through a series of semi-structured interviews with 5 top-level Portuguese      coaches from a variety of sports. The coaches were selected through purposive      sampling. The interviews were taped and transcribed verbatim so that an accurate       record of the data gathered was obtained. The data were subject to both inductive      and deductive examination through a process of thematic analysis. RESULTS: The      categorical themes resulting from the process of data analysis included (a) the      need amongst the coaches "for stakeholder buy-in," (b) "generating an illusion of      empowerment" among both staff and athletes to ensure compliance, (c) "scaffolding      the context to create a controlled instability" and (d) "detailed noticing to      inform action." CONCLUSION: The coaches featured in this study were found to      carefully and strategically consider their actions and behaviors; particularly      concerning the generation of others' compliance and respect. Consequently, in      giving further credence to the notions of power, social obligation, and the      flexible scaffolding of learning, the findings support the notion that the      concept of orchestration deserves further exploration and development in order to      better understand the coach's role.FAU - Santos, SofiaAU  - Santos SAD  - Cardiff Metropolitan University, Cyncoed Campus, Cyncoed Road, Cardiff, CF23 6XD,      United Kingdom. ssantos@cardiffmet.ac.ukFAU - Jones, Robyn LAU  - Jones RLFAU - Mesquita, IsabelAU  - Mesquita ILA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - United StatesTA  - Res Q Exerc SportJT  - Research quarterly for exercise and sportJID - 8006373SB  - IMMH  - *Athletic PerformanceMH  - HumansMH  - Interviews as TopicMH  - *LeadershipMH  - MaleMH  - PortugalMH  - RoleMH  - Sports/*educationMH  - *TeachingEDAT- 2013/08/13 06:00MHDA- 2013/09/21 06:00CRDT- 2013/08/13 06:00AID - 10.1080/02701367.2013.784722 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Res Q Exerc Sport. 2013 Jun;84(2):263-72.PMID- 23914509OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20130806DCOM- 20130827IS  - 0350-6134 (Print)IS  - 0350-6134 (Linking)VI  - 37 Suppl 2DP  - 2013 MayTI  - Differential analysis of the doping behaviour templates in three types of sports.PG  - 211-7AB  - Conducted researches recognize various risk factors, as well as protective      factors against doping behaviour in different sports i.e. sports disciplines or      activities. The main goal of this research was to identify the correlation      between selected socio-demographic, health-related, and sports-related predictors      with doping factors in three different types of sports, which are (1) highly      energetic demanding sports (weightlifting), (2) highly technical demanding sports      (racquet sports), and (3) highly tactical demanding sports (sailing). The      research consisted of three separate studies, each one of them researching one of      the sports. The sample of subjects included altogether 293 athletes, senior level      competitors (older than 18years of age). In total, the sample comprised three      homogenous sub-samples, as follows: athletes in highly energetic demanding sports      (weightlifters and power lifters; N=27), athletes in highly technical demanding      sports (table tennis, tennis and badminton players; N=188), and athletes in      highly tactical demanding sports (sailing; N=78). The first study involved      weightlifters where we should point out the existence of high doping behaviour In      this study, religiousness was interpreted as the most significant protective      factor against doping behaviour, while sports factors are not found to be      significantly related to doping. The study involving racquet sport athletes      suggests a high risk of doping behaviour among those athletes who observe doping       behaviour in their sport. We noticed low levels of athletes' trust in their      coaches' and physicians' opinions on doping issues. This is an issue which should      be researched in the future, because the underlying cause has not been studied as      yet. Briefly, it seems that either the athletes are not convinced of their      coaches '/physicians' expertise regarding doping issues, and/or they do not      believe in their good intentions. It is particularly important, as the previous      research has shown that with the increased trust in coaches and physicians, the      chance that an athlete will use doping decreases. As expected, it is      characteristic for sailing that it has a low likelihood of potential doping      behaviour, although the consumption of dietary supplements is high. Substance      abuse in sports spreads beyond those that enhance athletic performance. All of      these issues should be studied in more detail in the future and, if appropriately      validated, incorporated into anti-doping intervention programs.FAU - Rodek, JelenaAU  - Rodek JAD  - University of Split, Faculty of Kinesiology, Split, Croatia.      jelena.rodek@kifst.hrFAU - Idrizovic, KemalAU  - Idrizovic KFAU - Zenic, NatasaAU  - Zenic NFAU - Perasovic, BenjaminAU  - Perasovic BFAU - Kondric, MiranAU  - Kondric MLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - CroatiaTA  - Coll AntropolJT  - Collegium antropologicumJID - 8003354SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Athletes/*psychologyMH  - AttitudeMH  - *Dietary SupplementsMH  - Doping in Sports/*psychology/statistics & numerical dataMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Racquet Sports/*psychology/statistics & numerical dataMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Ships/statistics & numerical dataMH  - Socioeconomic FactorsMH  - Weight Lifting/*psychology/statistics & numerical dataMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2013/08/07 06:00MHDA- 2013/08/28 06:00CRDT- 2013/08/07 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Coll Antropol. 2013 May;37 Suppl 2:211-7.PMID- 23914506OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20130806DCOM- 20130827IS  - 0350-6134 (Print)IS  - 0350-6134 (Linking)VI  - 37 Suppl 2DP  - 2013 MayTI  - Sport nutrition and doping factors in swimming; parallel analysis among athletes       and coaches.PG  - 179-86AB  - The sport nutrition and doping are known to be important issues in sports, but      there is evident lack of studies which investigated those issues in swimming,      especially with regard to parallel analysis of coaches and athletes. The first      aim of this study was to compare knowledge of swimming coaches and their athletes      about nutrition and doping. Also, we have identified interrelationships between      studied sociodemographic-, sport-; nutrition- and doping-related-factors. The      sample of subjects comprised 55 athletes (20.3 +/- 2.2 years of age; 24 females)       and 22 coaches (mean age 36.5 +/- 7.8 years; 4 females) from Croatia (98% of      respondents). In the first phase of the investigation we have validated specific       questionnaires to determine the knowledge of sport nutrition (KSN), and knowledge      on doping (KD). The test-retest correlation and percentage of equally responded      queries revealed both questionnaires as reliable. The discriminative validity was      proven also since coaches scored better than their athletes on both      questionnaires. Athletes declared their coaches as the primary sources of      knowledge about nutrition and doping. Among coaches, formal and self-education      are equally important sources of information about doping and nutrition. The age       is negatively, while the formal education is positively correlated to KD and KSN       scores among coaches. Consequently, permanent educational programs about      nutrition and doping are emphasized, especially among older coaches and younger      athletes.FAU - Sajber, DoricaAU  - Sajber DAD  - University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Sport, Ljubljana, Slovenia.FAU - Rodek, JelenaAU  - Rodek JFAU - Escalante, YolandaAU  - Escalante YFAU - Olujic, DraganaAU  - Olujic DFAU - Sekulic, DamirAU  - Sekulic DLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - CroatiaTA  - Coll AntropolJT  - Collegium antropologicumJID - 8003354SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Athletes/psychologyMH  - Athletic Performance/*physiology/*psychologyMH  - *AttitudeMH  - CroatiaMH  - *Dietary SupplementsMH  - Doping in Sports/*psychologyMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Physical Education and TrainingMH  - Swimming/education/*psychologyMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2013/08/07 06:00MHDA- 2013/08/28 06:00CRDT- 2013/08/07 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Coll Antropol. 2013 May;37 Suppl 2:179-86.PMID- 23893420OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20130930DCOM- 20140520IS  - 1552-3365 (Electronic)IS  - 0363-5465 (Linking)VI  - 41IP  - 10DP  - 2013 OctTI  - Development and validation of a pediatric sports activity rating scale: the      Hospital for Special Surgery Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale (HSS      Pedi-FABS).PG  - 2421-9LID - 10.1177/0363546513496548 [doi]AB  - BACKGROUND: Having simple and reliable validated outcome measures is vital to      conducting high-quality outcomes research in the field of orthopaedic surgery.      Activity level is a key prognostic variable for patients with sports injuries.      There is a paucity of such activity scales for children and adolescents who are      otherwise healthy and athletically active. In addition to frequency and intensity      of athletic activity, level of play and coach/trainer supervision are important      variables unique to children and adolescents that are not captured in available      adult scoring systems. PURPOSE: To create and validate a concise and      comprehensive activity rating scale for athletically active children and      adolescents 10 to 18 years of age. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study (diagnosis); Level       of evidence, 2. METHODS: Item generation was performed with a panel of      orthopaedic surgeons and adolescent athletes. Item reduction, pilot testing and      scale refinement resulted in a final 8-item instrument, the Hospital for Special       Surgery Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale (HSS Pedi-FABS). Existing      methods were used to determine reliability and validation. The Flesch-Kincaid      score was calculated at a 6.6th-grade reading level (approximately 13 years old);      therefore, although all subjects provided their own answers, parents were allowed      to assist children younger than 13 years with reading the questionnaire. RESULTS:      Scale reliability was excellent (test-retest reliability, intraclass correlation       coefficient = 0.91; internal consistency, Cronbach alpha = .914), and there were       no floor or ceiling effects. There was also robust construct validity: Convergent      validity testing revealed positive correlations between the HSS Pedi-FABS and      level of competition in athletic activity, number of reported hours of athletic      activity per week, and existing comparable adult and pediatric scales.      Discriminant validity was shown with age, body mass index, and type of sport as      measured by the Daniel scale. CONCLUSION: The 8-item HSS Pedi-FABS can be used to      reliably and accurately evaluate activity level as a prognostic variable for      clinical research studies. It is a simple, reliable, and valid metric to assess      activity in children and adolescents 10 to 18 years of age. This instrument will       lead to better evaluation of posttreatment outcomes and patient-reported activity      for child and adolescent athletes.FAU - Fabricant, Peter DAU  - Fabricant PDAD  - Peter D.

This condition is an interrelated      multifactorial syndrome which includes low energy availability, menstrual cycle      disturbances and decreased bone mineral density. OBJECTIVE: To review the major      components of the FAT and their relationships, as well as strategies for      diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: Articles related to the topic were reviewed      through PubMed and SportDiscus databases. RESULTS: Interrelationship between      components of the FAT may result in clinical manifestations, including eating      disorders, amenorrhea and osteoporosis. Clinical conditions are not always      exhibited simultaneously. Prevention is important to minimize complications.      Diagnosis and treatment is complicated and often must involve an      interdisciplinary therapeutic approach. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding of the disease      may be facilitated by a unified framework focusing on energy deficiency.      Preventive or early interventions require to increase energy availability through      a higher total energy intake or a decrease in energy expenditure trough excessive      physical exercise. A healthy lifestyle, and support by parents and coaches should      be included. Psychotherapy may be necessary when eating disorders are present.CI  - Copyright (c) AULA MEDICA EDICIONES 2013.

Much of the available       information on this subject has been collected from sedentary subjects or      low-level competitors, often without well matched controls. Other issues      requiring clearer definition include the duration of fasting, the local      environment, the timing of observations, and changes in training, diet and sleep       patterns. Sleep may be shortened or made good with daytime naps. Circadian      rhythms of temperature, metabolism, hormonal secretions and physical performance       may be disrupted and incidental activities curtailed. Disturbances of psychomotor      performance include daytime sleepiness, impaired vigilance and slower reactions.       Food intake is limited to night-time meals. Sedentary individuals sometimes      exploit Ramadan to reduce body fat stores. Well disciplined athletes usually      maintain energy balance unless daily energy expenditures are very high. Protein      intake must allow for gluconeogenesis, and provide quality protein ingested      around training times. Blood sugar levels are likely to fall over a long and      active day, even if morning glycogen reserves are maximized. Metabolism of fat      should be encouraged, beginning prior to Ramadan; inclusion of fat in the      pre-dawn meal also slows gastric emptying. Daytime fluid depletion is inevitable       if athletes exercise in the heat, but the immediate deficit can usually be made      good at night. Some studies show an initial fluid depletion, with recovery as      Ramadan continues, possibly reflecting changes in urine and sweat production. Top      athletes can maintain training throughout Ramadan, although coaches sometimes      reduce demands through a pre-competitive tapering of effort. Late night or early       morning training requires negotiation with players who are not observing Ramadan,      and dietary adjustments to maintain optimal plasma amino acid levels when      training. Performance of repeated anaerobic exercise is impaired, but aerobic      power and muscular strength show little change during Ramadan. Ratings of fatigue      are increased, and vigilance and reaction times are impaired, particularly during      the afternoon. Medical issues during Ramadan are few. Athletes with diabetes      mellitus should seek a medical exemption from fasting, and prescribed drug      schedules should be carefully maintained. There is no major increase of injury      rates, but competitors may have difficulty in producing urine for doping      controls. Logical measures to minimize the effects of Ramadan include the      optimization of mood state, maintenance of training, minimization of sleep loss,       appropriate adjustments of diet, and the monitoring of competitors for chronic      dehydration. Future research should concentrate on the changes observed in top      athletes, particularly women, with data collected in the late afternoon after a      known period of fasting in a well defined environment. It will be important to      ensure that the lifestyle of those studied has been optimized. Implications of      chronic dehydration for doping control also merit further investigation. Current       data suggest that the impact of Ramadan upon athletic performance is small      relative to the precision of test procedures, although it may be sufficient to      cause a loss of medals. Negative effects vary widely with the type of sport, the       season when fasting is observed, the local culture and the discipline exercised      by the athlete.FAU - Shephard, Roy JAU  - Shephard RJAD  - Faculty of Kinesiology and Physical Education, University of Toronto, Toronto,      ON, Canada, royjshep@shaw.ca.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - New ZealandTA  - Sports MedJT  - Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)JID - 8412297SB  - IMMH  - Adaptation, Physiological/*physiologyMH  - AthletesMH  - Athletic Performance/*physiologyMH  - Circadian RhythmMH  - Exercise/*physiologyMH  - Fasting/*physiologyMH  - HumansMH  - *IslamMH  - Sports/*physiologyEDAT- 2013/07/28 06:00MHDA- 2014/07/18 06:00CRDT- 2013/07/27 06:00AID - 10.1007/s40279-013-0080-7 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Sports Med. 2013 Dec;43(12):1217-41. doi: 10.1007/s40279-013-0080-7.PMID- 23824837OWN - NLMSTAT- In-ProcessDA  - 20141110IS  - 1573-3602 (Electronic)IS  - 1050-5350 (Linking)VI  - 30IP  - 4DP  - 2014 DecTI  - Examining the structural relationships among gambling motivation, passion, and      consequences of internet sports betting.PG  - 845-58LID - 10.1007/s10899-013-9400-y [doi]AB  - The rise in popularity of Internet gambling has led to new gambling controversies      among researchers and policymakers alike. Opponents frequently point to the      negative impacts of problem gambling, while advocates tend to view this form of      gambling as relatively harmless and convenient entertainment for the vast      majority of participants. Interestingly, in making their points, both sides cite       empirical arguments about passion for the gambling act-with opponents arguing      that Internet gambling enables unhealthy obsessions, and advocates pointing to      the apparent intensive interest of large numbers of Internet players. As it turns      out, both sides may have a point. In this paper, we examine whether types of      passion were related to types of motivation and consequences. The data were      collected through a sample from an online gambling website in South Korea. We      rely upon Rousseau et al.'s (J Gambl Stud 18(1):45-66, 2002) seminal work on      positive and negative aspects of passion, and in the process we develop a      framework for understanding positive and negative consequences of this form of      gambling. The results reveal that intrinsic gambling motivations (e.g., gambling       for excitement) is related to harmonious passion, which in turn results in      positive consequences.

Participants attended an introductory session and baseline testing in week       one, participated in once-weekly group circuit exercise and lifestyle education      sessions for 10 weeks and attended post-testing and project evaluation in week      12. RESULTS: Fourteen participants completed the project. Healthy lifestyle      knowledge did not improve significantly. As a combined group there were      significant improvements in both physical and mental components of the SF12      questionnaire and in waist girth. The rugby league cohort achieved significant      improvement in the SF12 physical component, weight, BMI and waist girth. The      rugby union cohort achieved significant improvement in the SF12 mental component       and waist girth. Participants reported a variety of health improvement and      lifestyle changes following the project and reported appreciation at the      involvement of the sporting club. CONCLUSIONS: The men's lifestyle program      resulted in significant improvement in body composition, resulting in a reduction      in obesity-related disease risk in some participants.FAU - Sealey, Rebecca MareeAU  - Sealey RMAD  - School of Public Health, Tropical Medicine and Rehabilitation Sciences, James      Cook University, Townsville, Queensland, Australia. rebecca.sealey@jcu.edu.auFAU - Twomey, JulieAU  - Twomey JFAU - Pringle, Fiona AlyceAU  - Pringle FAFAU - Cheffins, TracyAU  - Cheffins TFAU - Gupta, SmitaAU  - Gupta SLA  - engPT  - Evaluation StudiesPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20130626PL  - EnglandTA  - Aging MaleJT  - The aging male : the official journal of the International Society for the Study       of the Aging MaleJID - 9808210SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Fitness CentersMH  - Focus GroupsMH  - *Health PromotionMH  - HumansMH  - *Life StyleMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Obesity/*therapyMH  - Pilot ProjectsMH  - Program EvaluationMH  - QueenslandMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - *Risk Reduction BehaviorMH  - Waist CircumferenceEDAT- 2013/06/28 06:00MHDA- 2014/03/15 06:00CRDT- 2013/06/28 06:00PHST- 2013/06/26 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.3109/13685538.2013.805320 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Aging Male. 2013 Sep;16(3):118-22. doi: 10.3109/13685538.2013.805320.

Insights from an ecological dynamics      approach to team coordination in sports.PG  - 765-72LID - 10.1007/s40279-013-0070-9 [doi]AB  - Previous research has proposed that team coordination is based on shared      knowledge of the performance context, responsible for linking teammates' mental      representations for collective, internalized action solutions. However, this      representational approach raises many questions including: how do individual      schemata of team members become reformulated together? How much time does it take      for this collective cognitive process to occur? How do different cues perceived      by different individuals sustain a general shared mental representation? This      representational approach is challenged by an ecological dynamics perspective of       shared knowledge in team coordination. We argue that the traditional shared      knowledge assumption is predicated on 'knowledge about' the environment, which      can be used to share knowledge and influence intentions of others prior to      competition. Rather, during competitive performance, the control of action by      perceiving surrounding informational constraints is expressed in 'knowledge of'      the environment. This crucial distinction emphasizes perception of shared      affordances (for others and of others) as the main communication channel between       team members during team coordination tasks. From this perspective, the emergence      of coordinated behaviours in sports teams is based on the formation of      interpersonal synergies between players resulting from collective actions      predicated on shared affordances.FAU - Silva, PedroAU  - Silva PAD  - CIFI2D, Centre of Research, Education, Innovation and Intervention in Sport,      Faculdade de Desporto, Universidade do Porto, Rua Dr. Placido Costa, 91, 4200-450      Porto, Portugal. psilv@icloud.comFAU - Garganta, JulioAU  - Garganta JFAU - Araujo, DuarteAU  - Araujo DFAU - Davids, KeithAU  - Davids KFAU - Aguiar, PauloAU  - Aguiar PLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - New ZealandTA  - Sports MedJT  - Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)JID - 8412297SB  - IMMH  - Athletic Performance/*psychologyMH  - CognitionMH  - Competitive BehaviorMH  - *Cooperative BehaviorMH  - EnvironmentMH  - HumansMH  - IntentionMH  - *KnowledgeMH  - Models, PsychologicalMH  - Sports/*psychologyEDAT- 2013/06/26 06:00MHDA- 2014/04/23 06:00CRDT- 2013/06/25 06:00AID - 10.1007/s40279-013-0070-9 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Sports Med. 2013 Sep;43(9):765-72. doi: 10.1007/s40279-013-0070-9.PMID- 23790995OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20130624DCOM- 20140210IS  - 1873-2607 (Electronic)IS  - 0749-3797 (Linking)VI  - 45IP  - 1DP  - 2013 JulTI  - One-year follow-up of a coach-delivered dating violence prevention program: a      cluster randomized controlled trial.PG  - 108-12LID - 10.1016/j.amepre.2013.03.007 [doi]LID - S0749-3797(13)00214-6 [pii]AB  - BACKGROUND: Perpetration of physical, sexual, and psychological abuse is      prevalent in adolescent relationships. One strategy for reducing such violence is      to increase the likelihood that youth will intervene when they see peers engaging      in disrespectful and abusive behaviors. PURPOSE: This 12-month follow-up of a      cluster RCT examined the longer-term effectiveness of Coaching Boys Into Men, a      dating violence prevention program targeting high school male athletes. DESIGN:      This cluster RCT was conducted from 2009 to 2011. The unit of randomization was      the school, and the unit of analysis was the athlete. Data were analyzed in 2012.      SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Participants were male athletes in Grades 9-11 (N=1513)      participating in athletics in 16 high schools. INTERVENTION: The intervention      consisted of training athletic coaches to integrate violence prevention messages       into coaching activities through brief, weekly, scripted discussions with      athletes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were intentions to intervene,      recognition of abusive behaviors, and gender-equitable attitudes. Secondary      outcomes included bystander behaviors and abuse perpetration. Intervention      effects were expressed as adjusted mean between-arm differences in changes in      outcomes over time, estimated via regression models for clustered, longitudinal      data. RESULTS: Perpetration of dating violence in the past 3 months was less      prevalent among intervention athletes relative to control athletes, resulting in       an estimated intervention effect of -0.15 (95% CI=-0.27, -0.03). Intervention      athletes also reported lower levels of negative bystander behaviors (i.e.,      laughing and going along with peers' abusive behaviors) compared to controls      (-0.41, 95% CI=-0.72, -0.10). No differences were observed in intentions to      intervene (0.04, 95% CI=-0.07, 0.16); gender-equitable attitudes (-0.04, 95%      CI=-0.11, 0.04); recognition of abusive behaviors (-0.03, 95% CI=-0.15, 0.09); or      positive bystander behaviors (0.04, 95% CI=-0.11, 0.19). CONCLUSIONS: This school      athletics-based dating violence prevention program is a promising approach to      reduce perpetration and negative bystander behaviors that condone dating violence      among male athletes.

METHODS: The present study employed the TRA/TPB to develop a      cross-sectional survey to examine contributors to intention to report concussion       symptoms. High school athletes (n = 167, age = 15.7 +/- 1.4) completed this      survey. The TRA/TPB constructs of attitude (perceptions about concussion      reporting), subjective norm (perception of important social referents beliefs      about concussion reporting), perceived behavioural control (perceived control      over concussion reporting) and intention to report concussion symptoms served as       the independent variables. Linear regression models were used to predict      intention to report concussion symptoms. Binomial regression models were used to       predict concussion-reporting behaviours from intention. RESULTS: Direct attitude,      subjective norm and direct perceived behavioural control were all associated with      intention to report concussion. Intention was associated with decreased      prevalence of participating in practices and games while symptomatic from      concussion. CONCLUSIONS: Favourable attitudes toward reporting and social      referents' beliefs have the greatest impact on intention to report concussion      symptoms. Reporting intention may not always be an indicator of      concussion-reporting behaviours. Concussion education initiatives should focus on      improving attitudes and beliefs among athletes, coaches and parents to promote      better care-seeking behaviours among young athletes.FAU - Register-Mihalik, Johna KAU  - Register-Mihalik JKAD  - Clinical Research Unit, Emergency Services Institute, WakeMed Health and      Hospitals, Raleigh, NC 27610, USA. jmihalik@wakemed.orgFAU - Linnan, Laura AAU  - Linnan LAFAU - Marshall, Stephen WAU  - Marshall SWFAU - Valovich McLeod, Tamara CAU  - Valovich McLeod TCFAU - Mueller, Frederick OAU  - Mueller FOFAU - Guskiewicz, Kevin MAU  - Guskiewicz KMLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Multicenter StudyPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20130619PL  - EnglandTA  - Brain InjJT  - Brain injuryJID - 8710358SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Athletes/*psychology/*statistics & numerical dataMH  - Athletic Injuries/*epidemiology/prevention & control/psychologyMH  - Brain Concussion/*epidemiology/prevention & control/psychologyMH  - Cross-Sectional StudiesMH  - FemaleMH  - Health BehaviorMH  - Health Knowledge, Attitudes, PracticeMH  - HumansMH  - *IntentionMH  - MaleMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - SchoolsMH  - *Self ReportMH  - United States/epidemiologyEDAT- 2013/06/26 06:00MHDA- 2014/03/07 06:00CRDT- 2013/06/25 06:00PHST- 2013/06/19 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.3109/02699052.2013.775508 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Brain Inj. 2013;27(7-8):878-86. doi: 10.3109/02699052.2013.775508.

DESIGN: The substantive focus was the      emerging role for, and particularly the measurement of, athletes' evaluations of       their coach's competency within conceptual models of effective coaching. The      methodological focus was exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM), a      methodology that integrates the advantages of exploratory factor analysis and      confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) within the general structural equation model.       METHOD: The synergy was a demonstration of when a new and flexible methodological      framework, ESEM, may be preferred as compared to a more familiar and restrictive       methodological framework, CFA, by reanalyzing existing data. RESULTS: ESEM      analysis on extant datasets suggested that for responses to the Athletes'      Perceptions of Coaching Competency Scale II - High School Teams (APCCS II-HST), a      CFA model based on the relevant literature plus one post hoc modification,      offered a viable alternative to a more complex ESEM model. For responses to the      Coaching Competency Scale (CCS), a CFA model based on the relevant literature did      not offer a viable alternative to a more complex ESEM model. CONCLUSIONS: The      ESEM framework should be strongly considered in subsequent studies validity      studies - for new and/or existing instruments in the psychology of sport and      exercise. A key consideration for deciding between ESEM and the accompanying      rotation criterion and CFA in future validity studies should be level of a priori      measurement theory.FAU - Myers, Nicholas DAU  - Myers NDAD  - Department of Educational and Psychological Studies, University of Miami.LA  - ENGGR  - UL1 TR000460/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLETA  - Psychol Sport ExercJT  - Psychology of sport and exerciseJID - 101088724PMC - PMC3686321MID - NIHMS479128OTO - NOTNLMOT  - athlete's evaluationsOT  - categorical dataOT  - coaching effectivenessOT  - geominOT  - targetEDAT- 2013/06/25 06:00MHDA- 2013/06/25 06:00CRDT- 2013/06/25 06:00AID - 10.1016/j.psychsport.2013.04.008 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Psychol Sport Exerc. 2013 Sep;14(5):709-718.PMID- 23781910OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20131101DCOM- 20140627IS  - 1464-5165 (Electronic)IS  - 0963-8288 (Linking)VI  - 35IP  - 24DP  - 2013TI  - Psychosocial outcomes of an inclusive adapted sport and adventurous training      course for military personnel.PG  - 2081-8LID - 10.3109/09638288.2013.802376 [doi]AB  - PURPOSE: To explore the psychosocial outcomes of an inclusive adapted sport and      adventurous training course that aims to support the rehabilitation and personal       development of military personnel who have sustained physical and/or      psychological disability. METHOD: Narrative life story interviews were conducted       with 11 men aged 20-43 taking part in one of the 5-day courses. A thematic      narrative analysis was conducted, focusing on accounts that provided insights      into personally meaningful psychosocial outcomes of the course. FINDINGS: We      identified six themes, falling into two distinct clusters. "Bringing me back to      myself" was achieved through the themes of (1) returning to activity, (2)      rediscovering a sense of purpose, and (3) reconnecting to others. "New rooms to      explore" was realised through (4) experiencing new activities, (5) being      valued/respected/cared for and (6) being inspired by other people. CONCLUSION:      Involvement in the course stimulated a balance of present- and future-oriented      psychosocial outcomes through which participants both recreated aspects of      themselves that had been lost through injury/trauma and moved forward with their       lives as a result of new horizons of possibility. IMPLICATIONS FOR      REHABILITATION: This 5-day inclusive adapted sport and adventurous training      course offered meaningful psychosocial outcomes among military personnel who had       experienced physical and/or psychological disability. The course helped      participants recover aspects of their previous life and self through becoming      physically active again, rediscovering a sense of purpose and reconnecting to      others. Participants describe a broadening of life horizons as a result of the      course, through new activities, being valued/respected/cared for, and being      inspired by other people.FAU - Carless, DavidAU  - Carless DAD  - Leeds Metropolitan University , Leeds , United Kingdom.FAU - Peacock, SuzanneAU  - Peacock SFAU - McKenna, JimAU  - McKenna JFAU - Cooke, CarltonAU  - Cooke CLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20130619PL  - EnglandTA  - Disabil RehabilJT  - Disability and rehabilitationJID - 9207179SB  - IMMH  - Adaptation, PsychologicalMH  - AdultMH  - Disabled Persons/psychology/rehabilitationMH  - Exercise/psychologyMH  - Great BritainMH  - HumansMH  - Interviews as TopicMH  - Life StyleMH  - MaleMH  - Mental Disorders/psychology/*rehabilitationMH  - Military Personnel/*psychologyMH  - NarrationMH  - Physical Education and Training/*methodsMH  - *Self ConceptMH  - *Social IdentificationMH  - Social ValuesMH  - Sports/*psychologyMH  - Stress, Psychological/etiology/psychology/*rehabilitationMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - Wounds and Injuries/complications/psychology/rehabilitationMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2013/06/21 06:00MHDA- 2014/06/28 06:00CRDT- 2013/06/21 06:00PHST- 2013/06/19 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.3109/09638288.2013.802376 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Disabil Rehabil. 2013;35(24):2081-8. doi: 10.3109/09638288.2013.802376.

Sports like rugby, basketball, lacrosse, and others require      athletes to be not only strong and powerful but also aerobically fit and able to       recover from high-intensity intermittent exercise. This provides coaches and      sport scientists with a complex range of variables to consider when developing      training programs. This can often lead to confusion and the misuse of training      modalities, particularly in the development of aerobic and anaerobic      conditioning. This review outlines the benefits and general adaptations to 3      commonly used and effective conditioning methods: high-intensity interval      training, repeated-sprint training, and small-sided games. The goals and outcomes      of these training methods are discussed, and practical implementations strategies      for coaches and sport scientists are provided.FAU - Hoffmann, James J JrAU  - Hoffmann JJ JrAD  - Dept of Exercise & Sport Science, East Tennessee State University, Johnson City,       TN.FAU - Reed, Jacob PAU  - Reed JPFAU - Leiting, KeithAU  - Leiting KFAU - Chiang, Chieh-YingAU  - Chiang CYFAU - Stone, Michael HAU  - Stone MHLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20130522PL  - United StatesTA  - Int J Sports Physiol PerformJT  - International journal of sports physiology and performanceJID - 101276430SB  - IMMH  - Adaptation, PhysiologicalMH  - *Athletic PerformanceMH  - HumansMH  - Models, BiologicalMH  - *Muscle ContractionMH  - Muscle, Skeletal/*physiologyMH  - Physical Conditioning, Human/*methodsMH  - Recovery of FunctionMH  - *RunningMH  - Task Performance and AnalysisMH  - Time FactorsMH  - *Track and FieldEDAT- 2013/06/12 06:00MHDA- 2014/04/09 06:00CRDT- 2013/06/12 06:00PHST- 2013/05/22 [aheadofprint]AID - 2013-0189 [pii]AID - 10.1123/ijspp.2013-0189 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Int J Sports Physiol Perform. 2014 Mar;9(2):352-7. doi: 10.1123/ijspp.2013-0189.

Because of the complex and multifaceted nature of this      sport, multivariate statistics were applied in the study. The subjects included      thirty experienced sport climbers. Forty three variables were scrutinised, namely      somatic characteristics, specific physical fitness, coordination abilities,      aerobic and anaerobic power, technical and tactical skills, mental      characteristics, as well as 2 variables describing the climber's performance in      the OS (Max OS) and RP style (Max RP). The results show that for training      effectiveness of advanced climbers to be thoroughly analysed and examined, tests       assessing their physical, technical and mental characteristics are necessary. The      three sets of variables used in this study explained the structure of performance      similarly, but not identically (in 38, 33 and 25%, respectively). They were also       complementary to around 30% of the variance. The overall performance capacity of       a sport rock climber (Max OS and Max RP) was also evaluated in the study. The      canonical weights of the dominant first canonical root were 0.554 and 0.512 for      Max OS and Max RP, respectively. Despite the differences between the two styles      of climbing, seven variables - the maximal relative strength of the fingers      (canonical weight = 0.490), mental endurance (one of scales : The Formal      Characteristics of Behaviour-Temperament Inventory (FCB-TI; Strelau and Zawadzki,      1995)) (-0.410), climbing technique (0.370), isometric endurance of the fingers      (0.340), the number of errors in the complex reaction time test (-0.319), the ape      index (-0.319) and oxygen uptake during arm work at the anaerobic threshold      (0.254) were found to explain 77% of performance capacity common to the two      styles.FAU - Magiera, ArturAU  - Magiera AAD  - Academy of Physical Education, Department of Tourism and Sport Management,      Katowice, Poland.FAU - Roczniok, RobertAU  - Roczniok RFAU - Maszczyk, AdamAU  - Maszczyk AFAU - Czuba, MiloszAU  - Czuba MFAU - Kantyka, JoannaAU  - Kantyka JFAU - Kurek, PiotrAU  - Kurek PLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20130328PL  - PolandTA  - J Hum KinetJT  - Journal of human kineticsJID - 101513031PMC - PMC3661882OID - NLM: PMC3661882OTO - NOTNLMOT  - canonical analysisOT  - sport climbingOT  - structure of performanceEDAT- 2013/05/30 06:00MHDA- 2013/05/30 06:01CRDT- 2013/05/30 06:00PHST- 2013/03 [ppublish]PHST- 2013/03/28 [epublish]AID - 10.2478/hukin-2013-0011 [doi]AID - jhk-36-107 [pii]PST - epublishSO  - J Hum Kinet. 2013 Mar 28;36:107-17. doi: 10.2478/hukin-2013-0011.

Two central themes were      identified: (a) navigating two world views which referred to acculturation as a      fluid process where athletes navigated between cultural norms of the home      community and the host community, and (b) acculturation loads, which referred to       whether immigrants and those in the host country shared acculturation (i.e.,      acculturation as a two-way process) or managed the load with or without support      from others (i.e., acculturation as one-directional). Each of these central      themes comprised sub-themes, which provided further insight into the experiences       of acculturation for immigrant elite athletes. From the project, the authors      recommend further research utilising case studies to provide a holistic      description of the acculturation process from the vantage of various people      within the sport context.FAU - Schinke, Robert JoelAU  - Schinke RJAD  - a Laurentian University , School of Human Kinetics , B241 Ben Avery Building, 935      Ramsey Lake Road, Sudbury , Ontario , P3E2C6 Canada.FAU - McGannon, Kerry RAU  - McGannon KRFAU - Battochio, Randy CesarAU  - Battochio RCFAU - Wells, Greg DAU  - Wells GDLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20130520PL  - EnglandTA  - J Sports SciJT  - Journal of sports sciencesJID - 8405364SB  - IMMH  - *AcculturationMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - *AthletesMH  - CanadaMH  - *CultureMH  - *Emigrants and ImmigrantsMH  - *Emigration and ImmigrationMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Residence CharacteristicsMH  - *SportsMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2013/05/22 06:00MHDA- 2014/06/13 06:00CRDT- 2013/05/22 06:00PHST- 2013/05/20 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1080/02640414.2013.794949 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Sci. 2013;31(15):1676-86. doi: 10.1080/02640414.2013.794949.

However, vibration exercise has been trialled in other areas that are central to       athlete performance such as warm-up, flexibility and sprint speed. Therefore, the      aim of this review was to attempt to gain a better understanding of how acute and      short-term vibration exercise may impact on warm-up, flexibility and sprint      speed. The importance of warming up for sporting performance has been well      documented and vibration exercise has the capability to be included or used as a       standalone warm-up modality to increase intramuscular temperature at a faster      rate compared to other conventional warm-up modalities. However, vibration      exercise does not provide any additional neurogenic benefits compared to      conventional dynamic and passive warm-up interventions. Vibration exercise      appears to be a safe modality that does not produce any adverse affects causing      injury or harm and could be used during interval and substitution breaks, as it      would incur a low metabolic cost and be time-efficient compared to conventional      warm-up modalities. Acute or short-term vibration exercise can enhance      flexibility and range of motion without having a detrimental effect on muscle      power, however it is less clear which mechanisms may be responsible for this      enhancement. It appears that vibration exercise is not capable of improving      sprint speed performance; this could be due to the complex and dynamic nature of       sprinting where the purported increase in muscle power from vibration exercise is      probably lost on repeated actions of high force generation. Vibration exercise is      a safe modality that produces no adverse side effects for injury or harm. It has       the time-efficient capability of providing coaches, trainers, and exercise      specialists with an alternative modality that can be implemented for warm-up and       flexibility either in isolation or in conjunction with other conventional      training methods.FAU - Cochrane, DarrylAU  - Cochrane DAD  - School of Sport & Exercise, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand.      d.cochrane@massey.ac.nzLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20111108PL  - EnglandTA  - Eur J Sport SciJT  - European journal of sport scienceJID - 101146739SB  - IMMH  - Athletic Performance/*physiologyMH  - Body Temperature/physiologyMH  - *ExerciseMH  - HumansMH  - Muscle Stretching Exercises/*methodsMH  - Muscle, Skeletal/*physiologyMH  - Range of Motion, Articular/physiologyMH  - Running/*physiologyMH  - *VibrationEDAT- 2013/05/18 06:00MHDA- 2014/07/09 06:00CRDT- 2013/05/18 06:00PHST- 2011/11/08 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1080/17461391.2011.606837 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur J Sport Sci. 2013;13(3):256-71. doi: 10.1080/17461391.2011.606837.

METHODS: I used Westlaw and LexisNexis      databases to create a 50-state data set of youth sports TBI laws enacted between       January 2009 and December 2012. I collected and coded the text and citations of      each law and developed a protocol and codebook to facilitate future research.      RESULTS: Forty-four states and Washington, DC, passed youth sports TBI laws      between 2009 and 2012. No state's youth sports TBI law focuses on primary      prevention. Instead, such laws focus on (1) increasing coaches' and parents'      ability to identify and respond to TBIs and (2) reducing the immediate risk of      multiple TBIs. CONCLUSIONS: Existing youth sports TBI laws were not designed to      reduce initial TBIs. Evaluation is required to assess their effectiveness in      reducing the risk and consequences of multiple TBIs. Continued research and      evaluation of existing laws will be needed to develop a more comprehensive youth       TBI-reduction solution.FAU - Harvey, Hosea HAU  - Harvey HHAD  - Temple University, Beasley School of Law, Philadelphia, PA 19122, USA.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20130516PL  - United StatesTA  - Am J Public HealthJT  - American journal of public healthJID - 1254074SB  - AIMSB  - IMCIN - Am J Public Health. 2013 Dec;103(12):e1.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the       reasoning of elite combat-sport athletes about rapid weight loss and regaining of      weight before competitions. DESIGN: Qualitative study. SETTING: With grounded      theory as a theoretical framework, we employed a cross-examinational approach      including interviews, observations, and Internet sources. Sports observations      were obtained at competitions and statements by combat-sport athletes were      collected on the Internet. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Participants in the      interviews were 14 Swedish national team athletes (9 men, 5 women; age range, 18       to 36 years) in 3 Olympic combat sports (wrestling, judo, and taekwondo). DATA      COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Semistructured interviews with 14 athletes from the      Swedish national teams in wrestling, judo, and taekwondo were conducted at a      location of each participant's choice. The field observations were conducted at      European competitions in these 3 sports. In addition, interviews and statements      made by athletes in combat sports were collected on the Internet. RESULTS:      Positive aspects of weight regulation other than gaining physical advantage      emerged from the data during the analysis: sport identity, mental diversion, and       mental advantage. Together and individually, these categories point toward the      positive aspects of weight regulation experienced by the athletes. Practicing      weight regulation mediates a self-image of being "a real athlete." Weight      regulation is also considered mentally important as a part of the precompetition       preparation, serving as a coping strategy by creating a feeling of increased      focus and commitment. Moreover, a mental advantage relative to one's opponents      can be gained through the practice of weight regulation. CONCLUSIONS: Weight      regulation has mentally important functions extending beyond the common notion      that combat-sport athletes reduce their weight merely to gain a physical edge      over their opponents.FAU - Pettersson, StefanAU  - Pettersson SAD  - Department of Food and Nutrition, and Sport Science, University of Gothenburg,      Sweden. stefan.pettersson@ped.gu.seFAU - Ekstrom, Marianne PippingAU  - Ekstrom MPFAU - Berg, Christina MAU  - Berg CMLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Athl TrainJT  - Journal of athletic trainingJID - 9301647SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - *Athletic PerformanceMH  - Boxing/*physiology/*psychologyMH  - *Competitive BehaviorMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - InternetMH  - Interviews as TopicMH  - MaleMH  - Martial Arts/*physiology/*psychologyMH  - Qualitative ResearchMH  - SwedenMH  - *Weight LossMH  - Wrestling/*physiology/*psychologyPMC - PMC3554040OID - NLM: PMC3554040EDAT- 2013/05/16 06:00MHDA- 2013/11/01 06:00CRDT- 2013/05/16 06:00AID - 10.4085/1062-6050-48.1.04 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Athl Train. 2013 Jan-Feb;48(1):99-108. doi: 10.4085/1062-6050-48.1.04.PMID- 23668656OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20130514DCOM- 20131205IS  - 1558-299X (Electronic)IS  - 0095-4543 (Linking)VI  - 40IP  - 2DP  - 2013 JunTI  - The potential role of sports psychology in the obesity epidemic.PG  - 507-23LID - 10.1016/j.pop.2013.02.001 [doi]LID - S0095-4543(13)00016-X [pii]AB  - Sports psychologists play an important role in enhancing performance among      athletes. In conjunction with team physicians, they can also shed light on      psychological disorders common in athletes, such as mood and eating disorders,      and overtraining syndrome. Sports psychologists can also lend their expertise to       assist with injury prevention and recovery and compliance issues. Sports      psychology has a role in helping to reverse the growing obesity epidemic among      school-aged children. These professionals, working with coaches, can increase      children's levels of physical activity. Cognitive-behavioral techniques could      lead to enhanced enjoyment, increased participation, improved school performance,      and a reduction in obesity.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

This exploratory study examined stress responses in coaches      during competition, including psychological and physiological indices. Using      reversal theory, we examined metamotivational state profiles during competition.       Ten male team sport coaches (mean age 39.8 +/- 13.12 years) reported levels of      subjective stress, pleasant and unpleasant emotions, metamotivational state, and       provided saliva samples, on a competition day: 15 min prior to the pre-match team      talk; start of the match; end of the first half; start of the second half, and      end of the match, then at equivalent times on a noncompetition day. Saliva      samples were assayed for alpha-amylase activity. On competition day,      alpha-amylase activity was significantly higher, as were subjective stress,      arousal, and unpleasant emotions. Prior to and during active play, participants      were mainly in the conformist, alloic (other-oriented), and mastery states, and      at the end of the match, in the telic and sympathy states. Only 22      metamotivational state reversals were observed, mostly at the start and end of      the match. The elevated levels of subjective stress, alpha-amylase activity, and       unpleasant emotions suggest that educational programs may be useful for some      coaches to manage psychological states during competition.CI  - (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

A convenience sample of 63 SO (25 females and 38      males) and 59 TD (16 females and 43 males) athletes was retrieved through      communication with local club coaches. Three sub-groups of SO athletes were      identified based on disability, including non specified intellectual disability      (NSID=39), Down syndrome (DS=17), and Autism (Aut=7). Mean SO and TD athlete ages      were 20.35 (SD=7) and 18.8 (SD=8), respectively. For analysis purposes four age      groups were created (<15, 15-17, 18-20, >20 years). Participants completed the      13-item, two-factor Task and Ego Orientation in Sport Questionnaire (TEOSQ) and a      16-item four-factor abridged version of the Sport Motivation Scale (SMS). SO and       TD athletes were active in swimming (54 and 48, respectively) and basketball (9      and 11, respectively). Groups with and without ID were compared by means of      t-tests in the dichotomized variables gender and activity, as well as by 1-way      ANOVA with Tukey HSD post hoc comparisons across disability and age groups.      Gender distribution was the same in both groups. Participants with DS and NSID      scored significantly higher than TD athletes in most motivational scales.      Participants with ID increased their external motivation with increasing age,      while a reversed pattern was observed in TD. In summary, significant differences       between motivational patterns of SO athletes with ID and TD athletes can be      observed. These differences should be considered when developing training and      competition programs.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

On the basis of an entire National Basketball Association      season's worth of data, the research reported here shows that even a single      successful shot suffices to increase a player's likelihood of taking the next      team shot, increase the average distance from which this next shot is taken,      decrease the probability that this next shot is successful, and decrease the      probability that the coach will replace the player.FAU - Attali, YigalAU  - Attali YAD  - Educational Testing Service, Princeton, NJ 08541, USA. yattali@ets.orgLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20130429PL  - United StatesTA  - Psychol SciJT  - Psychological scienceJID - 9007542SB  - IMMH  - Athletes/*psychologyMH  - Athletic Performance/*psychologyMH  - Basketball/*psychologyMH  - *Decision MakingMH  - HumansMH  - JudgmentMH  - MaleMH  - *PerceptionMH  - *ProbabilityOTO - NOTNLMOT  - adaptive thinkingOT  - decision makingOT  - hot handOT  - judgmentOT  - sport psychologyOT  - streaksEDAT- 2013/05/01 06:00MHDA- 2014/03/14 06:00CRDT- 2013/05/01 06:00PHST- 2013/04/29 [aheadofprint]AID - 0956797612468452 [pii]AID - 10.1177/0956797612468452 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Psychol Sci. 2013 Jul 1;24(7):1151-6. doi: 10.1177/0956797612468452.

DESIGN:      Twenty-one past or present elite cricket fast bowlers and coaches of national or       international level were interviewed using an in-depth, open-ended,      semi-structured approach. METHODS: Participants were asked about specific factors      which they believed were markers of fast bowling expertise potential. Of specific      interest was the relative importance of each potential component of fast bowling       expertise and how components interacted or developed over time. RESULTS: The      importance of intrinsic motivation early in development was highlighted, along      with physical, psychological and technical attributes. Results supported a      multiplicative and interactive complex systems model of talent development in      fast bowling, in which component weightings were varied due to individual      differences in potential experts. Dropout rates in potential experts were      attributed to misconceived current talent identification programmes and coaching       practices, early maturation and physical attributes, injuries and lack of key      psychological attributes and skills. CONCLUSIONS: Data are consistent with a      dynamical systems model of expertise acquisition in fast bowling, with numerous      trajectories available for talent development. Further work is needed to relate      experiential and theoretical knowledge on expertise in other sports.CI  - Copyright (c) 2013 Sports Medicine Australia. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AIM: This study aims to      investigate whether previous AAS-use affects mental health, present      sociodemographic data, sport activity and substance abuse in a retrospective      30-year follow-up study of former elite athletes. METHODS: Swedish male-elite      power sport athletes (n=683) on the top 10 national ranking lists during any of      the years 1960-1979 in wrestling, Olympic lifting, powerlifting and the throwing       events in track and field answered a questionnaire. RESULTS: At least 20% of the       former athletes admitted previous AAS-use. They had more often sought      professional expertise for mental problems and had used illicit drugs compared to      those not having used AAS. The AAS-users also differed in former sport activity      pattern compared to non AAS-users. CONCLUSIONS: It is clear that a relationship      exists between use of AAS and mental-health problems. Further studies need to be       done in order to clarify this relationship.FAU - Lindqvist, A SAU  - Lindqvist ASAD  - Centre for Ethics, Law and Mental Health, University of Gothenburg and the      Forensic Psychiatric Clinic, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, , Gothenburg,      Sweden.FAU - Moberg, TAU  - Moberg TFAU - Eriksson, B OAU  - Eriksson BOFAU - Ehrnborg, CAU  - Ehrnborg CFAU - Rosen, TAU  - Rosen TFAU - Fahlke, CAU  - Fahlke CLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20130423PL  - EnglandTA  - Br J Sports MedJT  - British journal of sports medicineJID - 0432520RN  - 0 (Anabolic Agents)SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Aged, 80 and overMH  - Anabolic Agents/*adverse effectsMH  - Doping in Sports/*psychologyMH  - Follow-Up StudiesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Mental Disorders/*epidemiologyMH  - Mental HealthMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Patient Acceptance of Health Care/statistics & numerical dataMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Sports/*psychology/statistics & numerical dataMH  - Substance-Related Disorders/*epidemiology/psychologyMH  - Sweden/epidemiologyOTO - NOTNLMOT  - Anabolic steroidsOT  - AthleticsOT  - DopingOT  - Drug useOT  - PsychologyEDAT- 2013/04/25 06:00MHDA- 2014/04/10 06:00CRDT- 2013/04/25 06:00PHST- 2013/04/23 [aheadofprint]AID - bjsports-2012-091340 [pii]AID - 10.1136/bjsports-2012-091340 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Br J Sports Med. 2013 Oct;47(15):965-9. doi: 10.1136/bjsports-2012-091340.

One possible explanation is that coaches select players based on      physical attributes, which are more likely witnessed in relatively older      athletes. PURPOSE: To determine if coach selections are responsible for RAEs by      comparing RAEs in male players who played competitive versus noncompetitive ice      hockey. METHODS: Using chi-square, we analyzed the birth dates of 147,991 male      ice hockey players who were 5 to 17 years old. Players' birth dates were divided       into four quartiles, beginning with January to March, which coincides with Hockey      Canada's selection year. RESULTS: There were strong RAEs (p < .001) when players       were selected to competitive teams by coaches through a tryout system. On      noncompetitive teams that did not have coach selections, there were strong RAEs      (p < .001) from 5 to 8 years old, but not 9 to 17 years old. CONCLUSIONS:      Although coaches might perpetuate RAEs, other influential social agents might      include parents, which ought to be investigated in future research.FAU - Hancock, David JAU  - Hancock DJAD  - University of Ottawa. hancockd@queensu.caFAU - Ste-Marie, Diane MAU  - Ste-Marie DMFAU - Young, Bradley WAU  - Young BWLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Res Q Exerc SportJT  - Research quarterly for exercise and sportJID - 8006373SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Age FactorsMH  - Athletic Performance/*physiologyMH  - Chi-Square DistributionMH  - ChildMH  - Child, PreschoolMH  - Hockey/*physiology/statistics & numerical dataMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - OntarioMH  - *Physical Education and TrainingEDAT- 2013/04/25 06:00MHDA- 2013/07/16 06:00CRDT- 2013/04/25 06:00AID - 10.1080/02701367.2013.762325 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Res Q Exerc Sport. 2013 Mar;84(1):126-30.PMID- 23584762OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20130513DCOM- 20131226LR  - 20141116IS  - 1473-0480 (Electronic)IS  - 0306-3674 (Linking)VI  - 47IP  - 9DP  - 2013 JunTI  - Sports and exercise-related tendinopathies: a review of selected topical issues      by participants of the second International Scientific Tendinopathy Symposium      (ISTS) Vancouver 2012.PG  - 536-44LID - 10.1136/bjsports-2013-092329 [doi]AB  - In September 2010, the first International Scientific Tendinopathy Symposium      (ISTS) was held in Umea, Sweden, to establish a forum for original scientific and      clinical insights in this growing field of clinical research and practice. The      second ISTS was organised by the same group and held in Vancouver, Canada, in      September 2012. This symposium was preceded by a round-table meeting in which the      participants engaged in focused discussions, resulting in the following overview       of tendinopathy clinical and research issues. This paper is a narrative review      and summary developed during and after the second ISTS. The document is designed       to highlight some key issues raised at ISTS 2012, and to integrate them into a      shared conceptual framework. It should be considered an update and a signposting       document rather than a comprehensive review. The document is developed for use by      physiotherapists, physicians, athletic trainers, massage therapists and other      health professionals as well as team coaches and strength/conditioning managers      involved in care of sportspeople or workers with tendinopathy.FAU - Scott, AlexAU  - Scott AAD  - Department of Physical Therapy, University of British Columbia, Vancouver,      British Columbia, Canada. ascott@interchange.ubc.caFAU - Docking, SeanAU  - Docking SFAU - Vicenzino, BillAU  - Vicenzino BFAU - Alfredson, HakanAU  - Alfredson HFAU - Murphy, Richard JAU  - Murphy RJFAU - Carr, Andrew JAU  - Carr AJFAU - Zwerver, JohannesAU  - Zwerver JFAU - Lundgreen, KirstenAU  - Lundgreen KFAU - Finlay, OliverAU  - Finlay OFAU - Pollock, NoelAU  - Pollock NFAU - Cook, Jill LAU  - Cook JLFAU - Fearon, AngelaAU  - Fearon AFAU - Purdam, Craig RAU  - Purdam CRFAU - Hoens, AlisonAU  - Hoens AFAU - Rees, Jonathan DAU  - Rees JDFAU - Goetz, Thomas JAU  - Goetz TJFAU - Danielson, PatrikAU  - Danielson PLA  - engGR  - 117690-1/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/CanadaGR  - MCO-117690/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/CanadaPT  - Consensus Development ConferencePT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20130412PL  - EnglandTA  - Br J Sports MedJT  - British journal of sports medicineJID - 0432520SB  - IMEIN - Br J Sports Med. 2013 Aug;47(12):774.

However, up until the development of       the Weight Pressures in Sport for Females (WPS-F; Reel, SooHoo, Petrie,      Greenleaf, & Carter, 2010) there was no way to quantify sport-specific weight      pressures with female athletes. In this study, the psychometric properties of the      scale were further examined using a sample of 414 female collegiate athletes.      Sample 1 [n=207; M=19.27 years; SD=1.16] and Sample 2 [n=207; M=19.19 years;      SD=1.66] participants were of a similar age and were used for exploratory and      confirmatory analyses respectively. A two factor structure was confirmed and it      was established that the scale was unique from general sociocultural pressures      that all women experience, predicting female athletes' internalization, body      dissatisfaction, dietary intent, and bulimic symptomatology. Specifically, the      following factors, Coach and Sport Pressures about Weight (Factor 1) and      Pressures Regarding Appearance and Performance (Factor 2), were found to have      strong internal consistency and the emerging reliable and valid WPS-F has      practical implications for screening and identifying weight-related sport      pressures within female athletes. WPS-F can also serve to educate sport      professionals about environmental pressures so that disordered eating and body      image disturbances can be prevented.CI  - Published by Elsevier Ltd.FAU - Reel, Justine JAU  - Reel JJAD  - Department of Health Promotion and Education, University of Utah, Salt Lake City,      UT 84112, USA.

The objective of this study was to determine the mechanisms of      brain injuries among children and youth participating in team sports. METHODS: We      conducted a retrospective case series of brain injuries suffered by children      participating in team sports. The Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and      Prevention Program (CHIRPP) database was searched for brain injury cases among      5-19 year-olds playing ice hockey, soccer, American football (football),      basketball, baseball, or rugby between 1990 and 2009. Mechanisms of injury were      classified as "struck by player," "struck by object," "struck by sport      implement," "struck surface," and "other." A descriptive analysis was performed.       RESULTS: There were 12,799 brain injuries related to six team sports (16.2% of      all brain injuries registered in CHIRPP). Males represented 81% of injuries and      the mean age was 13.2 years. Ice hockey accounted for the greatest number of      brain injuries (44.3%), followed by soccer (19.0%) and football (12.9%). In ice      hockey, rugby, and basketball, striking another player was the most common injury      mechanism. Football, basketball, and soccer also demonstrated high proportions of      injuries due to contact with an object (e.g., post) among younger players. In      baseball, a common mechanism in the 5-9 year-old group was being hit with a bat      as a result of standing too close to the batter (26.1% males, 28.3% females).      INTERPRETATION: Many sports-related brain injury mechanisms are preventable. The       results suggest that further efforts aimed at universal rule changes, safer      playing environments, and the education of coaches, players, and parents should      be targeted in maximizing prevention of sport-related brain injury using a      multifaceted approach.FAU - Cusimano, Michael DAU  - Cusimano MDAD  - Injury Prevention Research Office, St. Michael's Hospital, University of Toronto,      Toronto, Canada. cusimanom@smh.caFAU - Cho, NewtonAU  - Cho NFAU - Amin, KhizerAU  - Amin KFAU - Shirazi, MariamAU  - Shirazi MFAU - McFaull, Steven RAU  - McFaull SRFAU - Do, Minh TAU  - Do MTFAU - Wong, Matthew CAU  - Wong MCFAU - Russell, KellyAU  - Russell KLA  - engGR  - TIR-103946/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/CanadaPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20130328PL  - United StatesTA  - PLoS OneJT  - PloS oneJID - 101285081SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Age FactorsMH  - Athletic Injuries/*epidemiology/prevention & controlMH  - Brain Injuries/*epidemiology/*etiology/prevention & controlMH  - CanadaMH  - ChildMH  - Child, PreschoolMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - IncidenceMH  - MaleMH  - SportsMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Young AdultPMC - PMC3610710OID - NLM: PMC3610710EDAT- 2013/04/05 06:00MHDA- 2013/10/18 06:00CRDT- 2013/04/05 06:00PHST- 2012/06/26 [received]PHST- 2013/02/11 [accepted]PHST- 2013/03/28 [epublish]AID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0058868 [doi]AID - PONE-D-12-19013 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - PLoS One. 2013;8(3):e58868. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0058868.

METHODS: A nine level Hip Sports      Activity Scale (HSAS) was constructed both in German and English languages.      Fifty-nine consecutive patients undergoing surgical treatment for FAI at two      centers in Switzerland and in the US completed a questionnaire set consisting of       the HSAS, the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) activity scale and      different hip joint-specific and generic outcome tools. For reliability      assessment, the HSAS was completed twice about nine days apart. Evidence of      reliability, validity and responsiveness was investigated by classical      psychometric analyses. RESULTS: Reliability was excellent for both the German and      the English versions with intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.94 and 0.96,      respectively. Evidence of convergent validity was supported by moderate to high      correlations with the UCLA activity scale and with the joint-specific measures      used. Evidence of divergent validity was supported by low correlations with the      SF-12 Mental Component Scale and the WOMAC stiffness subscale. The standardised      response mean was 0.69. CONCLUSIONS: The HSAS is a reliable and valid tool to      determine sports levels in patients suffering from FAI. Its use in future studies      investigating outcomes in young patients with hip disease can be recommended.

In study 1, an expert and usability panel examined the content validity      and applicability of an initial item pool. The resultant 96 items were analyzed      with exploratory factor analyses in Study 2, with the factorial structure      comprising 5 factors (viz., goals and development, logistics and operations, team      and culture, coaching, selection) and 33 items. Using confirmatory factor      analyses, Studies 3 and 4 found support for the 5-factor structure. Study 4 also       provided evidence for the OSI-SP's concurrent validity and invariance across      different groups.

This phenomenon has evolved greatly in      recent years, and greater understanding of it is essential for developing      efficient prevention programmes. In the psychosocial approach, attitudes are      considered an index of doping behaviour, relating the use of banned substances to      greater leniency towards doping. The aim of this review is to gather and      critically analyse the most recent publications describing elite athletes'      attitudes, beliefs and knowledge of doping in sport, to better understand the      foundations provided by the previous work, and to help develop practical      strategies to efficiently combat doping. For this purpose, we performed a      literature search using combinations of the terms "doping", "sport", "elite      athletes", "attitudes", "beliefs", "knowledge", "drugs", and      "performance-enhancing substances" (PES). A total of 33 studies were subjected to      comprehensive assessment using articles published between 2000 and 2011. All of      the reports focused on elite athletes and described their attitudes, beliefs and       knowledge of doping in sport. The initial reasons given for using banned      substances included achievement of athletic success by improving performance,      financial gain, improving recovery and prevention of nutritional deficiencies, as      well as the idea that others use them, or the "false consensus effect". Although       most athletes acknowledge that doping is cheating, unhealthy and risky because of      sanctions, its effectiveness is also widely recognized. There is a general belief      about the inefficacy of anti-doping programmes, and athletes criticise the way      tests are carried out. Most athletes consider the severity of punishment is      appropriate or not severe enough. There are some differences between sports, as      team-based sports and sports requiring motor skills could be less influenced by      doping practices than individual self-paced sports. However, anti-doping controls      are less exhaustive in team sports. The use of banned substance also differs      according to the demand of the specific sport. Coaches appear to be the main      influence and source of information for athletes, whereas doctors and other      specialists do not seem to act as principal advisors. Athletes are becoming      increasingly familiar with anti-doping rules, but there is still a lack of      knowledge that should be remedied using appropriate educational programmes. There      is also a lack of information on dietary supplements and the side effects of PES.      Therefore, information and prevention are necessary, and should cater to the      athletes and associated stakeholders. This will allow us to establish and      maintain correct attitudes towards doping. Psychosocial programmes must be      carefully planned and developed, and should include middle- to long-term      objectives (e.g. changing attitudes towards doping and the doping culture). Some       institutions have developed or started prevention or educational programmes      without the necessary resources, while the majority of the budget is spent on      anti-doping testing. Controls are obviously needed, as well as more efficient      educational strategies. Therefore, we encourage sporting institutions to invest      in educational programmes aimed at discouraging the use of banned substances.      Event organizers and sport federations should work together to adapt the rules of      each competition to disincentivize dopers. Current research methods are weak,      especially questionnaires. A combination of qualitative and quantitative      measurements are recommended, using interviews, questionnaires and, ideally,      biomedical tests. Studies should also examine possible geographical and cultural       differences in attitudes towards doping.FAU - Morente-Sanchez, JaimeAU  - Morente-Sanchez JAD  - Department of Physical Education and Sport, Faculty of Sport Sciences, University      of Granada, c/ Carretera Alfacar s/n, 18011, Granada, Spain.FAU - Zabala, MikelAU  - Zabala MLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPT  - ReviewPL  - New ZealandTA  - Sports MedJT  - Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)JID - 8412297SB  - IMMH  - Athletes/*psychologyMH  - *CultureMH  - Doping in Sports/*psychology/statistics & numerical dataMH  - *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, PracticeMH  - HumansEDAT- 2013/03/28 06:00MHDA- 2014/01/17 06:00CRDT- 2013/03/28 06:00AID - 10.1007/s40279-013-0037-x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Sports Med. 2013 Jun;43(6):395-411. doi: 10.1007/s40279-013-0037-x.PMID- 23519923OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20130322DCOM- 20130912IS  - 1439-1236 (Electronic)IS  - 0932-0555 (Linking)VI  - 27IP  - 1DP  - 2013 MarTI  - [Mental illness -- Sports psychiatric consultation on UKJ for professional      athletes].PG  - 6-8LID - 10.1055/s-0033-1341566 [doi]LA  - gerPT  - Journal ArticleTT  - Psychische Erkrankungen - Sportpsychiatrische Sprechstunde am UKJ fur      Profisportler.DEP - 20130321PL  - GermanyTA  - Sportverletz SportschadenJT  - Sportverletzung Sportschaden : Organ der Gesellschaft fur      Orthopadisch-Traumatologische SportmedizinJID - 8904133SB  - IMMH  - Athletic Injuries/*complications/psychology/*rehabilitationMH  - GermanyMH  - HumansMH  - Mental Disorders/*etiology/psychology/*rehabilitationMH  - Referral and Consultation/*trendsMH  - Sports Medicine/*trendsMH  - Student Health ServicesEDAT- 2013/03/23 06:00MHDA- 2013/09/13 06:00CRDT- 2013/03/23 06:00PHST- 2013/03/21 [epublish]AID - 10.1055/s-0033-1341566 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Sportverletz Sportschaden. 2013 Mar;27(1):6-8. doi: 10.1055/s-0033-1341566.

In this study we considered      perceptual-cognitive skill across groups of high and low-skilled soccer players      and soccer coaches. A range of perceptual-cognitive variables was measured in an       attempt to capture the diverse skills related to expertise in sport and coaching.

The potential of      professional sports club settings to engage men in health promotion activities is      being increasingly recognised. This paper describes the development and      optimization of the Football Fans in Training (FFIT) programme, which aims to      help overweight men (many of them football supporters) lose weight through      becoming more active and adopting healthier eating habits. METHODS: The MRC      Framework for the design and evaluation of complex interventions was used to      guide programme development in two phases. In Phase 1, a multidisciplinary      working group developed the pilot programme (p-FFIT) and used a scoping review to      summarize previous research and identify the target population. Phase 2 involved       a process evaluation of p-FFIT in 11 Scottish Premier League (SPL) clubs.      Participant and coach feedback, focus group discussions and interviews explored      the utility/acceptability of programme components and suggestions for changes.      Programme session observations identified examples of good practice and      problems/issues with delivery. Together, these findings informed redevelopment of      the optimized programme (FFIT), whose components were mapped onto specific      behaviour change techniques using an evidence-based taxonomy. RESULTS: p-FFIT      comprised 12, weekly, gender-sensitised, group-based weight management classroom       and 'pitch-side' physical activity sessions. These in-stadia sessions were      complemented by an incremental, pedometer-based walking programme. p-FFIT was      targeted at men aged 35-65 years with body mass index >/= 27 kg/m(2). Phase 2      demonstrated that participants in p-FFIT were enthusiastic about both the      classroom and physical activity components, and valued the camaraderie and      peer-support offered by the programme. Coaches appreciated the simplicity of the       key healthy eating and physical activity messages. Suggestions for improvements      that were incorporated into the optimized FFIT programme included: more varied      in-stadia physical activity with football-related components; post-programme      weight management support (emails and a reunion session); and additional training      for coaches in SMART goal setting and the pedometer-based walking programme.      CONCLUSIONS: The Football Fans in Training programme is highly acceptable to      participants and SPL coaches, and is appropriate for evaluation in a randomised      controlled trial.FAU - Gray, Cindy MAU  - Gray CMAD  - Institute of Health and Wellbeing, 27 Bute Gardens, University of Glasgow,      Glasgow G12 8RS, UK. cindy.gray@glasgow.ac.ukFAU - Hunt, KateAU  - Hunt KFAU - Mutrie, NanetteAU  - Mutrie NFAU - Anderson, Annie SAU  - Anderson ASFAU - Leishman, JimAU  - Leishman JFAU - Dalgarno, LindsayAU  - Dalgarno LFAU - Wyke, SallyAU  - Wyke SLA  - engGR  - 09/3010/06/Department of Health/United KingdomGR  - CZG/2/504/Chief Scientist Office/United KingdomGR  - MC_U130059811/Medical Research Council/United KingdomPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20130316PL  - EnglandTA  - BMC Public HealthJT  - BMC public healthJID - 100968562SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Food Habits/*psychologyMH  - FootballMH  - Health Promotion/*methodsMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - *Motor ActivityMH  - Overweight/*prevention & controlMH  - Program DevelopmentMH  - Program EvaluationMH  - Public FacilitiesMH  - *Weight Reduction ProgramsPMC - PMC3621078OID - NLM: PMC3621078EDAT- 2013/03/19 06:00MHDA- 2013/06/26 06:00CRDT- 2013/03/19 06:00PHST- 2012/09/05 [received]PHST- 2013/03/05 [accepted]PHST- 2013/03/16 [aheadofprint]AID - 1471-2458-13-232 [pii]AID - 10.1186/1471-2458-13-232 [doi]PST - epublishSO  - BMC Public Health. 2013 Mar 16;13:232. doi: 10.1186/1471-2458-13-232.PMID- 23482922OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20140324DCOM- 20141211IS  - 1473-0480 (Electronic)IS  - 0306-3674 (Linking)VI  - 48IP  - 8DP  - 2014 AprTI  - The reach and adoption of a coach-led exercise training programme in community      football.PG  - 718-23LID - 10.1136/bjsports-2012-091797 [doi]AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the reach and adoption of a coach-led exercise training      programme for lower limb injury prevention. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of data      from a group-clustered randomised controlled trial. SETTING: A periodised      exercise training warm-up programme was delivered to players during training      sessions over an 8-week preseason (weeks 1-8) and 18-week playing season.      PARTICIPANTS: 1564 community Australian football players. MAIN OUTCOME      MEASUREMENTS: Reach, measured weekly, was the number of players who attended      training sessions. Adoption was the number of attending players who completed the      programme in full, partially or not at all. Reasons for partial or      non-participation were recorded. RESULTS: In week 1, 599 players entered the      programme; 55% attended 1 training session and 45% attended > 1 session. By week       12, 1540 players were recruited but training attendance (reach) decreased to      <50%. When players attended training, the majority adopted the full      programme-ranging from 96% (week 1) to above 80% until week 20. The most common      reasons for low adoption were players being injured, too sore, being late for      training or choosing their own warm-up. CONCLUSIONS: The training programme's      reach was highest preseason and halved at the playing season's end. However, when      players attended training sessions, their adoption was high and remained close to      70% by season end. For sports injury prevention programmes to be fully effective       across a season, attention also needs to be given to (1) encouraging players to      attend formal training sessions and (2) considering the possibility of some form       of programme delivery outside of formal training.FAU - Finch, Caroline FAU  - Finch CFAD  - Australian Centre for Research into Sports Injury and its Prevention (ACRISP),      Monash Injury Research Institute (MIRI), Monash University, , Melbourne,      Victoria, Australia.FAU - Diamantopoulou, KathyAU  - Diamantopoulou KFAU - Twomey, Dara MAU  - Twomey DMFAU - Doyle, Tim L AAU  - Doyle TLFAU - Lloyd, David GAU  - Lloyd DGFAU - Young, WarrenAU  - Young WFAU - Elliott, Bruce CAU  - Elliott BCLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Randomized Controlled TrialPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20130312PL  - EnglandTA  - Br J Sports MedJT  - British journal of sports medicineJID - 0432520SB  - IMMH  - Athletic Injuries/prevention & controlMH  - Attitude to HealthMH  - Cluster AnalysisMH  - Exercise Therapy/*methodsMH  - Football/*injuriesMH  - HumansMH  - Professional PracticeMH  - VictoriaMH  - Western AustraliaPMC - PMC3995237OID - NLM: PMC3995237OTO - NOTNLMOT  - ImplementationOT  - Injury PreventionEDAT- 2013/03/14 06:00MHDA- 2014/12/17 06:00CRDT- 2013/03/14 06:00PHST- 2013/03/12 [aheadofprint]AID - bjsports-2012-091797 [pii]AID - 10.1136/bjsports-2012-091797 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Br J Sports Med. 2014 Apr;48(8):718-23. doi: 10.1136/bjsports-2012-091797.

This study investigates the relationship      between adolescents' sports clubs participation and self-reported mental and      physical conditions and future expectations. The participants were 10,987 pupils       in the final three years of their compulsory education in Iceland (aged 14-16      years). The participants completed questionnaires administered to students in the      classroom relating to health and behaviour. The results indicate that      participation in sports clubs influences adolescents positively; adolescents who       work hard at sport not only believe they are in better mental and physical      condition, they also believe they can succeed in other areas such as their      studies.

Coaches' and athletes' perceptions of      important positive and negative factors affecting performance were compared.      Participants were 48 high-level international triathletes (n = 34) and their      coaches (n = 14). They were personally interviewed via a questionnaire designed      by four accredited experts, who selected groups of both positive and negative      factors affecting performance. A list of factors was developed, in order of      greater to lesser importance in the opinion of athletes and coaches, for      subsequent analysis. Two ranked lists (positive and negative factors) indicated      that athletes appear to rate personal environment factors (family, teammates,      lack of support from relatives) higher, while the coaches tended to give more      importance to technical and institutional aspects (institutional support, coach,       medical support). There was complete agreement between coaches and triathletes      about the top five positive factors. Negative factor agreement was somewhat lower      (agreement on 3/5 factors). The most important positive factor for coaches and      athletes was "dedication/engagement," while the most important factor adversely      affecting performance was "injuries".FAU - Ruiz-Tendero, GermanAU  - Ruiz-Tendero GAD  - Complutense University of Madrid. german.ruiz@edu.ucm.esFAU - Salinero Martin, Juan JoseAU  - Salinero Martin JJLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Percept Mot SkillsJT  - Perceptual and motor skillsJID - 0401131SB  - IMMH  - *AchievementMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - Athletes/*psychologyMH  - AttitudeMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - *PerceptionMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Sports/*psychologyEDAT- 2013/02/16 06:00MHDA- 2013/03/08 06:00CRDT- 2013/02/16 06:00AID - 10.2466/08.25.PMS.115.6.865-880 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Percept Mot Skills. 2012 Dec;115(3):865-80.PMID- 23404877OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20130213DCOM- 20130820IS  - 1543-2904 (Electronic)IS  - 0895-2779 (Linking)VI  - 35IP  - 1DP  - 2013 FebTI  - A conditional process model of children's behavioral engagement and behavioral      disaffection in sport based on self-determination theory.PG  - 30-43AB  - The potential benefits of children's engagement in sport for their psychological,      social, and physical health are well established. Yet children may also      experience psychological and social impairments due, in part, to a variety of      detrimental coach behaviors. In the current study, we proposed and tested a      conditional process model of children's self-reported behavioral engagement and      behavioral disaffection in sport based on self-determination theory. Results from      a sample of 245 youth soccer players suggested that structure from coaches      related positively to behavioral engagement and negatively to behavioral      disaffection, and that these relations were mediated by athletes' basic      psychological need satisfaction. Importantly, and in line with our hypotheses,      these indirect effects were moderated by autonomy support from coaches, such that      the mediation was evident only among those who reported higher levels of autonomy      support. These findings underscore the importance of coaches' providing guidance,      expectations, and feedback (i.e., structure) in a way that respects athletes'      volition (i.e., autonomy support).FAU - Curran, ThomasAU  - Curran TAD  - Institute of Sport, Exercise and Active Living, Victoria University, Melbourne,      Australia.FAU - Hill, Andrew PAU  - Hill APFAU - Niemiec, Christopher PAU  - Niemiec CPLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Sport Exerc PsycholJT  - Journal of sport & exercise psychologyJID - 8809258SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - ChildMH  - Child Behavior/*psychologyMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Models, PsychologicalMH  - *Personal AutonomyMH  - Personal SatisfactionMH  - Psychological TestsMH  - Soccer/psychologyMH  - Sports/*psychologyEDAT- 2013/02/14 06:00MHDA- 2013/08/21 06:00CRDT- 2013/02/14 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Sport Exerc Psychol. 2013 Feb;35(1):30-43.PMID- 23402372OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20130514DCOM- 20131223IS  - 1466-447X (Electronic)IS  - 0264-0414 (Linking)VI  - 31IP  - 10DP  - 2013TI  - Personal and situational factors influencing coaches' perceptions of stress.PG  - 1054-63LID - 10.1080/02640414.2012.759659 [doi]AB  - Coaching has been recognised as a demanding occupation, associated with a range      of stressors. The extent to which coaches perceive stress is likely to be      influenced by various personal and situational factors. The purpose of this study      was to identify coaches' levels of perceived stress and examine the personal and       situational factors that may influence coaches' perceptions of stress. In total,       502 coaches working with university, college, Canada Games, and/or nationally      identified athletes completed this study. Coaches completed an online survey,      which included questions regarding demographics, work/job-related considerations,      and aspects relating to their contract. Coaches also completed the Perceived      Stress Scale (Cohen, Kamarck, & Mermelstein, 1983). Overall coaches indicated      slightly below average levels of perceived stress (M = 15.13 out of 40) compared       with norm-values (Cohen & Janicki-Deverts, 2012). Demographic factors,      job-related characteristics, and certain aspects of their contract were      associated with coaches' perceptions of stress. In particular, unclear      expectations, long-working hours (>40), lack of agreed evaluation criteria,      higher salaries, and a lack of social support were related to higher perceptions       of stress. As such, the findings of the current study indicate that a reduction      in perceived stress is likely to be achieved through a multifaceted approach that      addresses multiple factors associated with coaching.FAU - Knight, Camilla JAU  - Knight CJAD  - University of Alberta, Faculty of Physical Education and Recreation, W1-34 Van      Vliet, Edmonton, Alberta, T6G2H9, Canada. cjknight@ualberta.caFAU - Reade, Ian LAU  - Reade ILFAU - Selzler, Anne-MarieAU  - Selzler AMFAU - Rodgers, Wendy MAU  - Rodgers WMLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20130213PL  - EnglandTA  - J Sports SciJT  - Journal of sports sciencesJID - 8405364SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - CanadaMH  - *ContractsMH  - Employment/*psychologyMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - *Job SatisfactionMH  - MaleMH  - *PerceptionMH  - Reference ValuesMH  - Salaries and Fringe BenefitsMH  - Social SupportMH  - Sports/*psychologyMH  - *Stress, PsychologicalMH  - Workload/psychologyEDAT- 2013/02/14 06:00MHDA- 2013/12/24 06:00CRDT- 2013/02/14 06:00PHST- 2013/02/13 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1080/02640414.2012.759659 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Sci. 2013;31(10):1054-63. doi: 10.1080/02640414.2012.759659.

This study      investigated the extent to which health and functional ability predict adult      survivors' body image (BI) and self-confidence regarding sports and physical      activity. The study cohort covered 708 eligible >/= 18 year old CNS tumor      survivors, and data from 528 (75 %) were analyzed. Disability was estimated using      the Health Utilities Index Mark2/3, a multidimensional self-report instrument.      Physical self-confidence in terms of BI and sports/physical activity-related      self-confidence (SPAS) were assessed using the BI and the Sports/Athletics      modules of a standardized self-report assessment scale. In adjusted regression      models, global health and functional status (GHFS) predicted BI (B = 0.94, 95 %      CI 0.69-1.19) and SPAS (B = 0.79, 95 % CI 0.55-1.04). Emotion and pain, and to a       lesser degree cognition, speech and vision disability, were associated with      poorer BI and SPAS. Gender, sub-diagnosis, and time since diagnosis influenced      the relationship between health status and physical self-confidence outcomes.      Females had poorer GHFS, BI and SPAS than males. Decreased health and functional       ability following childhood CNS cancer intrudes on physical self-confidence, with      females being at heightened risk for both disability and negative      self-confidence. Identified disability and gender-related risk calls for a      follow-up plan that integrates treatment of psychological sequelae in lifetime      monitoring of childhood CNS tumor survivors to restore and protect self-image and      self-confidence, essential mental health correlates. An expanded plan should      recognize the need for such services, optimizing life-long quality of survival      for CNS tumor survivors.FAU - Boman, Krister KAU  - Boman KKAD  - Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Department of Women's and Children's Health,      Karolinska Institutet, Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, Q6:05, 17176      Stockholm, Sweden. krister.boman@ki.seFAU - Hornquist, LinaAU  - Hornquist LFAU - De Graaff, LisanneAU  - De Graaff LFAU - Rickardsson, JennyAU  - Rickardsson JFAU - Lannering, BirgittaAU  - Lannering BFAU - Gustafsson, GoranAU  - Gustafsson GLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20130126PL  - United StatesTA  - J NeurooncolJT  - Journal of neuro-oncologyJID - 8309335SB  - IMMH  - Activities of Daily LivingMH  - AdultMH  - *Body ImageMH  - *Central Nervous System Neoplasms/complications/epidemiology/psychologyMH  - Cohort StudiesMH  - Community Health PlanningMH  - *Disabled PersonsMH  - FemaleMH  - *Health StatusMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Motor Activity/*physiologyMH  - Regression AnalysisMH  - *Self ConceptMH  - SportsMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2013/01/29 06:00MHDA- 2013/09/06 06:00CRDT- 2013/01/29 06:00PHST- 2012/07/30 [received]PHST- 2012/12/29 [accepted]PHST- 2013/01/26 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1007/s11060-012-1039-5 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Neurooncol. 2013 Mar;112(1):99-106. doi: 10.1007/s11060-012-1039-5.

However, the extent to which the      coaches undertake this role will depend upon their attitudes about injury      prevention, their perceptions of what the other coaches usually do and their own       beliefs about how much control they have in delivering such programmes. Fifty-one      junior netball coaches were surveyed about incorporating the teaching of correct       (safe) landing technique during their delivery of training sessions to junior      players. Overall, >94% of coaches had strongly positive attitudes towards      teaching correct landing technique and >80% had strongly positive perceptions of       their own control over delivering such programmes. Coaches' ratings of social      norms relating to what others think about teaching safe landing were more      positive (>94%) than those relating to what others actually do (63-74%). In      conclusion, the junior coaches were generally receptive towards delivering safe      landing training programmes in the training sessions they led.

Exposure rates alone do not account for the increase in injuries.      Societal pressures to perform at high levels affect both coaches and athletes and      lead to inappropriate levels of training intensity, frequency, and duration. In      this environment high physiologic stresses are applied to the immature skeleton      of the youth athlete causing injury. Typically, since bone is the weakest link in      the incomplete ossified skeleton, the majority of traumatic injuries result in      fractures that occur both at mid-shaft and at the growth centers of bone. The      following clinical commentary describes the common traumatic sports injuries that      occur in youth athletes, as well as those which require rapid identification and       care in order to prevent long term sequelae.FAU - Merkel, Donna LAU  - Merkel DLAD  - Bryn Mawr Rehab Hospital, Main Line Health System, Exton, PA, USA.FAU - Molony, Joseph T JrAU  - Molony JT JrLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Int J Sports Phys TherJT  - International journal of sports physical therapyJID - 101553140PMC - PMC3537461OID - NLM: PMC3537461OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Emergency careOT  - immature skeletonOT  - traumatic injuriesOT  - youth sports injuriesEDAT- 2013/01/15 06:00MHDA- 2013/01/15 06:01CRDT- 2013/01/15 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Int J Sports Phys Ther. 2012 Dec;7(6):691-704.PMID- 23315754OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20130114DCOM- 20130619LR  - 20131121IS  - 1179-2035 (Electronic)IS  - 0112-1642 (Linking)VI  - 43IP  - 1DP  - 2013 JanTI  - The ergonomics of wheelchair configuration for optimal performance in the      wheelchair court sports.PG  - 23-38LID - 10.1007/s40279-012-0005-x [doi]AB  - Optimizing mobility performance in wheelchair court sports (basketball, rugby and      tennis) is dependent on a combination of factors associated with the user, the      wheelchair and the interfacing between the two. Substantial research has been      attributed to the wheelchair athlete yet very little has focused on the role of      the wheelchair and the wheelchair-user combination. This article aims to review      relevant scientific literature that has investigated the effects of wheelchair      configuration on aspects of mobility performance from an ergonomics perspective.       Optimizing performance from an ergonomics perspective requires a      multidisciplinary approach. This has resulted in laboratory-based investigations       incorporating a combination of physiological and biomechanical analyses to assess      the efficiency, health/safety and comfort of various wheelchair configurations.      To a lesser extent, field-based testing has also been incorporated to determine      the effects of wheelchair configuration on aspects of mobility performance      specific to the wheelchair court sports. The available literature has      demonstrated that areas of seat positioning, rear wheel camber, wheel size and      hand-rim configurations can all influence the ergonomics of wheelchair      performance. Certain configurations have been found to elevate the physiological       demand of wheelchair propulsion, others have been associated with an increased      risk of injury and some have demonstrated favourable performance on court. A      consideration of all these factors is required to identify optimal wheelchair      configurations. Unfortunately, a wide variety of different methodologies have      immerged between studies, many of which are accompanied by limitations, thus      making the identification of optimal configurations problematic. When      investigating an area of wheelchair configuration, many studies have failed to      adequately standardize other areas, which has prevented reliable cause and effect      relationships being established. In addition, a large number of studies have      explored the effects of wheelchair configuration in either able-bodied      populations or in daily life or racing wheelchairs. As such, the findings are not      specific and transferable to athletes competing in the wheelchair court sports.      This review presents evidence about the effects of wheelchair configuration on      aspects of mobility performance specific to the wheelchair court sports to better      inform athletes, coaches and manufacturers about the consequences of their      selections. It also provides researchers with guidance on the design of future      investigations into areas of wheelchair configuration, which are essential.FAU - Mason, Barry SAU  - Mason BSAD  - Peter Harrison Centre for Disability Sport, School of Sport, Exercise and Health       Sciences, Loughborough University, Epinal Way, Loughborough, LE11 3TU, UK.      b.mason@lboro.ac.ukFAU - van der Woude, Lucas H VAU  - van der Woude LHFAU - Goosey-Tolfrey, Victoria LAU  - Goosey-Tolfrey VLLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPT  - ReviewPL  - New ZealandTA  - Sports MedJT  - Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)JID - 8412297SB  - IMMH  - Athletic Performance/*physiologyMH  - Basketball/physiologyMH  - Biomechanical PhenomenaMH  - Databases, BibliographicMH  - Equipment DesignMH  - Equipment Safety/methods/standardsMH  - Football/physiologyMH  - *Human EngineeringMH  - HumansMH  - Sports/*physiologyMH  - Tennis/physiologyMH  - Wheelchairs/*standardsEDAT- 2013/01/15 06:00MHDA- 2013/06/20 06:00CRDT- 2013/01/15 06:00AID - 10.1007/s40279-012-0005-x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Sports Med. 2013 Jan;43(1):23-38. doi: 10.1007/s40279-012-0005-x.PMID- 23315752OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20130114DCOM- 20130619IS  - 1179-2035 (Electronic)IS  - 0112-1642 (Linking)VI  - 43IP  - 1DP  - 2013 JanTI  - Self-organization processes in field-invasion team sports : implications for      leadership.PG  - 1-7LID - 10.1007/s40279-012-0001-1 [doi]AB  - In nature, the interactions between agents in a complex system (fish schools;      colonies of ants) are governed by information that is locally created. Each agent      self-organizes (adjusts) its behaviour, not through a central command centre, but      based on variables that emerge from the interactions with other system agents in       the neighbourhood. Self-organization has been proposed as a mechanism to explain       the tendencies for individual performers to interact with each other in      field-invasion sports teams, displaying functional co-adaptive behaviours,      without the need for central control. The relevance of self-organization as a      mechanism that explains pattern-forming dynamics within attacker-defender      interactions in field-invasion sports has been sustained in the literature.      Nonetheless, other levels of interpersonal coordination, such as intra-team      interactions, still raise important questions, particularly with reference to the      role of leadership or match strategies that have been prescribed in advance by a       coach. The existence of key properties of complex systems, such as system      degeneracy, nonlinearity or contextual dependency, suggests that      self-organization is a functional mechanism to explain the emergence of      interpersonal coordination tendencies within intra-team interactions. In this      opinion article we propose how leadership may act as a key constraint on the      emergent, self-organizational tendencies of performers in field-invasion sports.FAU - Passos, PedroAU  - Passos PAD  - Faculty of Human Kinetics, Technical University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.      ppassos@fmh.utl.ptFAU - Araujo, DuarteAU  - Araujo DFAU - Davids, KeithAU  - Davids KLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - New ZealandTA  - Sports MedJT  - Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)JID - 8412297SB  - IMMH  - Athletic Performance/*psychologyMH  - *Competitive BehaviorMH  - *Cooperative BehaviorMH  - HumansMH  - *Interpersonal RelationsMH  - *LeadershipMH  - Sports/*psychologyEDAT- 2013/01/15 06:00MHDA- 2013/06/20 06:00CRDT- 2013/01/15 06:00AID - 10.1007/s40279-012-0001-1 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Sports Med. 2013 Jan;43(1):1-7. doi: 10.1007/s40279-012-0001-1.PMID- 23288443OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20130312DCOM- 20140305IS  - 1176-7529 (Print)IS  - 1176-7529 (Linking)VI  - 10IP  - 1DP  - 2013 MarTI  - Return-to-play confusion: considerations for sport-related concussion.PG  - 127-8LID - 10.1007/s11673-012-9421-8 [doi]FAU - Clacy, AmandaAU  - Clacy AAD  - School of Social Sciences, University of the Sunshine Coast, Sippy Downs,      Australia 4556. aclacy@usc.edu.auFAU - Sharman, RachaelAU  - Sharman RFAU - Lovell, GeoffAU  - Lovell GLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20130104PL  - NetherlandsTA  - J Bioeth InqJT  - Journal of bioethical inquiryJID - 101250741SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Brain Concussion/*psychologyMH  - Decision Making/*ethicsMH  - Football/*injuriesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - *Mental CompetencyMH  - Sports Medicine/*ethicsEDAT- 2013/01/05 06:00MHDA- 2014/03/07 06:00CRDT- 2013/01/05 06:00PHST- 2012/11/22 [received]PHST- 2012/12/10 [accepted]PHST- 2013/01/04 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1007/s11673-012-9421-8 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Bioeth Inq. 2013 Mar;10(1):127-8. doi: 10.1007/s11673-012-9421-8.

The      ISSN has concluded the following. 1. Although ED and ES contain a number of      nutrients that are purported to affect mental and/or physical performance, the      primary ergogenic nutrients in most ED and ES appear to be carbohydrate and/or      caffeine. 2. The ergogenic value of caffeine on mental and physical performance      has been well-established but the potential additive benefits of other nutrients       contained in ED and ES remains to be determined. 3. Consuming ED 10-60 minutes      before exercise can improve mental focus, alertness, anaerobic performance,      and/or endurance performance. 4. Many ED and ES contain numerous ingredients;      these products in particular merit further study to demonstrate their safety and       potential effects on physical and mental performance. 5. There is some limited      evidence that consumption of low-calorie ED during training and/or weight loss      trials may provide ergogenic benefit and/or promote a small amount of additional       fat loss. However, ingestion of higher calorie ED may promote weight gain if the       energy intake from consumption of ED is not carefully considered as part of the      total daily energy intake. 6. Athletes should consider the impact of ingesting      high glycemic load carbohydrates on metabolic health, blood glucose and insulin      levels, as well as the effects of caffeine and other stimulants on motor skill      performance. 7. Children and adolescents should only consider use of ED or ES      with parental approval after consideration of the amount of carbohydrate,      caffeine, and other nutrients contained in the ED or ES and a thorough      understanding of the potential side effects. 8. Indiscriminant use of ED or ES,      especially if more than one serving per day is consumed, may lead to adverse      events and harmful side effects. 9. Diabetics and individuals with pre-existing      cardiovascular, metabolic, hepatorenal, and neurologic disease who are taking      medications that may be affected by high glycemic load foods, caffeine, and/or      other stimulants should avoid use of ED and/or ES unless approved by their      physician.FAU - Campbell, BillAU  - Campbell BAD  - Exercise & Sport Nutrition Lab, Department of Health & Kinesiology, Texas A&M      University, College Station, Texas, TX, 77843-4243, USA. rkreider@hlkn.tamu.edu.FAU - Wilborn, ColinAU  - Wilborn CFAU - La Bounty, PaulAU  - La Bounty PFAU - Taylor, LemAU  - Taylor LFAU - Nelson, Mike TAU  - Nelson MTFAU - Greenwood, MikeAU  - Greenwood MFAU - Ziegenfuss, Tim NAU  - Ziegenfuss TNFAU - Lopez, Hector LAU  - Lopez HLFAU - Hoffman, Jay RAU  - Hoffman JRFAU - Stout, Jeffrey RAU  - Stout JRFAU - Schmitz, StephenAU  - Schmitz SFAU - Collins, RickAU  - Collins RFAU - Kalman, Doug SAU  - Kalman DSFAU - Antonio, JoseAU  - Antonio JFAU - Kreider, Richard BAU  - Kreider RBLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20130103PL  - United StatesTA  - J Int Soc Sports NutrJT  - Journal of the International Society of Sports NutritionJID - 101234168PMC - PMC3538552OID - NLM: PMC3538552EDAT- 2013/01/04 06:00MHDA- 2013/01/04 06:01CRDT- 2013/01/04 06:00PHST- 2012/12/28 [received]PHST- 2012/12/31 [accepted]PHST- 2013/01/03 [aheadofprint]AID - 1550-2783-10-1 [pii]AID - 10.1186/1550-2783-10-1 [doi]PST - epublishSO  - J Int Soc Sports Nutr. 2013 Jan 3;10(1):1. doi: 10.1186/1550-2783-10-1.PMID- 23277754OWN - NLMSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINEDA  - 20130101DCOM- 20130102LR  - 20130529IS  - 1205-7088 (Print)IS  - 1205-7088 (Linking)VI  - 17IP  - 1DP  - 2012 JanTI  - Evaluation and management of children and adolescents with sports-related      concussion.PG  - 31-4AB  - Concussions are common sport injuries, and are particularly common among children      and adolescents involved in organized sports and recreational activities.      Symptoms of concussion can be subtle, and may be overlooked by athletes,      coaches/trainers and parents. If a child or youth sustains a concussion, they      should immediately be removed from play and assessed by a physician as soon as      possible. The athlete should rest from physical and cognitive activities to allow      for recovery from concussion. Once symptoms have completely resolved at rest, the      athlete can progress through a medically supervised stepwise exertion protocol      before being medically cleared to return to play. It is imperative that everyone       involved in child and youth sports be aware of the signs and symptoms of      concussion so that an accurate and timely diagnosis can be made, and proper      evaluation and management instituted.

Given this apparent dilemma, this study      investigated the perceptions of sport science from coaches across four different       sports (football, rugby league, curling and judo) across three different levels      (elite, developmental and novice). Specifically, 58 coaches (19 football; 21      rugby league; 9 curling; 9 judo) drawn evenly from novice, developmental and      elite groups agreed to take part and were interviewed. Three key features emerged      from the analysis 1) Practical application and relevance 2) Integration and      access, 3) Language. In short, there was significant variability in the extent to      which sport science was considered relevant and to whom, although interestingly      this was not strongly related to coaching level. This inconsistency of      understanding was a barrier to sport science engagement in some instances, as was      the challenge of operationalising information for specific contexts. Furthermore,      availability of opportunities and resources were often left to chance, while      overuse of jargon and inability for research and practitioners to consider sport       specific needs were also considered barriers to engagement. Implications for      research and practice are discussed.FAU - Martindale, RussellAU  - Martindale RAD  - Edinburgh Napier University, SLSSS, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.      r.martindale@napier.ac.ukFAU - Nash, ChristineAU  - Nash CLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20121219PL  - EnglandTA  - J Sports SciJT  - Journal of sports sciencesJID - 8405364SB  - IMMH  - *ComprehensionMH  - Great BritainMH  - *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, PracticeMH  - HumansMH  - Interviews as TopicMH  - *PerceptionMH  - *Physical Education and TrainingMH  - *ResearchMH  - *ScienceMH  - *SportsEDAT- 2012/12/20 06:00MHDA- 2013/09/18 06:00CRDT- 2012/12/20 06:00PHST- 2012/12/19 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1080/02640414.2012.754924 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Sci. 2013;31(8):807-19. doi: 10.1080/02640414.2012.754924.

However, despite accurate      diagnosis, effective treatment and management of sports-related concussion have      remained a challenge. There are approximately 1.8 million traumatic brain      injuries in the United States annually (Faul et al., 2010) and emergency      department pediatric visits for suspected concussion have doubled in the past      decade (Bakhos et al., 2010). However, health care providers and medical      researchers have yet to offer an effective, reliable evidence-based treatment for      concussive brain injury. The Zurich 2008 Consensus Statement on Concussion in      Sport codified the prescription for cognitive and physical rest immediately      following a concussion based on clinical acumen and common sense (McCrory et al.,      2009). Currently, rest is the considered the best immediate treatment for      concussion. Other supportive and anecdotal treatments are often applied      throughout the post-concussive recovery process to address persistent symptoms.      The need for empirical research to translate current guidelines for rest into      evidence-based treatment protocols is essential. A recent study evaluated the      efficacy of comprehensive rest and concluded that such rest may be helpful      whether applied soon after a concussion or weeks to months later (Moser et al.,      2012). Here, we present a case illustrating the effectiveness of rest in a youth       athlete, commenced after experiencing 13 months of post-concussion symptoms.      There appears to be value in applying a specific period of cognitive and physical      rest following concussion, whether immediately or later in the recovery phase.FAU - Moser, Rosemarie ScolaroAU  - Moser RSAD  - Sports Concussion Center of New Jersey Lawrenceville, NJ, USA ; International      Brain Research Foundation Flanders, NJ, USA.FAU - Schatz, PhilipAU  - Schatz PLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20121211PL  - SwitzerlandTA  - Front NeurolJT  - Frontiers in neurologyJID - 101546899PMC - PMC3518809OID - NLM: PMC3518809OTO - NOTNLMOT  - cognitive restOT  - concussionOT  - mild traumatic brain injuryOT  - sports concussionOT  - treatment of concussionOT  - youth concussionEDAT- 2012/12/19 06:00MHDA- 2012/12/19 06:01CRDT- 2012/12/19 06:00PHST- 2011/08/13 [received]PHST- 2012/11/10 [accepted]PHST- 2012/12/11 [epublish]AID - 10.3389/fneur.2012.00171 [doi]PST - epublishSO  - Front Neurol. 2012 Dec 11;3:171. doi: 10.3389/fneur.2012.00171. eCollection 2012.PMID- 23247620OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20121218DCOM- 20131114IS  - 0937-2032 (Print)IS  - 0937-2032 (Linking)VI  - 62IP  - 12DP  - 2012 DecTI  - [Sportstherapy for outpatients with eating disorders: a pilot project].PG  - 456-62LID - 10.1055/s-0032-1316370 [doi]AB  - Many patients with Anorexia and Bulimia Nervosa (AN, BN) engage in sport and      physical activity in an excessive and compulsive manner, mostly to influence      weight and shape.

IMPORTANCE OF AN AMSSM      STATEMENT: black triangle right Sports medicine physicians are frequently      involved in the care of patients with sports concussion. black triangle right      Sports medicine physicians are specifically trained to provide care along the      continuum of sports concussion from the acute injury to return-to-play (RTP)      decisions. black triangle right The care of athletes with sports concussion is      ideally performed by healthcare professionals with specific training and      experience in the assessment and management of concussion. Competence should be      determined by training and experience, not dictated by specialty. black triangle       right While this statement is directed towards sports medicine physicians, it may      also assist other physicians and healthcare professionals in the care of patients      with sports concussion. DEFINITION: black triangle right Concussion is defined as      a traumatically induced transient disturbance of brain function and involves a      complex pathophysiological process. Concussion is a subset of mild traumatic      brain injury (MTBI) which is generally self-limited and at the less-severe end of      the brain injury spectrum. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY: black triangle right Animal and human      studies support the concept of postconcussive vulnerability, showing that a      second blow before the brain has recovered results in worsening metabolic changes      within the cell. black triangle right Experimental evidence suggests the      concussed brain is less responsive to usual neural activation and when premature       cognitive or physical activity occurs before complete recovery the brain may be      vulnerable to prolonged dysfunction. INCIDENCE: black triangle right It is      estimated that as many as 3.8 million concussions occur in the USA per year      during competitive sports and recreational activities; however, as many as 50% of      the concussions may go unreported. black triangle right Concussions occur in all       sports with the highest incidence in football, hockey, rugby, soccer and      basketball. RISK FACTORS FOR SPORT-RELATED CONCUSSION: black triangle right A      history of concussion is associated with a higher risk of sustaining another      concussion. black triangle right A greater number, severity and duration of      symptoms after a concussion are predictors of a prolonged recovery. black      triangle right In sports with similar playing rules, the reported incidence of      concussion is higher in female athletes than in male athletes. black triangle      right Certain sports, positions and individual playing styles have a greater risk      of concussion. black triangle right Youth athletes may have a more prolonged      recovery and are more susceptible to a concussion accompanied by a catastrophic      injury. black triangle right Preinjury mood disorders, learning disorders,      attention-deficit disorders (ADD/ADHD) and migraine headaches complicate      diagnosis and management of a concussion. DIAGNOSIS OF CONCUSSION: black triangle      right Concussion remains a clinical diagnosis ideally made by a healthcare      provider familiar with the athlete and knowledgeable in the recognition and      evaluation of concussion. black triangle right Graded symptom checklists provide       an objective tool for assessing a variety of symptoms related to concussions,      while also tracking the severity of those symptoms over serial evaluations. black      triangle right Standardised assessment tools provide a helpful structure for the       evaluation of concussion, although limited validation of these assessment tools      is available. SIDELINE EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT: black triangle right Any      athlete suspected of having a concussion should be stopped from playing and      assessed by a licenced healthcare provider trained in the evaluation and      management of concussions. black triangle right Recognition and initial      assessment of a concussion should be guided by a symptoms checklist, cognitive      evaluation (including orientation, past and immediate memory, new learning and      concentration), balance tests and further neurological physical examination.      black triangle right While standardised sideline tests are a useful framework for      examination, the sensitivity, specificity, validity and reliability of these      tests among different age groups, cultural groups and settings is largely      undefined. Their practical usefulness with or without an individual baseline test      is also largely unknown. black triangle right Balance disturbance is a specific      indicator of a concussion, but not very sensitive. Balance testing on the      sideline may be substantially different than baseline tests because of      differences in shoe/cleat-type or surface, use of ankle tape or braces, or the      presence of other lower extremity injury. black triangle right Imaging is      reserved for athletes where intracerebral bleeding is suspected. black triangle      right There is no same day RTP for an athlete diagnosed with a concussion. black       triangle right Athletes suspected or diagnosed with a concussion should be      monitored for deteriorating physical or mental status. NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL      TESTING: black triangle right Neuropsychological (NP) tests are an objective      measure of brain-behaviour relationships and are more sensitive for subtle      cognitive impairment than clinical exam. black triangle right Most concussions      can be managed appropriately without the use of NP testing. black triangle right       Computerised neuropsychological (CNP) testing should be interpreted by healthcare      professionals trained and familiar with the type of test and the individual test       limitations, including a knowledgeable assessment of the reliable change index,      baseline variability and false-positive and false-negative rates. black triangle       right Paper and pencil NP tests can be more comprehensive, test different domains      and assess for other conditions which may masquerade as or complicate assessment       of concussion. black triangle right NP testing should be used only as part of a      comprehensive concussion management strategy and should not be used in isolation.      black triangle right The ideal timing, frequency and type of NP testing have not       been determined. black triangle right In some cases, properly administered and      interpreted NP testing provides an added value to assess cognitive function and      recovery in the management of sports concussions. black triangle right It is      unknown if use of NP testing in the management of sports concussion helps prevent      recurrent concussion, catastrophic injury or long-term complications. black      triangle right Comprehensive NP evaluation is helpful in the post-concussion      management of athletes with persistent symptoms or complicated courses. RETURN TO      CLASS: black triangle right Students will require cognitive rest and may require       academic accommodations such as reduced workload and extended time for tests      while recovering from a concussion. RETURN TO PLAY: black triangle right      Concussion symptoms should be resolved before returning to exercise. black      triangle right A RTP progression involves a gradual, step-wise increase in      physical demands, sports-specific activities and the risk for contact. black      triangle right If symptoms occur with activity, the progression should be halted       and restarted at the preceding symptom-free step. black triangle right RTP after       concussion should occur only with medical clearance from a licenced healthcare      provider trained in the evaluation and management of concussions. SHORT-TERM      RISKS OF PREMATURE RTP: black triangle right The primary concern with early RTP      is decreased reaction time leading to an increased risk of a repeat concussion or      other injury and prolongation of symptoms. LONG-TERM EFFECTS: black triangle      right There is an increasing concern that head impact exposure and recurrent      concussions contribute to long-term neurological sequelae. black triangle right      Some studies have suggested an association between prior concussions and chronic       cognitive dysfunction. Large-scale epidemiological studies are needed to more      clearly define risk factors and causation of any long-term neurological      impairment. DISQUALIFICATION FROM SPORT: black triangle right There are no      evidence-based guidelines for disqualifying/retiring an athlete from a sport      after a concussion. Each case should be carefully deliberated and an      individualised approach to determining disqualification taken. EDUCATION: black      triangle right Greater efforts are needed to educate involved parties, including       athletes, parents, coaches, officials, school administrators and healthcare      providers to improve concussion recognition, management and prevention. black      triangle right Physicians should be prepared to provide counselling regarding      potential long-term consequences of a concussion and recurrent concussions.      PREVENTION: black triangle right Primary prevention of some injuries may be      possible with modification and enforcement of the rules and fair play. black      triangle right Helmets, both hard (football, lacrosse and hockey) and soft      (soccer, rugby) are best suited to prevent impact injuries (fracture, bleeding,      laceration, etc.) but have not been shown to reduce the incidence and severity of      concussions. black triangle right There is no current evidence that mouth guards       can reduce the severity of or prevent concussions. black triangle right Secondary      prevention may be possible by appropriate RTP management. LEGISLATION: black      triangle right Legislative efforts provide a uniform standard for scholastic and       non-scholastic sports organisations regarding concussion safety and management.      FUTURE DIRECTIONS: black triangle right Additional research is needed to validate      current assessment tools, delineate the role of NP testing and improve      identification of those at risk of prolonged post-concussive symptoms or other      long-term complications. black triangle right Evolving technologies for the      diagnosis of concussion, such as newer neuroimaging techniques or biological      markers, may provide new insights into the evaluation and management of sports      concussion.FAU - Harmon, Kimberly GAU  - Harmon KGAD  - Department of Family Medicine, for Stanley Herring Department of Physical      Medicine and Rehabilitation, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.       kharmon@u.washington.eduFAU - Drezner, Jonathan AAU  - Drezner JAFAU - Gammons, MatthewAU  - Gammons MFAU - Guskiewicz, Kevin MAU  - Guskiewicz KMFAU - Halstead, MarkAU  - Halstead MFAU - Herring, Stanley AAU  - Herring SAFAU - Kutcher, Jeffrey SAU  - Kutcher JSFAU - Pana, AndreaAU  - Pana AFAU - Putukian, MargotAU  - Putukian MFAU - Roberts, William OAU  - Roberts WOLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - EnglandTA  - Br J Sports MedJT  - British journal of sports medicineJID - 0432520RN  - 0 (Apolipoproteins E)SB  - IMEIN - Br J Sports Med. 2013 Feb;47(3):184MH  - Age FactorsMH  - Apolipoproteins E/geneticsMH  - Athletic Injuries/diagnosis/etiology/*therapyMH  - Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/complicationsMH  - Brain Concussion/diagnosis/etiology/*therapyMH  - Emergency Treatment/methodsMH  - Evidence-Based MedicineMH  - FemaleMH  - ForecastingMH  - Health Education/methodsMH  - HumansMH  - Learning Disorders/complicationsMH  - MaleMH  - Migraine Disorders/complicationsMH  - Mood Disorders/complicationsMH  - Neuroimaging/methodsMH  - Neurologic Examination/methodsMH  - Neuropsychological TestsMH  - Polymorphism, Genetic/geneticsMH  - Postural BalanceMH  - PrognosisMH  - Recovery of FunctionMH  - Referral and ConsultationMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Sensation Disorders/diagnosis/etiologyMH  - Sex FactorsMH  - Sports Medicine/*methodsMH  - Time FactorsEDAT- 2012/12/18 06:00MHDA- 2013/05/18 06:00CRDT- 2012/12/18 06:00AID - 47/1/15 [pii]AID - 10.1136/bjsports-2012-091941 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Br J Sports Med. 2013 Jan;47(1):15-26. doi: 10.1136/bjsports-2012-091941.PMID- 23231784OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20131218DCOM- 20140820IS  - 1473-0480 (Electronic)IS  - 0306-3674 (Linking)VI  - 48IP  - 2DP  - 2014 JanTI  - Planning the diffusion of a neck-injury prevention programme among community      rugby union coaches.PG  - 151-9LID - 10.1136/bjsports-2012-091551 [doi]AB  - BACKGROUND: This paper describes the development of a theory-informed and      evidence-informed, context-specific diffusion plan for the Mayday Safety      Procedure (MSP) among community rugby coaches in regional New South Wales,      Australia. METHODS: Step 5 of Intervention Mapping was used to plan strategies to      enhance MSP adoption and implementation. RESULTS: Coaches were identified as the       primary MSP adopters and implementers within a system including administrators,      players and referees. A local advisory group was established to ensure context      relevance. Performance objectives (eg, attend MSP training for coaches) and      determinants of adoption and implementation behaviour (eg, knowledge, beliefs,      skills and environment) were identified, informed by Social Cognitive Theory.      Adoption and implementation matrices were developed and change-objectives for      coaches were identified (eg, skills to deliver MSP training to players). Finally,      intervention methods and specific strategies (eg, coach education, social      marketing and policy and by-law development) were identified based on advisory      group member experience, evidence of effective coach safety behaviour-change      interventions and Diffusion of Innovations theory. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first      published example of a systematic approach to plan injury prevention programme      diffusion in community sports. The key strengths of this approach were an      effective researcher-practitioner partnership; actively engaging local sports      administrators; targeting specific behaviour determinants, informed by theory and      evidence; and taking context-related practical strengths and constraints into      consideration. The major challenges were the time involved in using a systematic       diffusion planning approach for the first time; and finding a planning language      that was acceptable and meaningful to researchers and practitioners.FAU - Donaldson, AlexAU  - Donaldson AAD  - Australian Centre for Research into Injury in Sport and its Prevention (ACRISP),       Monash Injury Research Institute (MIRI), Monash University, , Melbourne,      Victoria, Australia.FAU - Poulos, Roslyn GAU  - Poulos RGLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20121211PL  - EnglandTA  - Br J Sports MedJT  - British journal of sports medicineJID - 0432520SB  - IMMH  - Diffusion of InnovationMH  - Football/education/*injuriesMH  - Health Education/*organization & administrationMH  - Health Knowledge, Attitudes, PracticeMH  - Health Planning/*organization & administrationMH  - HumansMH  - Neck Injuries/*prevention & controlMH  - New South WalesMH  - Patient SafetyMH  - Professional PracticeMH  - Public PolicyMH  - Sports Medicine/organization & administrationOTO - NOTNLMOT  - ImplementationOT  - Injury PreventionOT  - RugbyOT  - Sporting InjuriesEDAT- 2012/12/13 06:00MHDA- 2014/08/21 06:00CRDT- 2012/12/13 06:00PHST- 2012/12/11 [aheadofprint]AID - bjsports-2012-091551 [pii]AID - 10.1136/bjsports-2012-091551 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Br J Sports Med. 2014 Jan;48(2):151-9. doi: 10.1136/bjsports-2012-091551.

The Paralympic Games, seen      as the pinnacle sporting event that represents the broader Paralympic Movement,      has provided a platform to showcase the abilities of people with disabilities      while also serving as a catalyst for disability rights through ensuring      integration, equality of opportunity, and accessibility of the built environment.      Concurrently, media coverage of the Paralympic Games has led to an increased      awareness of opportunities for sport participation for individuals with      disabilities and, with it, the adjustment of norms regarding expectations for      exercise as a component of preventive health. In addition, there is evidence of      the power of sports to stimulate confidence, self-efficacy, and a self-perceived       high quality of life for individuals with disabilities above and beyond the basic      benefits to cardiometabolic fitness. When taken together, the promotion of      health, disability rights, and social integration through sports has the power to      transform the lives of those who participate and to further stimulate the      expansion of opportunities available to the next generation of athletes with      disabilities.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.

This      article will explore the relationship of practice injury rates by fall, winter,      and spring sports as well as by Divisions I, II, and III. DESIGN: Descriptive      epidemiology study. SETTING: NCAA schools. PATIENTS: NCAA athletes. MAIN OUTCOME       MEASURES: Injury. RESULTS: In all sports across all seasons, preseason practice      injury rates [6.3 per 1000 athletic exposure (A-E)] were higher than in-season      (2.3 per 1000 A-E). Fall sports had an overall preseason practice injury rate of       7.4 (per 1000 A-E) compared with 7.0 (per 1000 A-E) for winter and 3.5 (per 1000       A-E) for spring sports. Women's soccer had the highest preseason injury rate of      9.5 (per 1000 A-E). Men's football had the highest increased risk of injury      comparing preseason with in-season practice injury (3.47 per 1000 A-E).      CONCLUSIONS: The recognition that preseason practice injury rates are higher      compared with in-season and postseason practice injury rates can create an      opportunity for athletes, coaches, and medical personnel to identify prevention      strategies to reduce preseason injury risk.FAU - Agel, JulieAU  - Agel JAD  - Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and Sports Medicine, Harborview Medical Center,      Seattle, WA, USA. bagel@u.washington.eduFAU - Schisel, JessicaAU  - Schisel JLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Clin J Sport MedJT  - Clinical journal of sport medicine : official journal of the Canadian Academy of       Sport MedicineJID - 9103300SB  - IMMH  - Athletic Injuries/*epidemiology/etiologyMH  - FemaleMH  - *Health Status DisparitiesMH  - HumansMH  - IncidenceMH  - MaleMH  - *SeasonsMH  - Sex FactorsMH  - United States/epidemiologyMH  - *UniversitiesEDAT- 2012/11/20 06:00MHDA- 2013/05/31 06:00CRDT- 2012/11/20 06:00AID - 10.1097/JSM.0b013e3182717983 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Clin J Sport Med. 2013 Jan;23(1):33-8. doi: 10.1097/JSM.0b013e3182717983.PMID- 23159996OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20130821DCOM- 20140414IS  - 1524-8399 (Print)IS  - 1524-8399 (Linking)VI  - 14IP  - 5DP  - 2013 SepTI  - Linking physical education with community sport and recreation: a program for      adolescent girls.PG  - 721-31LID - 10.1177/1524839912464229 [doi]AB  - The engagement of adolescent girls in physical activity (PA) is a persistent      challenge. School-based PA programs have often met with little success because of      the lack of linkages between school and community PA settings. The Triple G      program aimed to improve PA levels of secondary school girls (12-15 years) in      regional Victoria, Australia. The program included a school-based physical      education (PE) component that uniquely incorporated student-centered teaching and      behavioral skill development. The school component was conceptually and      practically linked to a community component that emphasized appropriate      structures for participation. The program was informed by ethnographic fieldwork       to understand the contextual factors that affect girls' participation in PA. A      collaborative intervention design was undertaken to align with PE curriculum and       coaching and instructional approaches in community PA settings. The theoretical      framework for the intervention was the socioecological model that was underpinned      by both individual-level (social cognitive theory) and organizational-level      (building organizational/community capacity) strategies. The program model      provides an innovative conceptual framework for linking school PE with community       sport and recreation and may benefit other PA programs seeking to engage      adolescent girls. The objective of this article is to describe program      development and the unique theoretical framework and curriculum approaches.FAU - Casey, MeghanAU  - Casey MAD  - University of Ballarat, Ballarat, Victoria, Australia. m.casey@ballarat.edu.auFAU - Mooney, AmandaAU  - Mooney AFAU - Eime, RochelleAU  - Eime RFAU - Harvey, JackAU  - Harvey JFAU - Smyth, JohnAU  - Smyth JFAU - Telford, AmandaAU  - Telford AFAU - Payne, WarrenAU  - Payne WLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20121116PL  - United StatesTA  - Health Promot PractJT  - Health promotion practiceJID - 100890609SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Capacity BuildingMH  - ChildMH  - *ExerciseMH  - FemaleMH  - Health Promotion/*organization & administrationMH  - HumansMH  - LeadershipMH  - Peer GroupMH  - Physical Education and Training/*organization & administrationMH  - Problem SolvingMH  - Program DevelopmentMH  - RecreationMH  - Social SupportMH  - *SportsMH  - VictoriaOTO - NOTNLMOT  - communityOT  - intervention designOT  - physical activityOT  - physical educationOT  - sportEDAT- 2012/11/20 06:00MHDA- 2014/04/15 06:00CRDT- 2012/11/20 06:00PHST- 2012/11/16 [aheadofprint]AID - 1524839912464229 [pii]AID - 10.1177/1524839912464229 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Health Promot Pract. 2013 Sep;14(5):721-31. doi: 10.1177/1524839912464229.

Therefore, it seems crucial to identify factors      influencing competitive anxiety of adolescent athletes. Research suggests that      people reporting high quality of life are more capable to cope with stressful and      challenging situations than others. The aim of this study was to investigate the       impact of quality of life, the involvement of parents in sports career and      coach's leadership behaviour on competitive anxiety in Winter Youth Olympic Games      participants. METHODS: During the first Winter Youth Olympic Games 2012 in      Innsbruck/Austria, 662 (316 women) participants completed questionnaires and      single items to assess quality of life, coach's leadership behaviour, parental      involvement in sports career and competitive anxiety. RESULTS: Multiple      regression analysis revealed positive influences of high quality of life and      useful coach instruction on competitive anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship      between quality of life, coach behaviour and competitive anxiety in young elite      athletes competing at the first Winter Youth Olympic Games should be considered      in long-term programmes for reducing competitive stress.FAU - Ledochowski, LarissaAU  - Ledochowski LAD  - Department of Sport Science, University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck 6020, Austria.      larissa.ledochowski@uibk.ac.atFAU - Unterrainer, ChristineAU  - Unterrainer CFAU - Ruedl, GerhardAU  - Ruedl GFAU - Schnitzer, MartinAU  - Schnitzer MFAU - Kopp, MartinAU  - Kopp MLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - EnglandTA  - Br J Sports MedJT  - British journal of sports medicineJID - 0432520SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Anxiety/*etiologyMH  - Athletic Performance/psychologyMH  - AustriaMH  - Competitive Behavior/*physiologyMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - *Interpersonal RelationsMH  - LeadershipMH  - MaleMH  - Practice (Psychology)MH  - *Quality of LifeMH  - Snow Sports/*psychologyMH  - Sports MedicineEDAT- 2012/11/14 06:00MHDA- 2013/05/01 06:00CRDT- 2012/11/14 06:00AID - 46/15/1044 [pii]AID - 10.1136/bjsports-2012-091539 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Br J Sports Med. 2012 Dec;46(15):1044-7. doi: 10.1136/bjsports-2012-091539.PMID- 23134807OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20121203DCOM- 20130522IS  - 1873-3379 (Electronic)IS  - 0891-4222 (Linking)VI  - 34IP  - 1DP  - 2013 JanTI  - The effects of a Special Olympics Unified Sports Soccer training program on      anthropometry, physical fitness and skilled performance in Special Olympics      soccer athletes and non-disabled partners.PG  - 695-709LID - 10.1016/j.ridd.2012.10.003 [doi]LID - S0891-4222(12)00258-2 [pii]AB  - The study investigated the effects of a Special Olympics (SO) Unified Sport (UNS)      soccer program on anthropometry, physical fitness and soccer skills of male youth      athletes with and without intellectual disabilities (ID) who participated in a      training group (TRG) and in a comparison group (CG) without specific training.      Youth with ID (WID) were randomly selected out of all the students between the      ages 12 and 15, with a diagnosis of educable mental retardation and no secondary       disabilities, who were attending a special education school. Participants without      ID (WoID) were randomly selected from a regular secondary school out of the same       age groups of male students. All participants were given permission by their      parents or guardians to participate in the study. Participants in the TRG      included 23 youth WID and 23 youth WoID. Mean ages were = 14.1 (SD = 1.1) and      13.2 (SD = 0.79) respectively. Fifteen WID, and 15 WoID comprised the CG. Mean      ages were 14.51 (SD = 0.81) and 13.78 (SD = 0.49) respectively. Prior to and      following the program measurements were conducted, and data were collected on      students' anthropometric and fitness components of the Brockport physical fitness      test as well as a soccer skill performance based on the SO soccer skill test.      Participants in the TRG trained 8 weeks, 1.5h per session, three times per week,       in an after-school soccer program. CG did not participate in any sports program      outside of the school physical education class. Dependent t tests and effect size      calculations revealed that SO athletes and non-disabled partners scored      significantly higher with regard to physical fitness and football skills in most       variables compared with their CG. This Unified Program was successful in      increasing fitness and soccer skill performance of youth WID as well as of those       WoID.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Commonly developed by      former players and coaches, this information is generally based on anecdotal      evidence and in general lacks the scientific rigour of a peer-reviewed journal.      Thus there is a need to establish the level of agreement and support between the       coaching and biomechanical literature. In doing so, evidence-based coaching      practices can be optimally developed. Moreover, this will ensure the technique      and skill development practices implemented at grass-roots level are supported by      successful performance in the later stages of player development. The purpose of       this review was to evaluate the latest batting biomechanics research, providing a      comprehensive and up-to-date insight into the kinematic and kinetic aspects of      batting in cricket. Furthermore, this review compared and contrasted this      research with a selection of coaching literature, establishing a strong level of       support and agreement between the coaching and biomechanical literature in      recommendations for cricket batting technique. Although the ambiguity in a number      of coaching concepts still exists, coaches and players can be confident in the      successful implementation of both sources of information in a player's technical       development.FAU - Penn, Melissa JAU  - Penn MJAD  - School of Leisure, Sport and Tourism, University of Technology, Sydney,      Australia. melissa.penn@mail.comFAU - Spratford, WayneAU  - Spratford WLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - ScotlandTA  - Sports BiomechJT  - Sports biomechanics / International Society of Biomechanics in SportsJID - 101151352SB  - IMMH  - Athletic Performance/*physiologyMH  - Biomechanical PhenomenaMH  - HumansMH  - Sports/*physiologyEDAT- 2012/10/18 06:00MHDA- 2012/11/07 06:00CRDT- 2012/10/18 06:00AID - 10.1080/14763141.2011.638387 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Sports Biomech. 2012 Sep;11(3):311-23.PMID- 23061214OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20121015DCOM- 20121101IS  - 0010-6178 (Print)IS  - 0010-6178 (Linking)VI  - 76IP  - 8DP  - 2012 SepTI  - Returning to sports after total joint replacements and tibial osteotomies: is it       possible?PG  - 483-5AB  - Total joint replacement and tibial osteotomies have been used for decades to      return the individual to activities and relieve pain. According to the American      Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, joint replacement is considered one of the most       successful medical innovations of the 20th century. Hip and knee-replacement      operations are increasing in frequency and are continuing to achieve pain relief       and improve function for patients with arthritic joints. Demand for knee      replacement is expected to double over the next five to 10 years and for hip      replacement, it is expected to double over the next 10 to 15 years. The trend for      joint replacement has begun to include the younger as well as the older still      active individual. Younger patients are considering joint-replacement surgery      earlier in life due to advances in surgery and devices. Since children begin      sports at a fairly early age, once they reach young adulthood, their joints have       sustained recurrent internal impact for many years leading to degeneration      earlier in life. These younger patients are expecting and choosing to participate      in sports even after surgery. They want to be able to coach and play sports with       their children without pain. While pain relief has historically been the main      reason people have joint replacement surgery--the need to improve joint-function       has also become motivating for patients--especially those involved in athletic      activities. Patients and orthopedic surgeons do not necessarily worry about the      same things after joint-replacement surgery.FAU - Lahav, AmitAU  - Lahav AAD  - OrthopedicHealth, LLC, Milford, USA.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Conn MedJT  - Connecticut medicineJID - 0372745SB  - IMMH  - *Arthroplasty, Replacement, KneeMH  - HumansMH  - *OsteotomyMH  - Recovery of FunctionMH  - *SportsMH  - Tibia/*surgeryEDAT- 2012/10/16 06:00MHDA- 2012/11/02 06:00CRDT- 2012/10/16 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Conn Med. 2012 Sep;76(8):483-5.PMID- 23060851OWN - NLMSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINEDA  - 20121012DCOM- 20121015LR  - 20130813IS  - 1664-2295 (Electronic)IS  - 1664-2295 (Linking)VI  - 3DP  - 2012TI  - High school coaches perceptions of physicians' role in the assessment and      management of sports-related concussive injury.PG  - 130LID - 10.3389/fneur.2012.00130 [doi]AB  - Sports concussions are an increasingly recognized common type of mild traumatic      brain injury (TBI) that affect athletes of all ages. The need for an increased      involvement of trained physicians in the diagnosis and treatment of concussion      has become more obvious as the pathophysiology and long-term sequelae of sports      concussion are better understood. To date, there has been great variability in      the athletic community about the recognition of symptoms, diagnosis, management,       and physician role in concussion care. An awareness assessment survey      administered to 96 high school coaches in a large metropolitan city demonstrated       that 37.5% of responders refer their concussed players to an emergency department      after the incident, only 39.5% of responders have a physician available to      evaluate their players after a concussion, 71.6% of those who had a physician      available sent their players to a sports medicine physician, and none of the      responders had their player's concussion evaluated by a neurologist.      Interestingly, 71.8% of responders stated that their players returned to the team      with "return to play" guidelines from their physician. This survey has      highlighted two important areas where the medical community can better serve the       athletic community. Because a concussion is a sport-inflicted injury to the      nervous system, it is optimally evaluated and managed by a clinician with      relevant training in both clinical neuroscience and sports medicine. Furthermore,      all physicians who see patients suffering concussion should be educated in the      current recommendations from the Consensus Statement on Concussion and provide      return to play instructions that outline a graduated return to play, allowing the      athlete to return to the field safely.FAU - Williams, NolanAU  - Williams NAD  - Department of Neurology, Medical University of South Carolina Charleston, SC,      USA.FAU - Sas, AndrewAU  - Sas AFAU - Madey, JayAU  - Madey JFAU - Bodle, JeffAU  - Bodle JFAU - Scovel, LaurenAU  - Scovel LFAU - Edwards, JonathanAU  - Edwards JLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20121005PL  - SwitzerlandTA  - Front NeurolJT  - Frontiers in neurologyJID - 101546899PMC - PMC3464423OID - NLM: PMC3464423OTO - NOTNLMOT  - athleteOT  - concussionOT  - neurologyOT  - sportsEDAT- 2012/10/13 06:00MHDA- 2012/10/13 06:01CRDT- 2012/10/13 06:00PHST- 2012/01/17 [received]PHST- 2012/08/09 [accepted]PHST- 2012/10/05 [epublish]AID - 10.3389/fneur.2012.00130 [doi]PST - epublishSO  - Front Neurol. 2012 Oct 5;3:130. doi: 10.3389/fneur.2012.00130. eCollection 2012.PMID- 23042252OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20121113DCOM- 20130604IS  - 1531-698X (Electronic)IS  - 1040-8703 (Linking)VI  - 24IP  - 6DP  - 2012 DecTI  - Epidemiology, trends, assessment and management of sport-related concussion in      United States high schools.PG  - 696-701LID - 10.1097/MOP.0b013e3283595175 [doi]AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sport-related concussion affects athletes at every level of      participation. The short and long-term effects of concussions that occur during      childhood and adolescence are not fully understood. The purpose of this review is      to describe the current burden of disease, current practice patterns and current       recommendations for the assessment and management of sport-related concussions      sustained by United States high school athletes. RECENT FINDINGS: Millions of      high school students participate in organized sports in the United States.      Current estimates suggest that, across all sports, approximately 2.5 concussions       occur for every 10 000 athletic exposures, in which an athletic exposure is      defined as one athlete participating in one game or practice. At schools that      employ at least one athletic trainer, most high school athletes who sustain      sport-related concussions will be cared for by athletic trainers and primary care      physicians. Approximately 40% will undergo computerized neurocognitive      assessment. SUMMARY: The number of high school athletes being diagnosed with      sport-related concussions is rising. American football has the highest number of       concussions in high school with girls' soccer having the second highest total      number. Fortunately, coaches are becoming increasingly aware of these injuries      and return-to-play guidelines are being implemented.FAU - Guerriero, Rejean MAU  - Guerriero RMAD  - Brain Injury Center, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston,       Massachusetts, USA.FAU - Proctor, Mark RAU  - Proctor MRFAU - Mannix, RebekahAU  - Mannix RFAU - Meehan, William P 3rdAU  - Meehan WP 3rdLA  - engGR  - T32 HD040128-06A1/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Curr Opin PediatrJT  - Current opinion in pediatricsJID - 9000850SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Athletic Injuries/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*therapyMH  - Brain Concussion/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*therapyMH  - HumansMH  - StudentsMH  - United States/epidemiologyEDAT- 2012/10/09 06:00MHDA- 2013/06/05 06:00CRDT- 2012/10/09 06:00AID - 10.1097/MOP.0b013e3283595175 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Curr Opin Pediatr. 2012 Dec;24(6):696-701. doi: 10.1097/MOP.0b013e3283595175.PMID- 23027233OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20121002DCOM- 20130312IS  - 1543-2904 (Electronic)IS  - 0895-2779 (Linking)VI  - 34IP  - 5DP  - 2012 OctTI  - Transcontextual development of motivation in sport injury prevention among elite       athletes.PG  - 661-82AB  - The present study investigated the transcontextual process of motivation in sport      injury prevention. We examined whether general causality orientation, perceived      autonomy support from coaches (PAS), self-determined motivation (SD-Mtv), and      basic need satisfaction in a sport context predicted SD-Mtv, beliefs, and      adherence with respect to sport injury prevention. Elite athletes (N = 533)      completed self-report measures of the predictors (Week 1) and the dependent      variables (Week 2). Variance-based structural equation modeling supported      hypotheses: SD-Mtv in a sport context was significantly predicted by PAS and      basic need satisfaction and was positively associated with SD-Mtv for sport      injury prevention when controlling for general causality orientation. SD-Mtv for       sport injury prevention was a significant predictor of adherence to      injury-preventive behaviors and beliefs regarding safety in sport. In conclusion,      the transcontextual mechanism of motivation may explain the process by which      distal motivational factors in sport direct the formation of proximal motivation,      beliefs, and behaviors of sport injury prevention.FAU - Chan, Derwin King ChungAU  - Chan DKAD  - School of Psychology and Speech Pathology, Curtin University, Perth, Australia.FAU - Hagger, Martin SAU  - Hagger MSLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Sport Exerc PsycholJT  - Journal of sport & exercise psychologyJID - 8809258SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Athletes/*psychologyMH  - Athletic Injuries/*prevention & control/psychologyMH  - ChinaMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Models, StatisticalMH  - *MotivationMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Risk Reduction BehaviorMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2012/10/03 06:00MHDA- 2013/03/13 06:00CRDT- 2012/10/03 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Sport Exerc Psychol. 2012 Oct;34(5):661-82.PMID- 23016800OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20121121DCOM- 20130425IS  - 1466-447X (Electronic)IS  - 0264-0414 (Linking)VI  - 30IP  - 15DP  - 2012TI  - Coach behaviours and practice structures in youth soccer: implications for talent      development.PG  - 1631-41LID - 10.1080/02640414.2012.721930 [doi]AB  - Coaches are central to talent development in youth soccer and what they say and      do impacts on players' achievements and well-being. Researchers have      systematically observed coach behaviour and practice activities within this      setting (i.e. 'what coaches do'). We review this research in light of      contemporary discussion that highlights a potential 'theory-practice' divide. Our      main example focuses on the discrepancy between coaching behaviour and research      from the sports science sub-discipline areas of motor learning and skill      acquisition that relate to how best to design practice sessions and provide      instruction (i.e., 'what coaches should probably do'). The underlying reasons for      this discrepancy are discussed and recommendations made to address this disparity      in research, education and coach behaviours.FAU - Cushion, ChrisAU  - Cushion CAD  - Sport and Exercise Science, Loughborough University, Loughborough, UK.

The possibility of changing this      approach has not yet been investigated. STUDY DESIGN: Case series. HYPOTHESIS: A       specific rehabilitation protocol for soccer players, with direct control of the      last on-field rehabilitation phases, may lead to complete functional recovery.      METHODS: Fifty competitive soccer players who followed a sport-specific      rehabilitation protocol for soccer were evaluated during the recovery period      until their return to competition. The assessment of the functional outcomes was       performed using the Knee Outcome Survey-Sports Activity Scale and isokinetic and       aerobic fitness tests. RESULTS: The average start of on-field rehabilitation was       90 +/- 26 days after surgery; the average time to return to the competitions was       185 +/- 52 days. The improvement in the Knee Outcome Survey-Sports Activity Scale      during on-field rehabilitation was significant (P < 0.01; from 79 +/- 15% to 96      +/- 7%). The isokinetic and aerobic fitness tests showed a significant      improvement of muscle strength (knee extensors, +55%, P < 0.01; knee flexors,      +86%, P < 0.01) and aerobic threshold (+23%, P < 0.01) from the beginning to the       end of on-field rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: Adding on-field rehabilitation to      the traditional protocols after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction may      safely lead to complete functional recovery in soccer players.FAU - Della Villa, StefanoAU  - Della Villa SAD  - Education Research Department, Isokinetic Medical Group, Bologna, Italy.FAU - Boldrini, LorenzoAU  - Boldrini LFAU - Ricci, MargheritaAU  - Ricci MFAU - Danelon, FurioAU  - Danelon FFAU - Snyder-Mackler, LynnAU  - Snyder-Mackler LFAU - Nanni, GianniAU  - Nanni GFAU - Roi, Giulio SergioAU  - Roi GSLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Sports HealthJT  - Sports healthJID - 101518422PMC - PMC3435892OID - NLM: PMC3435892OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Anterior Cruciate Ligament reconstructionOT  - clinical outcomesOT  - on-field rehabilitationOT  - return to sportEDAT- 2012/09/28 06:00MHDA- 2012/09/28 06:01CRDT- 2012/09/28 06:00AID - 10.1177/1941738111417564 [doi]AID - 10.1177_1941738111417564 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Sports Health. 2012 Jan;4(1):17-24.PMID- 23007365OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20120925DCOM- 20121203IS  - 0807-7096 (Electronic)IS  - 0029-2001 (Linking)VI  - 132IP  - 17DP  - 2012 Sep 18TI  - [What is sports psychiatry?].PG  - 1974-6FAU - Skarderud, FinnAU  - Skarderud FAD  - Institutt for spesialpedagogikk, Universitetet i Oslo, Norway. finns@online.noLA  - norPT  - Journal ArticleTT  - Hva er idrettspsykiatri?PL  - NorwayTA  - Tidsskr Nor LaegeforenJT  - Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny      raekkeJID - 0413423SB  - IMMH  - Athletes/*psychologyMH  - HumansMH  - Mental Disorders/*therapyMH  - Mental HealthMH  - Psychiatry/*methodsMH  - Sports/*psychologyEDAT- 2012/09/26 06:00MHDA- 2012/12/10 06:00CRDT- 2012/09/26 06:00AID - 2863673 [pii]AID - 10.4045/tidsskr.12.0433 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen. 2012 Sep 18;132(17):1974-6.PMID- 22994791OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20130411DCOM- 20130930IS  - 1365-2265 (Electronic)IS  - 0300-0664 (Linking)VI  - 78IP  - 5DP  - 2013 MayTI  - Growth hormone deficiency due to sports-related head trauma is associated with      impaired cognitive performance in amateur boxers and kickboxers as revealed by      P300 auditory event-related potentials.PG  - 730-7LID - 10.1111/cen.12037 [doi]AB  - OBJECTIVES: It has been recently reported that boxing and kickboxing may cause      pituitary dysfunction, GH deficiency in particular. The strong link between poor       cognitive performance and GH deficiency due to causes other than head trauma and       the improvement of cognitive function after GH replacement therapy have been      previously shown. P300 auditory event-related potential (ERP) measure is widely      used to evaluate cognitive performance. In this study, we investigated the      relation between the GH-IGF-I axis and cognitive performance in boxers and      kickboxers. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Forty-one actively competing or retired male      boxers (n: 27) and kickboxers (n: 14) with a mean age of 29.04 +/- 9.30 year and       14 age- and education-matched healthy male controls were included in the study.      For neuropsychological tests, the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and      Quality of Life Assessment of GH Deficiency in Adults (QoL-AGHDA) questionnaires       were administered. Moreover, cognitive performance was evaluated according to      P300 ERPs. RESULTS: Nine of 41 (21.9%) athletes had GH deficiency. P300      amplitudes were lower at all electrode sites in the GH-deficient group than in      controls, and the differences were statistically significant at Fz and Oz      electrode sites (P < 0.05). When GH-deficient athletes were compared with      GH-sufficient athletes, the P300 amplitudes were lower at all electrode sites in       the GH-deficient group; these differences were statistically significant at Fz,      Pz and Cz electrode sites (P < 0.05). In all athletes, there were significant      negative correlations between IGF-I levels vs P300 latencies, and there were      significant positive correlations between IGF-I levels vs P300 amplitudes (P <      0.05). CONCLUSION: This study provides the first electrophysiological evidence      for the close relation between the P300 ERPs and the GH-IGF-I axis in boxers and       kickboxers.CI  - (c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.FAU - Tanriverdi, FatihAU  - Tanriverdi FAD  - Department of Endocrinology, Erciyes University Medical School, Kayseri, Turkey.       fatihtan@erciyes.edu.trFAU - Suer, CemAU  - Suer CFAU - Yapislar, HandeAU  - Yapislar HFAU - Kocyigit, IsmailAU  - Kocyigit IFAU - Selcuklu, AhmetAU  - Selcuklu AFAU - Unluhizarci, KursadAU  - Unluhizarci KFAU - Casanueva, Felipe FAU  - Casanueva FFFAU - Kelestimur, FahrettinAU  - Kelestimur FLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - EnglandTA  - Clin Endocrinol (Oxf)JT  - Clinical endocrinologyJID - 0346653RN  - 12629-01-5 (Human Growth Hormone)SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - *BoxingMH  - Case-Control StudiesMH  - Cognition Disorders/*blood/*etiologyMH  - Craniocerebral Trauma/blood/*complicationsMH  - Event-Related Potentials, P300/*physiologyMH  - Human Growth Hormone/blood/*deficiencyMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - *SportsMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2012/09/22 06:00MHDA- 2013/10/01 06:00CRDT- 2012/09/22 06:00PHST- 2012/05/04 [received]PHST- 2012/08/18 [revised]PHST- 2012/08/31 [revised]PHST- 2012/08/31 [accepted]AID - 10.1111/cen.12037 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Clin Endocrinol (Oxf). 2013 May;78(5):730-7. doi: 10.1111/cen.12037.PMID- 22990571OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20130624DCOM- 20140326IS  - 1533-4287 (Electronic)IS  - 1064-8011 (Linking)VI  - 27IP  - 7DP  - 2013 JulTI  - A job analysis of major college female strength and conditioning coaches.PG  - 2000-12LID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e31827361a9 [doi]AB  - This investigation consisted of a job analysis of 6 National Collegiate Athletic       Association (NCAA) Division I female strength and conditioning coaches. Each      coach was employed at universities competing within the Football Bowl      Subdivision. All subjects in the survey were responsible for providing strength      and conditioning services to their institution's athletic programs. The      procedures used for the gathering of data involved a questionnaire followed by a       semi-structured interview. The purpose of this format was to use the      semi-structured interview to delve more deeply into the issues raised by the      questionnaire. Evidence was obtained related to demographic data; major job      duties; relationships with supervisors, fellow strength coaches, and the sport      coaches with whom they work; and the effects the job has on their spouse and      other family members. All the participants in the study were white with an      average age of 31.6 years. Their average time spent in the profession was 8      years, and the average time spent in their current employment was 5 years.      Overall, the job satisfaction for the group was high. Five of the subjects held      master's degrees, and all participants held relevant certifications in the field.      The coaches primarily provided services to athletes participating in women's      sports at their respective universities.FAU - Massey, C DwayneAU  - Massey CDAD  - School of Education, University of Arkansas at Monticello, Monticello, Arkansas,       USA. massey@uamont.eduFAU - Vincent, JohnAU  - Vincent JLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Strength Cond ResJT  - Journal of strength and conditioning research / National Strength & Conditioning       AssociationJID - 9415084SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - CertificationMH  - Educational StatusMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - Interviews as TopicMH  - *Job DescriptionMH  - *Job SatisfactionMH  - *Physical Education and TrainingMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - UniversitiesEDAT- 2012/09/20 06:00MHDA- 2014/03/29 06:00CRDT- 2012/09/20 06:00AID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e31827361a9 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Strength Cond Res. 2013 Jul;27(7):2000-12. doi: 10.1519/JSC.0b013e31827361a9.PMID- 22986445OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20130529DCOM- 20140325IS  - 1533-4287 (Electronic)IS  - 1064-8011 (Linking)VI  - 27IP  - 6DP  - 2013 JunTI  - Effect of high-speed treadmill training with a body weight support system in a      sport acceleration program with female soccer players.PG  - 1496-502LID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e31826cac04 [doi]AB  - Maximum running speed and acceleration are essential components in many sports.      The identification of specific training protocols to maximize sprint speed would       be useful knowledge for coaches and players. The purpose of this study was to      determine the effect of a high-speed treadmill (HST) with the use of a body      weight support (BWS) system in a 6-week sport acceleration program (SAP) on      female soccer athlete's 40-yard sprint time and maximal isometric knee flexor and      extensor strength. Two treatment groups and one control group were created. Both       treatment groups participated in a 12-session SAP. The first treatment group (n =      12) used a BWS system while running on a HST; the second group (n = 12) used a      standard treadmill (ST) with no BWS system. The participants of the control group      (n = 8), NT, did not participate in a sports acceleration program and did not      alter their exercise routines outside of the study. An analysis of covariance was      performed using baseline measures as the covariate. The 40-yard sprint times for       both treatment groups were shown to improve significantly compared with the      control group (p < 0.001). Isometric knee flexor strength showed a greater      increase in the ST group (p = 0.026) than in the other 2 groups, whereas knee      extensor strengths did not show significant differences between treatment groups       and control group (p > 0.05). Participants in the ST group had a much higher rate      (66%) of shin splints and foot pain throughout the study than those in the HST      (8%) and NT (0%) groups. These results can help high school coaches and athletes       determine the optimal treadmill training regime.FAU - Johnson, A WayneAU  - Johnson AWAD  - Department of Exercise Sciences, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah, USA.      wayne_johnson@byu.eduFAU - Eastman, Carie SAU  - Eastman CSFAU - Feland, Jeffery BrentAU  - Feland JBFAU - Mitchell, Ulrike HAU  - Mitchell UHFAU - Mortensen, Bartley BrettAU  - Mortensen BBFAU - Eggett, DennisAU  - Eggett DLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Randomized Controlled TrialPL  - United StatesTA  - J Strength Cond ResJT  - Journal of strength and conditioning research / National Strength & Conditioning       AssociationJID - 9415084SB  - IMMH  - AccelerationMH  - AdolescentMH  - Athletic Performance/physiologyMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - Isometric ContractionMH  - Leg/physiologyMH  - *Muscle StrengthMH  - Muscle, Skeletal/physiologyMH  - Physical Education and Training/*methodsMH  - Running/*physiologyMH  - Soccer/*physiologyEDAT- 2012/09/19 06:00MHDA- 2014/03/26 06:00CRDT- 2012/09/19 06:00AID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e31826cac04 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Strength Cond Res. 2013 Jun;27(6):1496-502. doi: 10.1519/JSC.0b013e31826cac04.PMID- 22974445OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20130110DCOM- 20130613IS  - 1600-0838 (Electronic)IS  - 0905-7188 (Linking)VI  - 23IP  - 1DP  - 2013 FebTI  - Can reputation biases influence the outcome and process of making competence      judgments of a coach?PG  - e65-73LID - 10.1111/sms.12000 [doi]AB  - The present studies explored the effect of reputational biases on judgments made       of coach competence and the visual search patterns adopted by individuals when      generating initial impressions and expectations of a target. In study 1,      participants (n = 326) observed footage of two coaches prior to making competence      judgments of them. All participants viewed similar footage for the first coach      (control) but reputational information was manipulated for the second coach      (target). In study 2, participants (n = 22) followed the same procedure as study       1 but also wore a head-mounted eye-tracking system to enable visual search data      to be collected. Study 1 broadly reported coaches with a "professional"      reputation to be judged as being significantly more competent across varying      competence measures compared to coaches with either an "in-training" reputation      or "no reputation." Study 2 indicated limited differences across the reputational      conditions in relation to visual fixations. The data indicate that expectations      of coach competence can be influenced, and largely controlled, by the      reputational information provided to athletes. While there were limited      differences in visual search strategies across reputation conditions, suggestions      for research are made to enable a fuller insight to the interpersonal      interactions that may facilitate the working association between athletes and      coaches.CI  - (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.FAU - Thelwell, R CAU  - Thelwell RCAD  - University of Portsmouth, Portsmouth, UK. richard.thelwell@port.ac.ukFAU - Page, J LAU  - Page JLFAU - Lush, AAU  - Lush AFAU - Greenlees, I AAU  - Greenlees IAFAU - Manley, A JAU  - Manley AJLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20120913PL  - DenmarkTA  - Scand J Med Sci SportsJT  - Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sportsJID - 9111504SB  - IMMH  - FemaleMH  - *Fixation, OcularMH  - HumansMH  - Interpersonal RelationsMH  - *JudgmentMH  - MaleMH  - *Physical Education and TrainingMH  - Prejudice/*psychologyMH  - *Professional CompetenceMH  - Sports/*educationMH  - Students/psychologyMH  - Videotape RecordingMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2012/09/15 06:00MHDA- 2013/06/14 06:00CRDT- 2012/09/15 06:00PHST- 2012/08/13 [accepted]PHST- 2012/09/13 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1111/sms.12000 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Scand J Med Sci Sports. 2013 Feb;23(1):e65-73. doi: 10.1111/sms.12000.

The purpose of this retrospective recall study was to      identify whether early specialisation or sporting diversification (sampling)      throughout childhood and adolescence can influence performance levels prior to      adulthood. An online questionnaire was used to collect the sport participation      histories of 1006 UK sports people, which were then compared with the      developmental framework provided by the Developmental Model of Sport      Participation (DMSP, Cote & Fraser-Thomas, 2007). A significant association      between the number of sports participated in at the ages of 11, 13, and 15 and      the standard of competition between 16 and 18 years was found. Individuals who      competed in three sports aged 11, 13, and 15 were significantly more likely to      compete at a national compared with club standard between the ages of 16 and 18      than those who practised only one sport.

A total of 150 sport performers from      football teams across a range of competitive levels completed a multisection      self-report instrument to assess their individual perceptions of the level of      collective efficacy, the type of coach leadership, and the quality of the      coach-athlete relationship. Multiple regression analyses revealed that      perceptions of both coach leadership and the coach-athlete relationship predicted      variance in team efficacy. Overall, the findings suggest that the quality of      coach-athlete relationships added to the prediction of individuals' collective      efficacy beyond what was predicted by coaches' behaviors of leadership alone.

Optimal treatment of ACL injury      requires individualised management. Patient selection is of utmost importance,      and so is respect for the patient's functional demands and interests. All      patients with an ACL tear may not need surgery, however athletes and persons with      an active lifestyle with high knee functional demands including cutting motions      need and should be offered surgery. In many cases it may not be the choice of      graft or technique that is the key for success, but the choice of surgeon. The      surgeon should be experienced and use a reconstructive procedure he/she knows      very well and is comfortable with. The development of osteoarthritis after an ACL      injury depends very much on the injury mechanism and concurrent meniscal injury,       as knee articular cartilage continues to heal for 1-2 years after an ACL injury.       Therefore the surgeon and rehabilitation team must pay attention to the      rehabilitation process and to the decision when to return to sport. Return to      sport must be carefully considered, as top-level sport in itself is one main risk      factor for osteoarthritis after ACL injury. The present criteria for return to      sport need to be revisited, also due to the fact that recurrent injury seems to      be an increasing problem. ACL injury prevention programmes are now available in      some sports. The key issue for a prevention programme to be successful is proper       implementation. Vital factors for success include the individual coaching of the       player and well controlled compliance with the training programme. Preventive      activities should be more actively supported by the involved athletic community.       Despite substantial advances in the field of ACL injury over the past 40 years,      substantial management challenges remain.FAU - Renstrom, Per AAU  - Renstrom PAAD  - Section of Orthopedics and Sports Medicine, Department of Molecular Medicine and       Surgery, Stockholm Center for Sports Trauma Research, Karolinska Institutet,      Stockholm, Sweden. per.renstrom@telia.comLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20120831PL  - EnglandTA  - Br J Sports MedJT  - British journal of sports medicineJID - 0432520SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - Anterior Cruciate Ligament/*injuries/surgeryMH  - Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction/methodsMH  - Athletic Injuries/diagnosis/*etiology/rehabilitationMH  - Biomechanical PhenomenaMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Osteoarthritis, Knee/etiologyMH  - Postoperative Complications/etiologyMH  - Recovery of FunctionMH  - Rupture/etiologyMH  - Time-to-TreatmentMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2012/09/04 06:00MHDA- 2013/09/14 06:00CRDT- 2012/09/04 06:00PHST- 2012/08/31 [aheadofprint]AID - bjsports-2012-091623 [pii]AID - 10.1136/bjsports-2012-091623 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Br J Sports Med. 2013 Apr;47(6):367-72. doi: 10.1136/bjsports-2012-091623.

This problem addresses      particularly to sportsmen and physically active persons. It is often due to      belief that customary diet does not supply organism with necessary food      ingredients. There are also some threats connected with supplementation of the      diet. Problems addressed to supplementation of the diet are particularly      important for young sportsmen, including students of sport mastery schools.      OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was the evaluation of the diet supplementation      used by the students of sport mastery school in Western Pomeranian district.      MATERIAL AND METHOD: The study was carried out in the group of 76 students, aged       15 to 19, practicing walleyball (girls n = 39) and football (boys n = 37) at the       sport mastery school in Police (western Pomeranian district). The interview      method has been applied. A significance of differences, for the analysed factor,       due to a sport discipline practiced was calculated based on Chi2 (Statistica 9).       RESULTS: The results of the study confirmed the students of sport mastery school       to supplement their diets. The diet supplementation being more frequent for boys       (67.6%) with magnesium (57-64%) noted as the most frequently used supplement,      followed with vitamin-mineral agents and L-carnitine. Essential differences were       noted for reasons of diet supplementation and sources of information used on      supplements between the sport disciplines practiced. CONCLUSIONS: It can be      stated, based on the obtained results, that for supplementation of the diet among      students of sport mastery school in Police is popular, even though there was no      previous recognition of its necessity. The most frequent supplements users were      football players with magnesium being the most frequently chosen supplement.      Based on the above a regular training of sportsmen, including also coaches      training young people, on the rational feeding habits would be advisable.FAU - Seidler, TeresaAU  - Seidler TAD  - Wydzial Nauk o Zywnosci i Rybactwa Zachodniopomorski Uniwersytet Technologiczny w      Szczecinie. teresa.seidler@zut.edu.plFAU - Sobczak, AnnaAU  - Sobczak ALA  - polPT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticleTT  - Suplementy diety w zywieniu uczniow szkoly mistrzostwa sportowego.PL  - PolandTA  - Rocz Panstw Zakl HigJT  - Roczniki Panstwowego Zakladu HigienyJID - 0414756SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Dietary Supplements/*utilizationMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Nutritional StatusMH  - PolandMH  - Sex FactorsMH  - Sports/*physiologyMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2012/08/30 06:00MHDA- 2012/09/21 06:00CRDT- 2012/08/30 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Rocz Panstw Zakl Hig. 2012;63(2):193-8.PMID- 22925166OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20121106DCOM- 20130515IS  - 1600-0838 (Electronic)IS  - 0905-7188 (Linking)VI  - 22IP  - 6DP  - 2012 DecTI  - Coaching communication issues with elite female athletes: two Norwegian case      studies.PG  - e156-67LID - 10.1111/j.1600-0838.2012.01521.x [doi]AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the careers of two successful female elite      athletes who later stagnated, and to identify possible factors that might have      led to their demotivation. Individual interviews and a focus group interview were      conducted. Using a multidisciplinary approach, the stories of April and Hazel      raised several issues related to coaching, coach education, and the development      of female athletes. Their individual profiles revealed that their perception of      the lack of long-term development was caused by coach miscommunication, having to      cope with sudden fame, and injuries provoked by overtraining. The coach-athlete      relationship was discussed with a focus on the inexperience of some coaches, the       number of coaches the athletes had to deal with, sociolinguistic issues, and the       differing criteria of success communicated. Finally, the importance of their      national governing bodies to focus on knowledge transfer, the supervision of      coaches, and the infrastructure to monitor athletes were discussed.CI  - (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.FAU - Kristiansen, EAU  - Kristiansen EAD  - Norwegian School of Sport Sciences, Oslo, Norway. elsa.kristiansen@nih.noFAU - Tomten, S EAU  - Tomten SEFAU - Hanstad, D VAU  - Hanstad DVFAU - Roberts, G CAU  - Roberts GCLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20120827PL  - DenmarkTA  - Scand J Med Sci SportsJT  - Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sportsJID - 9111504SB  - IMMH  - Adaptation, PsychologicalMH  - AdultMH  - Athletes/*psychologyMH  - Athletic Injuries/etiologyMH  - *CommunicationMH  - ExerciseMH  - FemaleMH  - Health Knowledge, Attitudes, PracticeMH  - HumansMH  - *Interpersonal RelationsMH  - Interviews as TopicMH  - MotivationMH  - NorwayMH  - Organizational PolicyMH  - Sports/education/psychology/standardsMH  - Stress, Psychological/*psychologyEDAT- 2012/08/29 06:00MHDA- 2013/05/17 06:00CRDT- 2012/08/29 06:00PHST- 2012/07/02 [accepted]PHST- 2012/08/27 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1111/j.1600-0838.2012.01521.x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Scand J Med Sci Sports. 2012 Dec;22(6):e156-67. doi:      10.1111/j.1600-0838.2012.01521.x.

OBJECTIVES: To determine if sports activities have been detrimental       in improving functional ability in sample of children with mental retardation      based in Kolkata, a metropolis in India. STUDY DESIGN: Field level study.      METHODS: Six sports associations registered under the Sports Authority of India      for training children with mental retardation were shortlisted on the basis of      four criteria. From the register, every third name (gender irrespective)      belonging to the second (12-15 years) and third (15-21 years) subclasses (out of       the four categories laid down in the Special Olympics participation rules)      against a constraint of at least two years active attendance in the sports      facility for the child was selected. A sample of 31 children was drawn and the      WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0) 12-item version was      administered to the caregiver-teacher-coach team of the sample. Relative changes       in scores between the point when the survey was conducted and the point when the       child joined the sports facility was used as the dependent variable for      regression analysis. The number of years in active sports, in school age of the      respondent and base score of the children when they joined school were the      independent variables. RESULTS: For seven of the WHODAS 2.0 12-item attributes,      the number of years in sports activities was found to have a statistically      significant effect (p < 0.01) on the functional well being of children with mild       to moderate mental retardation. The number of years in school was also another      statistically significant factor (p < 0.01) responsible for this improvement. The      children, however, perceived of being not welcome in community activities, but      participated in activities meant exclusively for them. CONCLUSIONS: This small      study showed that the proposition that number of years in sports activities was a      significant factor responsible for improving the functioning of children with      mild to moderate mental retardation.FAU - Ghosh, DipanwitaAU  - Ghosh DAD  - HMM College, Kolkata, India.FAU - Datta, Tarit KAU  - Datta TKLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - EnglandTA  - Prosthet Orthot IntJT  - Prosthetics and orthotics internationalJID - 7707720SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - ChildMH  - *Developing CountriesMH  - Disability EvaluationMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - IndiaMH  - Intellectual Disability/*physiopathologyMH  - MaleMH  - Motor Activity/*physiologyMH  - Regression AnalysisMH  - Research ReportMH  - *Social ParticipationMH  - *SportsMH  - World Health OrganizationMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2012/08/25 06:00MHDA- 2013/04/03 06:00CRDT- 2012/08/25 06:00AID - 36/3/339 [pii]AID - 10.1177/0309364612451206 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Prosthet Orthot Int. 2012 Sep;36(3):339-47. doi: 10.1177/0309364612451206.PMID- 22918903OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20120824DCOM- 20130402IS  - 1746-1553 (Electronic)IS  - 0309-3646 (Linking)VI  - 36IP  - 3DP  - 2012 SepTI  - Should preparation for elite sporting participation be included in the      rehabilitation process of war-injured veterans?PG  - 270-7LID - 10.1177/0309364612447096 [doi]AB  - BACKGROUND: Participation in sport and exercise training, while aiding in the      reintegration and confidence building of wounded service personnel, also has      potential to prepare them for elite sport competition. It is this encouragement      of the war injured to use sport and recreational physical activity as a means of       rehabilitation back into civilian life, which has become the worldwide phenomenon      of Paralympic sport. OBJECTIVES: This paper evaluates existing research relating       to the incidence of types of war injuries and the use of sport within the      rehabilitation process. STUDY DESIGN: Literature review. METHODS: Initial      searches were conducted in the electronic databases EBSCOHost, ScienceDirect and       Pubmed using the keywords 'veterans' and 'sport' or 'physical activity'. These      searches were then supplemented by tracking all key references from the      appropriate articles identified. A narrative literature review methodology was      employed. RESULTS: Although it is clear from the reported literature that further      development of available rehabilitation services is necessary to provide the      required level of care for the types of mental and physical injuries and the      concept of 'therapeutic recreation' is becoming popular, there is still a need      for the development of specific protocols to identify individuals who can      participate and excel in a specific sport at an elite level. CONCLUSIONS: Drawing      on the US military experience it can be argued that sport in the UK and other      parts of the world should be more widely recognized as a component of      rehabilitation. This is not just for the role that sport can play as a tool for      rehabilitation but also for the intrinsic and extrinsic benefits that      participation in elite sport can offer.FAU - Chockalingam, NachiappanAU  - Chockalingam NAD  - Staffordshire University, Stoke on Trent, UK. n.chockalingam@staffs.ac.ukFAU - Thomas, Nigel BAU  - Thomas NBFAU - Duval, LynneAU  - Duval LLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - EnglandTA  - Prosthet Orthot IntJT  - Prosthetics and orthotics internationalJID - 7707720SB  - IMMH  - Amputees/psychology/*rehabilitationMH  - HumansMH  - IncidenceMH  - Motor ActivityMH  - Prostheses and ImplantsMH  - Social Participation/*psychologyMH  - Sports/*psychologyMH  - Veterans/*psychologyMH  - *WarMH  - Wounds and Injuries/epidemiology/psychology/*rehabilitationEDAT- 2012/08/25 06:00MHDA- 2013/04/03 06:00CRDT- 2012/08/25 06:00AID - 36/3/270 [pii]AID - 10.1177/0309364612447096 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Prosthet Orthot Int. 2012 Sep;36(3):270-7. doi: 10.1177/0309364612447096.PMID- 22909185OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20120822DCOM- 20130226LR  - 20131121IS  - 1179-2035 (Electronic)IS  - 0112-1642 (Linking)VI  - 42IP  - 9DP  - 2012 Sep 1TI  - Which screening tools can predict injury to the lower extremities in team      sports?: a systematic review.PG  - 791-815LID - 10.2165/11632730-000000000-00000 [doi]AB  - BACKGROUND: Injuries to lower extremities are common in team sports such as      soccer, basketball, volleyball, football and field hockey. Considering personal      grief, disabling consequences and high costs caused by injuries to lower      extremities, the importance for the prevention of these injuries is evident. From      this point of view it is important to know which screening tools can identify      athletes who are at risk of injury to their lower extremities. OBJECTIVE: The aim      of this article is to determine the predictive values of anthropometric and/or      physical screening tests for injuries to the leg, anterior cruciate ligament      (ACL), knee, hamstring, groin and ankle in team sports. METHODS: A systematic      review was conducted in MEDLINE (1966 to September 2011), EMBASE (1989 to      September 2011) and CINAHL (1982 to September 2011). Based on inclusion criteria       defined a priori, titles, abstracts and full texts were analysed to find relevant      studies. RESULTS: The analysis showed that different screening tools can be      predictive for injuries to the knee, ACL, hamstring, groin and ankle. For      injuries in general there is some support in the literature to suggest that      general joint laxity is a predictive measure for leg injuries. The anterior      right/left reach distance >4 cm and the composite reach distance <4.0% of limb      length in girls measured with the star excursion balance test (SEBT) may predict       leg injuries. Furthermore, an increasing age, a lower hamstring/quadriceps (H :      Q) ratio and a decreased range of motion (ROM) of hip abduction may predict the      occurrence of leg injuries. Hyperextension of the knee, side-to-side differences       in anterior-posterior knee laxity and differences in knee abduction moment      between both legs are suggested to be predictive tests for sustaining an ACL      injury and height was a predictive screening tool for knee ligament injuries.      There is some evidence that when age increases, the probability of sustaining a      hamstring injury increases. Debate exists in the analysed literature regarding      measurement of the flexibility of the hamstring as a predictive screening tool,      as well as using the H : Q ratio. Hip-adduction-to-abduction strength is a      predictive test for hip adductor muscle strain. Studies do not agree on whether      ROM of the hamstring is a predictive screening tool for groin injury. Body mass      index and the age of an athlete could contribute to an ankle sprain. There is      support in the literature to suggest that greater strength of the plantar flexors      may be a predictive measure for sustaining an ankle injury. Furthermore, there is      some agreement that the measurement of postural sway is a predictive test for an       ankle injury. CONCLUSIONS: The screening tools mentioned above can be recommended      to medical staff and coaches for screening their athletes. Future research should      focus on prospective studies in larger groups and should follow athletes over      several seasons.FAU - Dallinga, Joan MAU  - Dallinga JMAD  - Center for Human Movement Sciences, University Medical Center Groningen,      University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.FAU - Benjaminse, AnneAU  - Benjaminse AFAU - Lemmink, Koen A P MAU  - Lemmink KALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - New ZealandTA  - Sports MedJT  - Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)JID - 8412297SB  - IMMH  - *AnthropometryMH  - Athletic Injuries/*etiologyMH  - Biomechanical PhenomenaMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - Lower Extremity/*injuriesMH  - MaleMH  - Mass Screening/*methodsMH  - Predictive Value of TestsMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - SportsEDAT- 2012/08/23 06:00MHDA- 2013/02/27 06:00CRDT- 2012/08/23 06:00AID - 2 [pii]AID - 10.2165/11632730-000000000-00000 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Sports Med. 2012 Sep 1;42(9):791-815. doi: 10.2165/11632730-000000000-00000.PMID- 22906781OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20120821DCOM- 20121214IS  - 1473-0480 (Electronic)IS  - 0306-3674 (Linking)VI  - 46IP  - 11DP  - 2012 SepTI  - Health and performance challenges during sports training and competition in cold       weather.PG  - 788-91LID - 10.1136/bjsports-2012-091260 [doi]AB  - Olympic athletes compete and train in diverse cold-weather environments,      generally without adverse effects.

That core team is often supplemented by      nurses, psychotherapists, coaches, teachers, the athletic director, and, of      course, family members. However, access to such a model is frequently limited by       financial, geographical, and numerous other factors. In the absence of such      resources, a thorough clinical evaluation and management by an available, ongoing      healthcare provider, quite often the sports physical therapist, becomes      necessary.The authors recommend that the professional who coordinates the      athlete's post-concussion healthcare should focus efforts upon a comprehensive      assessment and tailored treatment plan specific to the athlete's post-concussive       symptoms. Assessment of both pre-morbid function and post-injury physical,      cognitive, psychosocial, emotional, and behavioral issues, including the      patient's support system, can assist the clinician with identifying specific      constraints to sport, academic, social, and vocational activity participation.      Hence, the assessment provides structure to the athlete's individualized      treatment plan. Successful specialized interventions that address the      multi-faceted impairments of sport related concussion frequently require      knowledge of resources in a variety of other healthcare professions, in order to       facilitate appropriate and necessary treatment referrals.Initial assessment      should be followed by repeat monitoring throughout treatment, and spanning a      variety of environments, in order to ensure the athlete's full recovery prior to       return, not only to sport participation, but also to involvement in social,      academic, and/or employment related life activities.

Controlling for      socially desirable responses, structural equation modeling revealed that greater       job security and opportunities for professional development, and lower work-life       conflict were associated with psychological need satisfaction, which, in turn,      was related to an adaptive process of psychological well-being and perceived      autonomy support toward athletes. In contrast, higher work-life conflict and      fewer opportunities for development were associated with a distinct maladaptive      process of thwarted psychological needs, psychological ill-being, and perceived      controlling interpersonal behavior. The results highlight how the coaching      context may impact upon coaches' psychological health and their interpersonal      behavior toward athletes. Moreover, evidence is provided for the independence of       adaptive and maladaptive processes within the self-determination theory paradigm.FAU - Stebbings, JulietteAU  - Stebbings JAD  - School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences, Loughborough University,      Leicestershire, UK.FAU - Taylor, Ian MAU  - Taylor IMFAU - Spray, Christopher MAU  - Spray CMFAU - Ntoumanis, NikosAU  - Ntoumanis NLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Sport Exerc PsycholJT  - Journal of sport & exercise psychologyJID - 8809258SB  - IMMH  - *Adaptation, PsychologicalMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Cross-Sectional StudiesMH  - Employment/psychologyMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - *Interpersonal RelationsMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Personal AutonomyMH  - Personal SatisfactionMH  - Psychological TestsMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Sports/*psychologyMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2012/08/15 06:00MHDA- 2013/01/08 06:00CRDT- 2012/08/15 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Sport Exerc Psychol. 2012 Aug;34(4):481-502.PMID- 22868795OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20120807DCOM- 20130314IS  - 1434-6621 (Print)IS  - 1434-6621 (Linking)VI  - 50IP  - 8DP  - 2012 AugTI  - Laboratory medicine and sports: between Scylla and Charybdis.PG  - 1309-16LID - 10.1515/cclm-2012-0062 [doi]LID - /j/cclm.2012.50.issue-8/cclm-2012-0062/cclm-2012-0062.xml [pii]AB  - Laboratory medicine is complex and contributes to the diagnosis, therapeutic      monitoring and follow-up of acquired and inherited human disorders. The regular      practice of physical exercise provides important benefits in heath and disease      and sports medicine is thereby receiving growing focus from almost each and every      clinical discipline, including laboratory medicine. Sport-laboratory medicine is       a relatively innovative branch of laboratory science, which can provide valuable       contributions to the diagnosis and follow-up of athletic injuries, and which is      acquiring a growing clinical significance to support biomechanics and identify      novel genomics and "exercisenomics" patterns that can help identify specific      athlete's tendency towards certain types of sport traumas and injuries.      Laboratory medicine can also provide sport physicians and coaches with valuable      clues about personal inclination towards a certain sport, health status, fitness       and nutritional deficiencies of professional, elite and recreational athletes in       order to enable a better and earlier prediction of sport injuries, overreaching      and overtraining. Finally, the wide armamentarium of laboratory tests represents       the milestone for identifying cheating athletes in the strenuous fight against      doping in sports.FAU - Lippi, GiuseppeAU  - Lippi GAD  - U.O. di Diagnostica Ematochimica, Dipartimento di Patologia e Medicina di      Laboratorio, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Parma, Parma, Italy.      giuseppe.lippi@univr.itFAU - Banfi, GiuseppeAU  - Banfi GFAU - Botre, FrancescoAU  - Botre FFAU - de la Torre, XavierAU  - de la Torre XFAU - De Vita, FrancescoAU  - De Vita FFAU - Gomez-Cabrera, Mari CarmenAU  - Gomez-Cabrera MCFAU - Maffulli, NicolaAU  - Maffulli NFAU - Marchioro, LucioAU  - Marchioro LFAU - Pacifici, RobertaAU  - Pacifici RFAU - Sanchis-Gomar, FabianAU  - Sanchis-Gomar FFAU - Schena, FedericoAU  - Schena FFAU - Plebani, MarioAU  - Plebani MLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20120228PL  - GermanyTA  - Clin Chem Lab MedJT  - Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine : CCLM / FESCCJID - 9806306SB  - IMMH  - Doping in SportsMH  - *ExerciseMH  - HumansMH  - Medical Laboratory Science/*methodsMH  - *SportsMH  - Sports Medicine/*methodsEDAT- 2012/08/08 06:00MHDA- 2013/03/15 06:00CRDT- 2012/08/08 06:00PHST- 2012/01/31 [received]PHST- 2012/02/06 [accepted]AID - 10.1515/cclm-2012-0062 [doi]AID - /j/cclm.2012.50.issue-8/cclm-2012-0062/cclm-2012-0062.xml [pii]PST - epublishSO  - Clin Chem Lab Med. 2012 Feb 28;50(8):1309-16. doi: 10.1515/cclm-2012-0062.PMID- 22868280OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20121130DCOM- 20130123IS  - 1555-0265 (Print)IS  - 1555-0265 (Linking)VI  - 7IP  - 4DP  - 2012 DecTI  - Talent identification and specialization in sport: an overview of some unanswered      questions.PG  - 390-3AB  - The theory of deliberate practice postulates that experts are always made, not      born. This theory translated to the youth-sport domain means that if athletes      want to be high-level performers, they need to deliberately engage in practice      during the specialization years, spending time wisely and always focusing on      tasks that challenge current performance. Sport organizations in several      countries around the world created specialized training centers where selected      young talents practice under the supervision of experienced coaches in order to      become professional athletes and integrate onto youth national teams. Early      specialization and accurate observation by expert coaches or scouts remain the      only tools to find a potential excellent athlete among a great number of      participants. In the current study, the authors present 2 of the problems raised       by talent search and the risks of such a search. Growth and maturation are      important concepts to better understand the identification, selection, and      development processes of young athletes. However, the literature suggests that      sport-promoting strategies are being maintained despite the increased demands in       the anthropometric characteristics of professional players and demands of actual       professional soccer competitions. On the other hand, identifying biological      variables that can predict performance is almost impossible.FAU - Goncalves C, E BAU  - Goncalves C EBAD  - Faculty of Sport Sciences, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.FAU - Rama L, M LAU  - Rama L MLFAU - Figueiredo, Antonio BAU  - Figueiredo ABLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20120731PL  - United StatesTA  - Int J Sports Physiol PerformJT  - International journal of sports physiology and performanceJID - 101276430SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Adolescent DevelopmentMH  - Age FactorsMH  - *AptitudeMH  - *Athletes/psychologyMH  - *Athletic PerformanceMH  - *Body SizeMH  - ChildMH  - Child DevelopmentMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Models, BiologicalMH  - MotivationMH  - *Physical Education and Training/methodsMH  - SoccerMH  - *SportsMH  - Task Performance and AnalysisEDAT- 2012/08/08 06:00MHDA- 2013/01/24 06:00CRDT- 2012/08/08 06:00PHST- 2012/07/31 [aheadofprint]AID - 2012-0081 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Int J Sports Physiol Perform. 2012 Dec;7(4):390-3.

Matches may also be played at moderate altitude where      the lower oxygen partial pressure exerts a detrimental effect on performance. To       enhance run-based performance, team-sport athletes use varied training strategies      focusing on different aspects of team-sport physiology, including aerobic,      sprint, repeated-sprint and resistance training. Interestingly, 'altitude'      training (i.e. living and/or training in O(2)-reduced environments) has only been      empirically employed by athletes and coaches to improve the basic characteristics      of speed and endurance necessary to excel in team sports. Hypoxia, as an      additional stimulus to training, is typically used by endurance athletes to      enhance performance at sea level and to prepare for competition at altitude.      Several approaches have evolved in the last few decades, which are known to      enhance aerobic power and, thus, endurance performance. Altitude training can      also promote an increased anaerobic fitness, and may enhance sprint capacity.      Therefore, altitude training may confer potentially-beneficial adaptations to      team-sport athletes, which have been overlooked in contemporary sport physiology       research. Here, we review the current knowledge on the established benefits of      altitude training on physiological systems relevant to team-sport performance,      and conclude that current evidence supports implementation of altitude training      modalities to enhance match physical performances at both sea level and altitude.      We hope that this will guide the practice of many athletes and stimulate future      research to better refine training programmes.FAU - Billaut, FrancoisAU  - Billaut FAD  - School of Sport and Exercise Science, Institute of Sport, Exercise and Active      Living (ISEAL), Victoria University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.      francois.billaut@vu.edu.auFAU - Gore, Christopher JAU  - Gore CJFAU - Aughey, Robert JAU  - Aughey RJLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - New ZealandTA  - Sports MedJT  - Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)JID - 8412297SB  - IMCIN - Sports Med. 2012 Dec 1;42(12):1081-3; author reply 1083-5.

The secondary aims       of this study were to document lesson context and coach behavior during practices      and games. METHODS: Participants were 94 girls recruited from 10 teams in three      OS (netball, basketball, and soccer) from the western suburbs of Sydney. Each      participant wore an ActiGraph GT3X monitor for the duration of one practice and      one game. The System for Observing Fitness Instruction Time was concurrently used      to document lesson context and coach behavior. RESULTS: Girls spent a      significantly higher percentage of time in moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) during       practices compared with games (33.8% vs 30.6%; t = 2.94, P < 0.05). Girls spent      approximately 20 min.h(-1) in MVPA during practices and approximately 18      min.h(-1) in MVPA during games. An average of 2957 and 2702 steps per hour were      accumulated during practices and games, respectively. However, girls spent      roughly two-thirds of their OS time in light PA or sedentary. On the basis of the      System for Observing Fitness Instruction Time findings, coaches spent a large      proportion of practice time in management (15.0%) and knowledge delivery (18.5%).      An average of 13.0 and 15.8 occurrences per hour were observed during games and      practices where coaches promoted PA. CONCLUSIONS: For every hour of game play or       practice time, girls accumulated approximately one third of the recommended 60      min of MVPA time and approximately one quarter of the 12,000 steps that girls are      recommended to accumulate daily. For this population, OS seems to make a      substantial contribution to the recommended amounts of MVPA and steps for      participating girls. OS alone, however, does not provide amounts of PA sufficient      to meet daily recommendations for adolescent girls.FAU - Guagliano, Justin MAU  - Guagliano JMAD  - School of Science and Health, University of Western Sydney, Sydney, Australia.FAU - Rosenkranz, Richard RAU  - Rosenkranz RRFAU - Kolt, Gregory SAU  - Kolt GSLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - United StatesTA  - Med Sci Sports ExercJT  - Medicine and science in sports and exerciseJID - 8005433SB  - IMSB  - SMH  - ActigraphyMH  - AdolescentMH  - Basketball/education/*physiologyMH  - ChildMH  - Competitive BehaviorMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - *Motor ActivityMH  - New South WalesMH  - Soccer/education/*physiologyMH  - Time FactorsEDAT- 2012/07/31 06:00MHDA- 2013/05/18 06:00CRDT- 2012/07/31 06:00AID - 10.1249/MSS.0b013e31826a0a73 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Med Sci Sports Exerc. 2013 Jan;45(1):116-22. doi: 10.1249/MSS.0b013e31826a0a73.PMID- 22820209OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20130422DCOM- 20131105IS  - 1533-4287 (Electronic)IS  - 1064-8011 (Linking)VI  - 27IP  - 5DP  - 2013 MayTI  - Building without a plan: the career experiences of Australian strength and      conditioning coaches.PG  - 1423-34LID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e318267a214 [doi]AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to explore the career experiences of      Australian strength and conditioning coaches. Six Australian strength and      conditioning coaches (mean age = 33.7 years, SD = 6.0 years) with a mean of 10.4       (SD = 4.9) years experience working with elite Olympic and professional athletes       were interviewed about their experiences of career development. Each interview      was transcribed verbatim and analyzed to produce key themes and subthemes      relating to (a) work environments, (b) sport management practice, (c) career      development processes, and (d) career building strategies. The work environments       of Australian strength and conditioning coaches were found to be poor because of       long working hours and irregular human resource policy and management practices      of sport organizations. Because of the volatile and unpredictable nature of their      working conditions, the coaches interviewed have only a short-term view of their       career creating considerable stress in their lives. The coaches interviewed found      it difficult to develop their careers because their only options were      self-supported and self-funded professional development activities. The coaches      in this study believed that more needed to be done at a policy and management      level by sport organizations and their professional body to enhance the career      development of strength and conditioning coaches because they play a key role in       both athlete and sport organization performance. These results may help sport      organizations develop policies and management practices that enhance the careers       of strength and conditioning coaches and will have important practical      implications for the education and development of sport professionals.FAU - Dawson, Andrew JAU  - Dawson AJAD  - School of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences, Deakin University, Burwood, Victoria,       Australia. andrew.dawson@deakin.edu.auFAU - Leonard, Zane MAU  - Leonard ZMFAU - Wehner, Kylie AAU  - Wehner KAFAU - Gastin, Paul BAU  - Gastin PBLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Strength Cond ResJT  - Journal of strength and conditioning research / National Strength & Conditioning       AssociationJID - 9415084SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - AttitudeMH  - AustraliaMH  - *Career MobilityMH  - Cross-Sectional StudiesMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - NarrationMH  - Personnel ManagementMH  - *Physical Education and TrainingMH  - Qualitative ResearchMH  - *Resistance TrainingMH  - *SportsMH  - VictoriaMH  - WorkloadMH  - WorkplaceEDAT- 2012/07/24 06:00MHDA- 2013/11/06 06:00CRDT- 2012/07/24 06:00AID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e318267a214 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Strength Cond Res. 2013 May;27(5):1423-34. doi: 10.1519/JSC.0b013e318267a214.PMID- 22781629OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20121122DCOM- 20130415IS  - 1475-5785 (Electronic)IS  - 1353-8047 (Linking)VI  - 18IP  - 6DP  - 2012 DecTI  - Return to pre-injury health status and function 12 months after hospitalisation      for sport and active recreation related orthopaedic injury.PG  - 377-84LID - 10.1136/injuryprev-2011-040190 [doi]AB  - BACKGROUND: Hospitalised sport and active recreation injuries can have serious      long-term consequences. Despite this, few studies have examined the long-term      outcomes of these injuries. The purpose of this study was to establish whether      patients hospitalised with orthopaedic sport and active recreation injuries, have      returned to their pre-injury levels of health status and function, 12 months post      injury and identify factors associated with poor outcomes. The present work was a      cohort study with retrospective assessment of pre-injury status and prospective      assessment of outcome at 12 months post injury. METHODS: Adults with orthopaedic       sport and active recreation injuries, captured by the Victorian Orthopaedic      Trauma Outcomes Registry were recruited to the study. Pre-injury and 12-month      outcomes were assessed using the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and the      extended Glasgow Outcome Scale. Differences in pre-injury and post-injury SF-36      scores were examined and demographic, injury, hospital and physical activity      variables were assessed for associations with outcome using multivariate linear      regression. RESULTS: Of the 324 participants 98% were followed-up at 12 months      post injury. At 12 months, participants reported a mean 7.0-point reduction in      physical health (95% CI 5.8 to 7.8) and a 2.5-point reduction in mental health      (95% CI 1.2 to 3.0), with 58% (95% CI 52.6% to 63.4%) reporting reduced function.      Sporting group (p=0.001), Injury Severity Score >15 (p=0.007) and high pre-injury      vigorous activity levels (p=0.04), were related to poorer physical health      outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: At 12 months post injury, most participants reported large      reductions in physical health and reduced function. This information is important      for furthering our understanding of the burden of sport and active recreation      injury and setting priorities for treatment and rehabilitation.FAU - Andrew, Nadine ElizabethAU  - Andrew NEAD  - Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne,      Victoria, Australia. nadine.andrew@monash.eduFAU - Wolfe, RoryAU  - Wolfe RFAU - Cameron, PeterAU  - Cameron PFAU - Richardson, MartinAU  - Richardson MFAU - Page, RichardAU  - Page RFAU - Bucknill, AndrewAU  - Bucknill AFAU - Gabbe, Belinda JAU  - Gabbe BJLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20120710PL  - EnglandTA  - Inj PrevJT  - Injury prevention : journal of the International Society for Child and Adolescent      Injury PreventionJID - 9510056SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Athletic Injuries/epidemiology/*physiopathologyMH  - Cohort StudiesMH  - FemaleMH  - Follow-Up StudiesMH  - *Health StatusMH  - HospitalizationMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - OrthopedicsMH  - *Outcome Assessment (Health Care)MH  - Recovery of Function/*physiologyMH  - Recreation/*physiologyMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Sports/*physiologyMH  - Treatment OutcomeMH  - Victoria/epidemiologyEDAT- 2012/07/12 06:00MHDA- 2013/04/16 06:00CRDT- 2012/07/12 06:00PHST- 2012/07/10 [aheadofprint]AID - injuryprev-2011-040190 [pii]AID - 10.1136/injuryprev-2011-040190 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Inj Prev. 2012 Dec;18(6):377-84. doi: 10.1136/injuryprev-2011-040190.

Most athletes will continue to train throughout Ramadan, and      they may also be required to compete at this time, but they will also engage in      the religious, cultural, and social activities that Ramadan represents. The      available evidence indicates that high-level athletes can maintain performance      during Ramadan if physical training, food and fluid intake, and sleep are      appropriate and well controlled. Individualized monitoring of athletes may help      to prevent fatigue and overtraining and to reduce the risk of consequent illness       and injury. The timing and intensity of training may require adjustment to      optimize the training response, and training close to or after sunset may have      advantages, but this will vary between individual and team sports and between      environments that are predominantly Muslim and those that are predominantly      non-Muslim. Training late in the day allows nutrition interventions after      training to promote adaptations to the training stimulus, to promote recovery,      and might help to reduce muscle damage. Sleep deficits have a number of adverse      effects on well-being and performance, and athletes should ensure adequate sleep       throughout Ramadan. In non-Muslim majority environments, especially in team      sports, coaches and athletes should be sensitive to the needs of their team-mates      who may be fasting. Event organizers should take account of the needs of Muslim      athletes when scheduling the dates and timings of sports competitions.FAU - Maughan, Ronald JAU  - Maughan RJAD  - School of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Loughborough University, Loughborough, UK.      r.j.maughan@lboro.ac.ukFAU - Zerguini, YacineAU  - Zerguini YFAU - Chalabi, HakimAU  - Chalabi HFAU - Dvorak, JiriAU  - Dvorak JLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - EnglandTA  - J Sports SciJT  - Journal of sports sciencesJID - 8405364SB  - IMMH  - *Adaptation, PhysiologicalMH  - AthletesMH  - Athletic Injuries/prevention & controlMH  - *Athletic PerformanceMH  - *DrinkingMH  - Energy IntakeMH  - ExerciseMH  - *FastingMH  - Fatigue/complications/prevention & controlMH  - Guidelines as TopicMH  - HumansMH  - *IslamMH  - Monitoring, PhysiologicMH  - Muscular Diseases/prevention & controlMH  - Physical Education and TrainingMH  - *SleepMH  - Sleep Deprivation/complications/prevention & controlMH  - Social EnvironmentMH  - *Stress, PhysiologicalEDAT- 2012/07/10 06:00MHDA- 2012/12/10 06:00CRDT- 2012/07/10 06:00AID - 10.1080/02640414.2012.696205 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Sci. 2012;30 Suppl 1:S109-17. doi: 10.1080/02640414.2012.696205.PMID- 22762901OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20120705DCOM- 20130117IS  - 1925-6523 (Electronic)IS  - 1925-6515 (Linking)VI  - 32IP  - 3DP  - 2012 JunTI  - Coaches' knowledge and awareness of spit tobacco use among youth athletes:      results of a 2009 Ontario survey.PG  - 149-55AB  - INTRODUCTION: Public health professionals have become concerned that spit tobacco      (ST) use among athletes is increasing. However, little is known about the issue      in Canada, particularly among youth. METHODS: The Not to Kids Coalition and the      Coaches Association of Ontario surveyed coaches regarding ST knowledge and      awareness and their perceived roles as coaches in influencing ST use among their       athletes. Surveys were distributed electronically to individuals who coached male      and female youth aged 9 to 18 years in baseball, basketball, football, soccer,      and track and field, in Ontario. RESULTS: Almost all of the surveyed coaches      responded correctly to questions about the health effects of ST use, and about      80% of respondents answered correctly to the question about legislation      associated with ST and youth. CONCLUSION: Most coaches are interested in      receiving information about ST, particularly the health effects of ST use and how      to prevent ST use among athletes. Multiple formats should be used to provide      information to coaches, including both electronic and hard copy materials.FAU - Skinner, J H CAU  - Skinner JHAD  - Haliburton, Kawartha, Pine Ridge District Health Unit, Port Hope, Ontario,      Canada. jskinner@hkpr.on.caFAU - Bobbili, S JAU  - Bobbili SJLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - CanadaTA  - Chronic Dis Inj CanJT  - Chronic diseases and injuries in CanadaJID - 101556266SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - ChildMH  - Data CollectionMH  - FemaleMH  - *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, PracticeMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - OntarioMH  - Sports/*psychologyMH  - Tobacco Use Disorder/*prevention & control/psychologyMH  - *Tobacco, SmokelessMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2012/07/06 06:00MHDA- 2013/01/18 06:00CRDT- 2012/07/06 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Chronic Dis Inj Can. 2012 Jun;32(3):149-55.PMID- 24532883OWN - NLMSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINEDA  - 20140217DCOM- 20140217LR  - 20140224IS  - 0377-1237 (Print)IS  - 0377-1237 (Linking)VI  - 68IP  - 3DP  - 2012 JulTI  - Sports related ocular injuries.PG  - 260-6LID - 10.1016/j.mjafi.2011.12.004 [doi]AB  - Every year > 600,000 sports and recreation related eye injuries occur, out of      which roughly 13,500 of these result in permanent loss of sight. Up to 90% of      these sports related eye injuries are preventable by using adequate eye      protection equipment. Protective eyewear is made of polycarbonate, a highly      impact-resistant plastic which is now easily available as prescription and      non-prescription eyewear and all players should be encouraged to use them. The      medical officers by educating their patients regarding the risks of eye injuries       in various sports and the confirmed benefits of using protective equipment have      the potential to prevent injury to over thousands of eyes every year. The medical      fraternity can also play a very important role in educating the coaches, parents,      and children and thus put an end to unnecessary blindness and vision loss from      sports related ocular injuries, therefore ensuring a lifetime of healthy vision.FAU - Mishra, AvinashAU  - Mishra AAD  - Classified Specialist (Ophthalmology), Military Hospital, Dehra Dun, Uttaranchal,      India.FAU - Verma, Ashok KAU  - Verma AKAD  - Commandant, Military Hospital, Dehra Dun, Uttaranchal, India.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20120531PL  - IndiaTA  - Med J Armed Forces IndiaJT  - Medical journal, Armed Forces IndiaJID - 7602492PMC - PMC3862938OID - NLM: PMC3862938OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Ocular traumaOT  - Protective eyewearOT  - SportsEDAT- 2012/07/01 00:00MHDA- 2012/07/01 00:01CRDT- 2014/02/18 06:00PHST- 2011/09/12 [received]PHST- 2011/11/26 [revised]PHST- 2011/12/16 [accepted]PHST- 2012/05/31 [epublish]AID - 10.1016/j.mjafi.2011.12.004 [doi]AID - S0377-1237(12)00060-3 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Med J Armed Forces India. 2012 Jul;68(3):260-6. doi: 10.1016/j.mjafi.2011.12.004.

A total of       243 players from 26 teams representing various interdependent sports completed      French versions of the Role Ambiguity Scale and the Coaching Competency Scale.      Multilevel analyses supported the existence of relationships between the four      dimensions of role ambiguity and the two dimensions of coaching competency at      both individual and team levels. When the levels were considered jointly,      athletes perceiving greater ambiguity in their role in both offensive and      defensive contexts were more critical of their coach's capacities to lead their      team during competitions and to diagnose or formulate instructions during      training sessions. The results also indicated that the dimension of scope of      responsibilities was the main contributor to the relationship with coaching      competency at an individual level, whereas role evaluation was the main      contributor to this relationship at a group level. Findings are discussed in      relation to the role episode model, the role ambiguity dimensions involved in the      relationships according to the level of analysis considered, and the salience of       ambiguity perceptions in the offensive context.FAU - Bosselut, GregoireAU  - Bosselut GAD  - Universite Joseph Fourier, Grenoble, France.FAU - Heuze, Jean-PhilippeAU  - Heuze JPFAU - Eys, Mark AAU  - Eys MAFAU - Fontayne, PaulAU  - Fontayne PFAU - Sarrazin, PhilippeAU  - Sarrazin PLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Sport Exerc PsycholJT  - Journal of sport & exercise psychologyJID - 8809258SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - Athletes/*psychologyMH  - Athletic Performance/psychologyMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - PerceptionMH  - *Professional CompetenceMH  - Professional Role/*psychologyMH  - Psychological TestsMH  - Sex FactorsMH  - Sports/*psychology/standardsMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2012/06/14 06:00MHDA- 2012/10/27 06:00CRDT- 2012/06/14 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Sport Exerc Psychol. 2012 Jun;34(3):345-64.PMID- 22672339OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20130828DCOM- 20140401IS  - 1365-2788 (Electronic)IS  - 0964-2633 (Linking)VI  - 57IP  - 10DP  - 2013 OctTI  - Promoting social inclusion through Unified Sports for youth with intellectual      disabilities: a five-nation study.PG  - 923-35LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2788.2012.01587.x [doi]AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the promotion of social inclusion through sports has      received increased attention with other disadvantaged groups, this is not the      case for children and adults with intellectual disability who experience marked      social isolation. The study evaluated the outcomes from one sports programme with      particular reference to the processes that were perceived to enhance social      inclusion. METHOD: The Youth Unified Sports programme of Special Olympics      combines players with intellectual disabilities (called athletes) and those      without intellectual disabilities (called partners) of similar skill level in the      same sports teams for training and competition. Alongside the development of      sporting skills, the programme offers athletes a platform to socialise with peers      and to take part in the life of their community. Unified football and basketball       teams from five countries--Germany, Hungary, Poland, Serbia and      Ukraine--participated. Individual and group interviews were held with athletes,      partners, coaches, parents and community leaders: totalling around 40 informants       per country. RESULTS: Qualitative data analysis identified four thematic      processes that were perceived by informants across all countries and the two      sports to facilitate social inclusion of athletes. These were: (1) the personal      development of athletes and partners; (2) the creation of inclusive and equal      bonds; (3) the promotion of positive perceptions of athletes; and (4) building      alliances within local communities. CONCLUSIONS: Unified Sports does provide a      vehicle for promoting the social inclusion of people with intellectual      disabilities that is theoretically credible in terms of social capital      scholarship and which contains lessons for advancing social inclusion in other      contexts. Nonetheless, certain limitations are identified that require further      consideration to enhance athletes' social inclusion in the wider community.CI  - (c) 2012 The Authors.

It      mainly includes the prevention and management of athletics-related orofacial      injuries and associated oral diseases. The sports or team dentist assists      athletes in the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of oral injuries. The most      significant aspect in preventing sports-related orofacial injuries is wearing      basic protective devices such as properly-fitting helmets, face masks and/or      mouth guards. Dental injuries are the most common type of orofacial injury      sustained during participation in sports. Many athletes are not aware of the      health implications of a traumatic injury to the mouth or of the potential for      incurring severe head and orofacial injuries while playing. The dentist can play       an imperative role in informing athletes, coaches and patients about the      importance of preventing orofacial injuries in sports. The aim of this paper is      to increase professional awareness and interest for orientation toward sports      dentistry.FAU - Saini, RajivAU  - Saini RAD  - Departments of Periodontology and Oral Implantology, Rural Dental College, Loni,       Ahmednagar, Maharashtra, India.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - IndiaTA  - Natl J Maxillofac SurgJT  - National journal of maxillofacial surgeryJID - 101578767PMC - PMC3343409OID - NLM: PMC3343409OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Dental injuryOT  - mouth gaurdOT  - sportsEDAT- 2012/05/29 06:00MHDA- 2012/05/29 06:01CRDT- 2012/05/29 06:00AID - 10.4103/0975-5950.94465 [doi]AID - NJMS-2-129 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Natl J Maxillofac Surg. 2011 Jul;2(2):129-31. doi: 10.4103/0975-5950.94465.PMID- 22609052OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20130102DCOM- 20130610IS  - 1878-1861 (Electronic)VI  - 16IP  - 1DP  - 2013 JanTI  - The use of the dual-task paradigm in detecting gait performance deficits      following a sports-related concussion: a systematic review and meta-analysis.PG  - 2-7LID - 10.1016/j.jsams.2012.03.013 [doi]LID - S1440-2440(12)00065-5 [pii]AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this systematic review was to determine the viability       of the dual-task paradigm in the evaluation of a sports-related concussion.      DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Eight electronic databases       were searched from their inception until the 11(th) of April 2011. Studies were      grouped according to their reported gait performance variables and their time(s)       of assessment(s). Raw mean differences (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI)      were calculated based on raw means and standard deviations for gait performance      measures in both single- and dual-task conditions. Dual-task deficits were pooled      using a random effects model and heterogeneity (I(2)) between studies was      assessed. RESULTS: Ten studies representing a total sample of 168 concussed and      167 matched (age and gender) non-concussed participants met the inclusion      criteria. Meta-analysis demonstrated that dual-task performance deficits were      detected (p<0.05) in the concussed group for gait velocity (GV) (MD=-0.133; 95%      CI -0.197, -0.069) and range of motion of the centre of mass in the coronal plane      (ML-ROM) (MD=0.007; 95% CI 0.002, 0.011), but not in the non-concussed group; GV       (MD=-0.048; 95% CI -0.101, 0.006), ML-ROM (MD=0.002; 95% CI -0.001, 0.005).      CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that GV and ML-ROM are sensitive       measures of dual-task related changes in concussed patients and should be      considered as part of a comprehensive assessment for a sports-related concussion.CI  - Copyright (c) 2012 Sports Medicine Australia.

We investigated the extent to      which perceptions of coach support reflect characteristics of athletes and      coaches, as well as relational components. In three studies, athletes judged the       actual or hypothetical supportiveness of various coaches. The methods of      generalizability theory permitted us to conclude that perceptions of coach      support primarily reflected relational components, with characteristics both of      athletes and coaches also independently playing (lesser) roles. These findings      suggest that athletes may systematically disagree on the supportiveness of their       coaches.FAU - Rees, TimAU  - Rees TAD  - Sport and Health Sciences, University of Exeter, Exeter, U.K.FAU - Freeman, PaulAU  - Freeman PFAU - Bell, SteveAU  - Bell SFAU - Bunney, RossAU  - Bunney RLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Sport Exerc PsycholJT  - Journal of sport & exercise psychologyJID - 8809258SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Athletes/psychologyMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - PerceptionMH  - Soccer/psychologyMH  - *Social SupportMH  - Sports/*psychologyMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2012/05/19 06:00MHDA- 2012/09/19 06:00CRDT- 2012/05/19 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Sport Exerc Psychol. 2012 Apr;34(2):238-51.PMID- 22605361OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20120518DCOM- 20120918IS  - 1543-2904 (Electronic)IS  - 0895-2779 (Linking)VI  - 34IP  - 2DP  - 2012 AprTI  - Assessing coach motivation: the development of the Coach Motivation Questionnaire      (CMQ).PG  - 184-207AB  - The aim of this research was to develop and assess the psychometric properties of      the Coach Motivation Questionnaire (CMQ). Study 1 focused on the compilation and       pilot testing of potential questionnaire items. Consistent with      self-determination theory, items were devised to tap into six forms of      motivation: amotivation, external regulation, introjected regulation, identified       regulation, integrated regulation, and intrinsic motivation. The purpose of the      second study (N = 556) was to empirically examine the psychometric properties of       the CMQ. Items were subjected to confirmatory factor analyses to determine the      fit of the a priori model. In addition, the validity of the questionnaire was      assessed through links with the theoretically related concepts of intrinsic need       satisfaction, well-being, and goal orientation. Together with test-retest      reliability (Study 3), these results showed preliminary support for the      psychometric properties of the CMQ. Finally, using an independent sample (N =      254), the fourth study confirmed the factor structure and supports the use of the      CMQ in future coaching research.FAU - McLean, Kristy NAU  - McLean KNAD  - School of Human Movement Studies, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD,      Australia.FAU - Mallett, Clifford JAU  - Mallett CJFAU - Newcombe, PeterAU  - Newcombe PLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Sport Exerc PsycholJT  - Journal of sport & exercise psychologyJID - 8809258SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Factor Analysis, StatisticalMH  - FemaleMH  - GoalsMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - *MotivationMH  - Personal AutonomyMH  - PsychometricsMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Reproducibility of ResultsMH  - Sports/*psychologyMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2012/05/19 06:00MHDA- 2012/09/19 06:00CRDT- 2012/05/19 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Sport Exerc Psychol. 2012 Apr;34(2):184-207.PMID- 22592173OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20130301DCOM- 20131118IS  - 1533-4287 (Electronic)IS  - 1064-8011 (Linking)VI  - 27IP  - 3DP  - 2013 MarTI  - The professional experiences and work-related outcomes of male and female      division I strength and conditioning coaches.PG  - 831-8LID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e31825c2fd3 [doi]AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the professional experiences and      work-related outcomes of male and female Division I strength and conditioning      coaches (SCCs).

Whilst this increase is particularly apparent in coaching, a key question       is how to identify an expert coach? Accordingly, this paper draws upon existing      studies into expert coaches to address this issue; in particular, the criteria      used to select expert coaches for research purposes and the methods used in      expert coach research. Based on these data, we contend that the elements of      expertise are not fully reflected within currently accepted criteria which, in      turn, results in expert coaching research not necessarily identifying the      appropriate individuals to study. The paper concludes with recommendations for      more rigorous criteria for selecting expert coaches and highlights the associated      implications for the future training and development of expert coaches.FAU - Nash, ChristineAU  - Nash CAD  - Edinburgh Napier University, SLSSS, Edinburgh, UK. c.nash@napier.ac.ukFAU - Martindale, RussellAU  - Martindale RFAU - Collins, DaveAU  - Collins DFAU - Martindale, AmandaAU  - Martindale ALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Meta-AnalysisDEP - 20120508PL  - EnglandTA  - J Sports SciJT  - Journal of sports sciencesJID - 8405364SB  - IMMH  - HumansMH  - Physical Education and Training/*manpower/*standardsMH  - Professional Competence/*standardsMH  - Sports/*educationEDAT- 2012/05/10 06:00MHDA- 2012/10/23 06:00CRDT- 2012/05/10 06:00PHST- 2012/05/08 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1080/02640414.2012.682079 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Sci. 2012;30(10):985-94. doi: 10.1080/02640414.2012.682079.

With      low levels of oversight and regulation observed in youth sports, the      responsibility for safety education of coaches, parents, law makers,      organizations and institutions falls largely on the sports medicine practitioner.      The highly publicized catastrophic events of concussion, sudden cardiac death,      and heat related illness have moved these topics to the forefront of sports      medicine discussions. Updated guidelines for concussion in youth athletes call      for a more conservative approach to management in both the acute and return to      sport phases. Athletes younger than eighteen suspected of having a concussion are      no longer allowed to return to play on the same day. Reducing the risk of sudden       cardiac death in the young athlete is a multi-factorial process encompassing      pre-participation screenings, proper use of safety equipment, proper rules and      regulations, and immediate access to Automated External Defibrillators (AED) as      corner stones. Susceptibility to heat related illness for youth athletes is no      longer viewed as rooted in physiologic variations from adults, but instead, as      the result of various situations and conditions in which participation takes      place. Hydration before, during and after strenuous exercise in a high heat      stress environment is of significant importance. Knowledge of identification,      management and risk reduction in emergency medical conditions of the young      athlete positions the sports physical therapist as an effective provider,      advocate and resource for safety in youth sports participation. This manuscript      provides the basis for management of 3 major youth emergency sports medicine      conditions.FAU - Merkel, Donna LAU  - Merkel DLFAU - Molony, Joseph T JrAU  - Molony JT JrLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Int J Sports Phys TherJT  - International journal of sports physical therapyJID - 101553140PMC - PMC3325640OID - NLM: PMC3325640OTO - NOTNLMOT  - concussionOT  - heat related illnessOT  - hydrationOT  - sudden cardiac deathOT  - youth sports injuriesEDAT- 2012/04/25 06:00MHDA- 2012/04/25 06:01CRDT- 2012/04/25 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Int J Sports Phys Ther. 2012 Apr;7(2):242-51.PMID- 22506748OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20120417DCOM- 20120615IS  - 0007-1269 (Print)IS  - 0007-1269 (Linking)VI  - 103IP  - 2DP  - 2012 MayTI  - Re-imagining motor imagery: building bridges between cognitive neuroscience and      sport psychology.PG  - 224-47LID - 10.1111/j.2044-8295.2011.02068.x [doi]AB  - One of the most remarkable capacities of the mind is its ability to simulate      sensations, actions, and other types of experience. A mental simulation process      that has attracted recent attention from cognitive neuroscientists and sport      psychologists is motor imagery or the mental rehearsal of actions without      engaging in the actual physical movements involved. Research on motor imagery is       important in psychology because it provides an empirical window on consciousness       and movement planning, rectifies a relative neglect of non-visual types of mental      imagery, and has practical implications for skill learning and skilled      performance in special populations (e.g., athletes, surgeons). Unfortunately,      contemporary research on motor imagery is hampered by a variety of semantic,      conceptual, and methodological issues that prevent cross-fertilization of ideas      between cognitive neuroscience and sport psychology. In this paper, we review      these issues, suggest how they can be resolved, and sketch some potentially      fruitful new directions for inter-disciplinary research in motor imagery.CI  - (c)2011 The British Psychological Society.FAU - Moran, AidanAU  - Moran AAD  - University College Dublin, Ireland.

It is important      that persons involved in youth sports, particularly coaches, be made aware and      educated on the signs and symptoms of concussion. This study assessed the      perceptions of youth sport coaches who have received the Centers for Disease      Control and Prevention's (CDC's) "Heads Up: Concussion in Youth Sports" materials      in preventing, recognizing, and responding to concussions. METHODS: A 22-item      survey was developed with questions pertaining to demographics, awareness of      sports-related concussion, and the usefulness of the CDC's "Heads Up: Concussion       in Youth Sports" initiative and materials. A total of 340 youth sport coaches      completed the survey, for a response rate of 34.0%. RESULTS: All youth sport      coaches reported having the "Heads Up" materials for approximately 6 months      before completing the survey. Seventy-seven percent of youth sports coaches      reported being better able to identify athletes who may have a concussion, with      50% reported having learned something new about concussion after reviewing the      materials. Sixty-three percent of youth sport coaches viewed concussions as being      more serious, while 72% of coaches reporting that they are now educating others      on concussion. CONCLUSION: The "Heads Up" materials demonstrated that youth      sports coaches' were able to appropriately prevent, recognize, and respond to      sports-related concussions after reviewing the materials. Future studies should      concentrate on evaluating the impact of concussion policies, laws and media      coverage on coaches' awareness and prevention, recognition, and response to      concussions using a rigorous design including a control group.CI  - (c) 2012, American School Health Association.FAU - Covassin, TraceyAU  - Covassin TAD  - Michigan State University, Department of Kinesiology, East Lansing, MI 48824,      USA. covassin@msu.eduFAU - Elbin, R JAU  - Elbin RJFAU - Sarmiento, KellyAU  - Sarmiento KLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Evaluation StudiesPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Sch HealthJT  - The Journal of school healthJID - 0376370SB  - IMSB  - NMH  - *Athletic InjuriesMH  - *Brain Concussion/diagnosis/prevention & controlMH  - *Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)MH  - Health Education/*organization & administrationMH  - HumansMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - United StatesEDAT- 2012/04/13 06:00MHDA- 2012/08/18 06:00CRDT- 2012/04/13 06:00AID - 10.1111/j.1746-1561.2012.00692.x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sch Health. 2012 May;82(5):233-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1746-1561.2012.00692.x.PMID- 22489033OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20120410DCOM- 20121004IS  - 1468-3148 (Electronic)IS  - 1360-2322 (Linking)VI  - 25IP  - 3DP  - 2012 MayTI  - Enabling integration in sports for adolescents with intellectual disabilities.PG  - 217-30LID - 10.1111/j.1468-3148.2011.00658.x [doi]AB  - BACKGROUND: Promoting the health and social participation of adolescents with      intellectual disability is important as they are particularly vulnerable to      encountering difficulties in those areas. Integration of these individuals in      integrated sports is one strategy to address this issue. METHODS: The main      objective of this study was to gain a better understanding of the factors      associated with the integration of adolescents with intellectual disability in      sports alongside their non-disabled peers. Individual interviews were completed      with 40 adolescents with intellectual disability and their parents, while 39      rehabilitation staff participated via either a discussion group or      self-administered questionnaires. The Disability Creation Process (DCP)      theoretical model was used to frame the analysis and the presentation of the      findings (The Quebec Classification: Disability Creation Process. International      Network on the Disability Creation Process/CSICIDH, Quebec, QC, 1998). RESULTS:      Various personal and environmental factors that have an impact on integration in       sports were identified by participants. For example, attitudes, practical      support, individuals' experiences in sports and in integrated settings as well as      behaviour control emerged as important elements to consider. CONCLUSIONS:      Integration in integrated sports can engender a lot of benefits for individuals      with intellectual disability, their parents and non-disabled athletes. However,      many barriers need to be removed before such benefits can be more widely      realized.CI  - (c) 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.FAU - Grandisson, MarieAU  - Grandisson MAD  - Universite Laval, Quebec City, QC, Canada. mgran074@uottawa.caFAU - Tetreault, SylvieAU  - Tetreault SFAU - Freeman, Andrew RAU  - Freeman ARLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20120105PL  - EnglandTA  - J Appl Res Intellect DisabilJT  - Journal of applied research in intellectual disabilities : JARIDJID - 9613616SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Adolescent Development/*physiologyMH  - AdultMH  - ChildMH  - Focus GroupsMH  - Health Personnel/psychologyMH  - HumansMH  - Interview, PsychologicalMH  - Mentally Disabled Persons/*rehabilitationMH  - Models, PsychologicalMH  - Parents/*psychologyMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Sports/*psychologyMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2012/04/11 06:00MHDA- 2012/10/05 06:00CRDT- 2012/04/11 06:00PHST- 2012/01/05 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1111/j.1468-3148.2011.00658.x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Appl Res Intellect Disabil. 2012 May;25(3):217-30. doi:      10.1111/j.1468-3148.2011.00658.x.

Little      research exists about sports nutrition knowledge and current available resources       for nutrition information for athletes, coaches, ATs, and SCSs. OBJECTIVE: To      identify resources of nutrition information that athletes, coaches, ATs, and SCSs      use; to examine nutrition knowledge among athletes, coaches, ATs, and SCSs; and      to determine confidence levels in the correctness of nutrition knowledge      questions within all groups. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: National      Collegiate Athletic Association Division I, II, and III institutions across the      United States. PATIENTS AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS: The 579 participants consisted of      athletes (n = 185), coaches (n = 131), ATs (n = 192), and SCSs (n = 71). MAIN      OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Participants answered questions about nutrition resources and      domains regarding basic nutrition, supplements and performance, weight      management, and hydration. Adequate sports nutrition knowledge was defined as an       overall score of 75% in all domains (highest achievable score was 100%). RESULTS:      Participants averaged 68.5% in all domains. The ATs (77.8%) and SCSs (81.6%) had       the highest average scores. Adequate knowledge was found in 35.9% of coaches,      71.4% of ATs, 83.1% of SCSs, and only 9% of athletes. The most used nutrition      resources for coaches, ATs, and SCSs were registered dietitians. CONCLUSIONS:      Overall, we demonstrated that ATs and SCSs have adequate sports nutrition      knowledge, whereas most coaches and athletes have inadequate knowledge. Athletes       have frequent contact with ATs and SCSs; therefore, proper nutrition education      among these staff members is critical. We suggest that proper nutrition      programming should be provided for athletes, coaches, ATs, and SCSs. However, a      separate nutrition program should be integrated for ATs and SCSs. This      integrative approach is beneficial for the continuity of care, as both categories      of professionals might be developing and integrating preventive or rehabilitative      programs for athletes.FAU - Torres-McGehee, Toni MAU  - Torres-McGehee TMAD  - University of South Carolina, Blatt PE Center 218, Columbia, SC 29208, USA.      torresmc@mailbox.sc.eduFAU - Pritchett, Kelly LAU  - Pritchett KLFAU - Zippel, DeborahAU  - Zippel DFAU - Minton, Dawn MAU  - Minton DMFAU - Cellamare, AdamAU  - Cellamare AFAU - Sibilia, MikeAU  - Sibilia MLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Athl TrainJT  - Journal of athletic trainingJID - 9301647SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - *AthletesMH  - Cross-Sectional StudiesMH  - FacultyMH  - FemaleMH  - *Health EducationMH  - *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, PracticeMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - *Nutritional RequirementsMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Random AllocationMH  - SportsMH  - StudentsPMC - PMC3418133OID - NLM: PMC3418133EDAT- 2012/04/11 06:00MHDA- 2013/01/16 06:00CRDT- 2012/04/11 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Athl Train. 2012 Mar-Apr;47(2):205-11.PMID- 22486144OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20120410DCOM- 20120504IS  - 0350-199X (Linking)VI  - 66IP  - 2DP  - 2012TI  - Correlation of aggressiveness and anxiety in fighting sports.PG  - 116-21AB  - INTRODUCTION: in fighting sports there are many opened issues related with levels      of aggression and anxiety. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Our study is performed with      healthy young athletes: kick boxers, karate fighters, and boxers. Examined group       consisted of 55 members (45 male) with average age of 20.2 +/- 3.8 years. In      analysis of level of aggression Questionnaire A-87 is used. Its purpose is      assessment of aggressive behaviour in provoked situations, or measurement of      impulsive aggression. Questionnaire A-87 consists of 15 items of different      situations with five possible responses. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The possible      responses or reactions are the five most frequent forms of aggressive responses:       a) verbal manifest aggression (VM); b) physical manifest aggression (PHM); c)      indirect aggression (IND); d) verbal latent aggression (VL), and e) physical      latent aggression (PHL). In the analysis of anxiety is used Beck Anxiety      Inventory, BAI. Average training period was 7.8 +/- 3.6 years. Even 37 athletes      during sporting carriers were injured, and most of examiners (precisely 13)      experienced 3 injuries. Average value of BAI was 12.7 +/- 8.7. Average value of      total aggression was 152.2 +/- 40.9; highest levels were observed in VM (33.9)      and VL (30.1). Significant positive correlations of all components of aggression       with level of anxiety is observed (p < 0.05), most prominent IND (r = 0.4263; p =      0.0012), and VL (r = 0.4163; p = 0.0016), and also total aggression (r = 0.4822;       p = 0.0002). Slightly significant positive correlation of total aggression with      age of examiners is also observed (r = 0.2668, p = 0.0489). Positive correlation       VM (r = 0.4928; p = 0.0001), PHL (r = 0.2761; p = 0.0413), and total aggression      (r = 0.347; p = 0.0094) is observed with number of injuries of examined athletes.      Also, positive correlation (r = 0.2927, p = 0.0301) is observed with level of      anxiety and number of injuries. Higher level of aggression and anxiety might      change attitude of some sports authorities (especially coaches), and additional      psychological training of fight sports might be necessary. CONCLUSION: Assessment      of basically levels of aggression and anxiety of athletes might be valuable not      only in sport activities, but in overall aspects of life.FAU - Tiric-Campara, MeritaAU  - Tiric-Campara MAD  - Neurology Clinic, Clinical Centre University of Sarajevo, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia       and Herzegovina. merita.tiric@gmail.comFAU - Tupkovic, EmirAU  - Tupkovic EFAU - Mazalovic, EdinAU  - Mazalovic EFAU - Karalic, EmirAU  - Karalic EFAU - Biscevic, MirzaAU  - Biscevic MFAU - Djelilovic-Vranic, JasminkaAU  - Djelilovic-Vranic JFAU - Alajbegovic, AzraAU  - Alajbegovic ALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - Bosnia and HercegovinaTA  - Med ArhJT  - Medicinski arhivJID - 0400722SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - *AggressionMH  - *AnxietyMH  - Boxing/*psychologyMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Martial Arts/*psychologyMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2012/04/11 06:00MHDA- 2012/05/05 06:00CRDT- 2012/04/11 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Med Arh. 2012;66(2):116-21.PMID- 22476167OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20130129DCOM- 20130731IS  - 1533-4287 (Electronic)IS  - 1064-8011 (Linking)VI  - 27IP  - 2DP  - 2013 FebTI  - The effects of tournament preparation on anthropometric and sport-specific      performance measures in youth judo athletes.PG  - 331-9LID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e31825423b3 [doi]AB  - The purpose of this study was to characterize the adaptations imposed by 4 weeks       of precompetition judo training in youth athletes. It was hypothesized that      anthropometric and sport-specific performance would improve during the      preparation for a junior national championship event. Twenty youth athletes (mean      +/- SD; chronological age: 13.1 +/- 3.2 years; training age: 5.3 +/- 3.5 years;      judo experience: 7.8 +/- 2.5 hours per week) completed pretesting and posttesting      procedures. Child (12 years old; n = 8) and adolescent (13 years old; n = 12)      groups were evaluated to determine the anthropometric and sport-specific      performance changes caused by 4 weeks of judo training conducted in preparation      for the junior national championships. The child group showed an increase in      flexibility (11.5%), and the adolescent group showed a decrease in skinfold      thickness (-12.2%); increased jumping power (26.7%), force (7.7%), and velocity      (19.0%); and improved judo-specific ability (-5.9%), as measured by the Special      Judo Fitness Test (SJFT) index. Additionally, the SJFT index for all the study      participants was shown to be inversely correlated to handgrip strength (r =      -0.681), rope pull performance (r = -0.545), and jump height (r = -0.503). These       results support the use of preparatory judo training in the improvement of      anthropometric and sport-specific measures in adolescent athletes. Furthermore,      the outcomes from this study provide direction for coaches and trainers in their       efforts to impact physical performance and judo skills in children and      adolescents through precompetition training.FAU - Fukuda, David HAU  - Fukuda DHAD  - Metabolic and Body Composition Laboratory, Department of Health and Exercise      Science, University of Oklahoma, Norman, Oklahoma, USA. david.fukuda@ou.eduFAU - Stout, Jeffrey RAU  - Stout JRFAU - Kendall, Kristina LAU  - Kendall KLFAU - Smith, Abbie EAU  - Smith AEFAU - Wray, Mandy EAU  - Wray MEFAU - Hetrick, Robert PAU  - Hetrick RPLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Strength Cond ResJT  - Journal of strength and conditioning research / National Strength & Conditioning       AssociationJID - 9415084SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Athletic Performance/*physiologyMH  - Body HeightMH  - Body WeightMH  - ChildMH  - Exercise/*physiologyMH  - FemaleMH  - Hand Strength/physiologyMH  - HumansMH  - Lower ExtremityMH  - MaleMH  - Martial Arts/*physiologyMH  - Motor Skills/physiologyMH  - MovementMH  - Muscle StrengthMH  - Muscle, Skeletal/physiologyMH  - Range of Motion, ArticularMH  - Skinfold ThicknessEDAT- 2012/04/06 06:00MHDA- 2013/08/01 06:00CRDT- 2012/04/06 06:00AID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e31825423b3 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Strength Cond Res. 2013 Feb;27(2):331-9. doi: 10.1519/JSC.0b013e31825423b3.PMID- 22467065OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20120402DCOM- 20120806IS  - 1938-1344 (Electronic)IS  - 0190-6011 (Linking)VI  - 42IP  - 4DP  - 2012 AprTI  - Suggestions from the field for return to sports participation following anterior       cruciate ligament reconstruction: soccer.PG  - 304-12LID - 10.2519/jospt.2012.4005 [doi]AB  - Successful return to play remains a challenge for a soccer player after anterior       cruciate ligament reconstruction. In addition to a successful surgical      intervention, a soccer-specific functional rehabilitation program is essential to      achieve this goal. Soccer-like elements should be incorporated in the early      stages of rehabilitation to provide neuromuscular training specific to the needs       of the player. Gym-based and, later, field-based drills are gradually intensified      and progressed until the player demonstrates the ability to return to team      practice. In addition to the recovery of basic attributes such as mobility,      flexibility, strength, and agility, the surgically repaired knee must also regain      soccer-specific neuromuscular control and conditioning for an effective return to      sports. The individual coaching of the player by the sports physiotherapist and      compliance with the training program by the player are key factors in the      rehabilitation process. To minimize reinjury risk and to maximize the player's      career, concepts of soccer-specific injury prevention programs should be      incorporated into the training routine during and after the rehabilitation of      players post-ACL reconstruction.FAU - Bizzini, MarioAU  - Bizzini MAD  - FIFA-Medical Assessment and Research Centre, Schulthess Clinic, Zurich,      Switzerland. mario.bizzini@f-marc.comFAU - Hancock, DaveAU  - Hancock DFAU - Impellizzeri, FrancoAU  - Impellizzeri FLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20120330PL  - United StatesTA  - J Orthop Sports Phys TherJT  - The Journal of orthopaedic and sports physical therapyJID - 7908150SB  - IMMH  - Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction/*rehabilitationMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - Joint Instability/physiopathology/rehabilitationMH  - Knee/physiologyMH  - Knee Injuries/prevention & control/rehabilitation/surgeryMH  - MaleMH  - Muscle, Skeletal/physiologyMH  - Physical Therapy ModalitiesMH  - Recovery of Function/*physiologyMH  - RiskMH  - Soccer/injuries/*physiologyMH  - Treatment OutcomeEDAT- 2012/04/03 06:00MHDA- 2012/08/07 06:00CRDT- 2012/04/03 06:00PHST- 2012/03/30 [aheadofprint]AID - 2737 [pii]AID - 10.2519/jospt.2012.4005 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Orthop Sports Phys Ther. 2012 Apr;42(4):304-12. doi: 10.2519/jospt.2012.4005.

The question that      arises is whether they make proper medical decisions concerning the health and      safety of their athletes. The purpose of this study was to assess high school      head coaches' decision-making skills related to acute medical condition      management through the use of case scenarios. METHODS: A cover letter/web link to      the web-based survey was e-mailed to all 2008-2009 school year South Dakota high       school head athletic coaches. RESULTS: Head coaches were found to be responsible       for the immediate care of injured athletes at practice (87.2 percent) and home      competitions (72.3 percent). Less than 75.0 percent of coaches reported feeling      "prepared" or "somewhat prepared" to handle 11 of the 16 types of acute athletic       injuries and medical conditions presented, with less than 75.0 percent of coaches      giving "appropriate" or "overly cautious" responses to eight of the 17 cases.      Little to no relationship was found between perceived level of preparedness for      treating various conditions and appropriateness of responses. A significant      difference was found in appropriateness of decisions based on level of athlete      (68.9 percent starters, 79.3 percent non-starters) and event situation (66.5      percent important events, 76.6 percent non-important events). CONCLUSIONS: In      South Dakota, high school coaches are most often responsible for the initial      management of acute injuries; yet, a large percentage of coaches did not feel      "prepared" to manage various conditions and/or gave "inappropriate" responses to       multiple cases. Furthermore, the level of athlete and the event situation may      influence coaches' decisions. Further education may include the proper management      of head and neck injuries, multiple concussions, dislocations, heat emergencies,       eye injuries and internal organ injuries. Health care workers can be an integral       part of training coaches in the care of acute conditions, as well as providing      practice and event coverage.FAU - Cross, Patrick SAU  - Cross PSAD  - University of South Dakota, USA.FAU - Karges, Joy RAU  - Karges JRFAU - Horkey, Melissa AnnAU  - Horkey MAFAU - Kolb, Ginger AAU  - Kolb GAFAU - Alexander, Krystle LAU  - Alexander KLFAU - Knippling, Amy LAU  - Knippling ALFAU - Jacobsen, Jordan AnthonyAU  - Jacobsen JALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - S D MedJT  - South Dakota medicine : the journal of the South Dakota State Medical AssociationJID - 101265265SB  - IMMH  - Acute DiseaseMH  - AdolescentMH  - Analysis of VarianceMH  - Athletic Injuries/*therapyMH  - *Decision MakingMH  - HumansMH  - InternetMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - *SchoolsMH  - South DakotaEDAT- 2012/03/30 06:00MHDA- 2012/05/11 06:00CRDT- 2012/03/30 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - S D Med. 2012 Mar;65(3):97-9, 101-5, 107.PMID- 22450594OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20120430DCOM- 20120829LR  - 20131121IS  - 1536-3724 (Electronic)IS  - 1050-642X (Linking)VI  - 22IP  - 3DP  - 2012 MayTI  - Jet lag and travel fatigue: a comprehensive management plan for sport medicine      physicians and high-performance support teams.PG  - 268-73LID - 10.1097/JSM.0b013e31824d2eeb [doi]AB  - The impact of transcontinental travel and high-volume travel on athletes can      result in physiologic disturbances and a complicated set of physical symptoms.      Jet lag and travel fatigue have been identified by athletes, athletic trainers,      coaches, and physicians as important but challenging problems that could benefit       from practical solutions. Currently, there is a culture of disregard and lack of       knowledge regarding the negative effects of jet lag and travel fatigue on the      athlete's well-being and performance. In addition, the key physiologic metric      (determination of the human circadian phase) that guides jet lag treatment      interventions is elusive and thus limits evidence-based therapeutic advice. A      better understanding of preflight, in-flight, and postflight management options,       such as use of melatonin or the judicious application of sedatives, is important       for the sports clinician to help athletes limit fatigue symptoms and maintain      optimal performance. The purpose of this article was to provide a practical      applied method of implementing a travel management program for athletic teams.FAU - Samuels, Charles HAU  - Samuels CHAD  - Centre for Sleep and Human Performance, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.      dr.samuels@centreforsleep.comLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.PL  - United StatesTA  - Clin J Sport MedJT  - Clinical journal of sport medicine : official journal of the Canadian Academy of       Sport MedicineJID - 9103300RN  - 0 (Hypnotics and Sedatives)RN  - 3G6A5W338E (Caffeine)RN  - JL5DK93RCL (Melatonin)SB  - IMMH  - AthletesMH  - Athletic PerformanceMH  - Caffeine/therapeutic useMH  - Circadian Rhythm/drug effectsMH  - Fatigue/*drug therapyMH  - HumansMH  - Hypnotics and Sedatives/therapeutic useMH  - Jet Lag Syndrome/*drug therapyMH  - Melatonin/therapeutic useMH  - PhysiciansMH  - Sports Medicine/manpowerEDAT- 2012/03/28 06:00MHDA- 2012/08/30 06:00CRDT- 2012/03/28 06:00AID - 10.1097/JSM.0b013e31824d2eeb [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Clin J Sport Med. 2012 May;22(3):268-73. doi: 10.1097/JSM.0b013e31824d2eeb.PMID- 22446680OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20120326DCOM- 20120810IS  - 1533-4287 (Electronic)IS  - 1064-8011 (Linking)VI  - 26IP  - 4DP  - 2012 AprTI  - Perceived social support from strength and conditioning coaches among injured      student athletes.PG  - 1154-61LID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e31822e008b [doi]AB  - Injuries suffered by student athletes not only affect their physical ability to      perform in sport but also have psychological effects as well. The purpose of this      study was to examine student athletes' perceptions, expectations, and      satisfaction of the social support provided by their strength and conditioning      coach (SC) during the later reconditioning stage of their rehabilitation and      their views on the overall level of importance of each type of social support.      One hundred and sixty-five participants aged 20.21 +/- 1.32 years from 6 Division      I Universities in the Midwest region of the USA completed the modified Social      Support Survey. The results of a chi-square test assessing the responses for 6      types of social support provided by SCs based on athletes' age, gender, and sport      revealed a significant difference (chi2[13,105] = 26.46, p = 0.015) for listening      support differing by sport. A significant difference (chi2[13,105] = 267.74, p =       0.010) was also revealed for reported emotional challenge by sport. Results      showed that the SC had a significant psychosocial impact on student-athletes'      overall psychological well-being during reconditioning. This study provides      evidence of the vital psychosocial role that SCs can play during an injured      student-athlete's reconditioning program.FAU - Judge, Lawrence WAU  - Judge LWAD  - Human Performance Laboratory, School of Physical Education, Sport, and Exercise      Science, Ball State University, Muncie, Indiana, USA. lwjudge@bsu.eduFAU - Bellar, DavidAU  - Bellar DFAU - Blom, Lindsey CAU  - Blom LCFAU - Lee, DonAU  - Lee DFAU - Harris, BrianAU  - Harris BFAU - Turk, MichaelAU  - Turk MFAU - McAtee, GlennAU  - McAtee GFAU - Johnson, JamesAU  - Johnson JLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Strength Cond ResJT  - Journal of strength and conditioning research / National Strength & Conditioning       AssociationJID - 9415084SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Athletes/*psychologyMH  - Athletic Injuries/*psychology/rehabilitationMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - *Social SupportMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2012/03/27 06:00MHDA- 2012/08/11 06:00CRDT- 2012/03/27 06:00AID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e31822e008b [doi]AID - 00124278-201204000-00036 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - J Strength Cond Res. 2012 Apr;26(4):1154-61. doi: 10.1519/JSC.0b013e31822e008b.PMID- 22436088OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20140516DCOM- 20150202IS  - 1600-0838 (Electronic)IS  - 0905-7188 (Linking)VI  - 24IP  - 3DP  - 2014 JunTI  - The application of principal component analysis to quantify technique in sports.PG  - 491-9LID - 10.1111/j.1600-0838.2012.01455.x [doi]AB  - Analyzing an athlete's "technique," sport scientists often focus on preselected      variables that quantify important aspects of movement. In contrast, coaches and      practitioners typically describe movements in terms of basic postures and      movement components using subjective and qualitative features. A challenge for      sport scientists is finding an appropriate quantitative methodology that      incorporates the holistic perspective of human observers. Using alpine ski racing      as an example, this study explores principal component analysis (PCA) as a      mathematical method to decompose a complex movement pattern into its main      movement components. Ski racing movements were recorded by determining the      three-dimensional coordinates of 26 points on each skier which were subsequently       interpreted as a 78-dimensional posture vector at each time point. PCA was then      used to determine the mean posture and principal movements (PMk ) carried out by       the athletes. The first four PMk contained 95.5 +/- 0.5% of the variance in the      posture vectors which quantified changes in body inclination, vertical or      fore-aft movement of the trunk, and distance between skis. In summary,      calculating PMk offered a data-driven, quantitative, and objective method of      analyzing human movement that is similar to how human observers such as coaches      or ski instructors would describe the movement.CI  - (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Learning styles is a      learner's preferred mode (e.g., visual, verbal) of taking in and processing new      information. Although it is a relevant topic for the learning of motor and sport       skills, few studies have used an appropriate methodology to test the      effectiveness of learning style-based instruction. We highlight the need for a      learning style assessment tool specific to motor skills and call for a test of      the learning style hypothesis, the claim that learners will benefit from      instruction that is tailored to their individual learning style. To this end, we       suggest methodological guidelines.FAU - Fuelscher, Ian TobiasAU  - Fuelscher ITAD  - Department of Social Sciences and Psychology, Victoria University Melbourne, VIC,      Australia.FAU - Ball, KevinAU  - Ball KFAU - Macmahon, ClareAU  - Macmahon CLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20120307PL  - SwitzerlandTA  - Front PsycholJT  - Frontiers in psychologyJID - 101550902PMC - PMC3298967OID - NLM: PMC3298967OTO - NOTNLMOT  - instructionOT  - learning stylesOT  - skill acquisitionOT  - sport skillsOT  - tennisEDAT- 2012/03/15 06:00MHDA- 2012/03/15 06:01CRDT- 2012/03/15 06:00PHST- 2011/11/16 [received]PHST- 2012/02/21 [accepted]PHST- 2012/03/07 [epublish]AID - 10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00069 [doi]PST - epublishSO  - Front Psychol. 2012 Mar 7;3:69. doi: 10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00069. eCollection 2012.PMID- 22379716OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20120302DCOM- 20120405IS  - 1138-7416 (Print)IS  - 1138-7416 (Linking)VI  - 15IP  - 1DP  - 2012 MarTI  - Aesthetic sports as high-risk contexts for eating disorders--young elite dancers       and gymnasts perspectives.PG  - 265-74AB  - This is the first study developed in Portugal which investigates specific      characteristics of dance and gymnastics environments that make them high-risk      contexts for the development of eating disorders.

Confirmatory factor analysis was      employed to examine the extent to which data collected with 333 Australian      footballers aged between 15 and 18 years (M = 16.88, SD = .71) fitted the a      priori measurement models of both inventories. The results did not support the      psychometric properties of the PPI both in terms of model fit and internal      consistency. Although model fit data for the PPI-A were encouraging, inadequate      levels of internal consistency were evidenced. Convergent validity analyses      involving measures of achievement goals and global mental toughness generally      supported the validity of the PPI and PPI-A subscales. Taken together with      previous research (e.g., Middleton et al., 2004 ), caution is urged when      considering the use of the PPI as a measure of mental toughness in sport.      Although the empirical data were generally supportive of the psychometric      properties of the PPI-A, conceptual (e.g., lack of conceptual underpinnings) and       methodological (i.e., revalidated a flawed inventory) concerns become important      factors when considering the PPI-A as a measure of mental toughness.FAU - Gucciardi, Daniel FAU  - Gucciardi DFAD  - School of Human Movement Studies, The University of Queensland, St Lucia,      Queensland 4072, Australia. d.gucciardi@uq.edu.auLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPT  - Validation StudiesDEP - 20120227PL  - EnglandTA  - J Pers AssessJT  - Journal of personality assessmentJID - 1260201SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Athletes/*psychologyMH  - Athletic Performance/*psychologyMH  - AustraliaMH  - Competitive BehaviorMH  - Factor Analysis, StatisticalMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Mental ProcessesMH  - Personality Inventory/*standardsMH  - PsychometricsMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - *Resilience, PsychologicalMH  - Soccer/*psychologyEDAT- 2012/03/01 06:00MHDA- 2012/11/01 06:00CRDT- 2012/02/29 06:00PHST- 2012/02/27 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1080/00223891.2012.660292 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Pers Assess. 2012;94(4):393-403. doi: 10.1080/00223891.2012.660292.

However, this information may help to prevent, diagnose and       treat sports injuries among teens. 4468 injuries in adolescent patients were      treated over a ten year period of time: 66,97% were boys and 32.88% girls. The      most frequent sports injuries were football (31.13%) followed by handball (8.89%)      and sports during school (8.77%). The lower extremity was involved in 68.71% of      the cases. Knee problems were seen in 29.79% of the patients; 2.57% spine and      1.99% head injuries. Injuries consisted primarily of distortions (35.34%) and      ligament tears (18.76%); 9,00% of all injuries were fractures. We found more skin      wounds (6:1) and fractures (7:2) in male patients compared to females. The risk      of ligament tears was highest during skiing. Three of four ski injuries led to      knee problems. Spine injuries were observed most often during horse riding (1:6).      Head injuries were seen in bicycle accidents (1:3). Head injuries were seen in      male patients much more often then in female patients (21:1). Fractures were      noted during football (1:9), skiing (1:9), inline (2:3), and during school sports      (1:11). Many adolescents participate in various sports. Notwithstanding the      methodological problems with epidemiological data, there is no doubt about the      large number of athletes sustain musculoskeletal injuries, sometimes serious. In       most instances, the accident does not happened during professional sports and      training.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the risk of      low-intensity (e.g., walking, jogging, total distances) and high-intensity (e.g.,      high acceleration and velocity efforts, repeated high-intensity exercise bouts)      movement activities on lower body soft-tissue injury in elite team sport      athletes. Thirty-four elite rugby league players participated in this study.      Global positioning system data and the incidence of lower body soft-tissue      injuries were monitored in 117 skill training sessions during the preseason and      in-season periods. The frailty model (an extension of the Cox proportional      regression model for recurrent events) was applied to calculate the relative risk      of injury after controlling for all other training data. The risk of injury was      2.7 (95% confidence interval 1.2-6.5) times higher when very high-velocity      running (i.e., sprinting) exceeded 9 m per session. Greater distances covered in       mild, moderate, and maximum accelerations and low- and very low-intensity      movement velocities were associated with a reduced risk of injury. These results       demonstrate that greater amounts of very high-velocity running (i.e., sprinting)       are associated with an increased risk of lower body soft-tissue injury, whereas      distances covered at low and moderate speeds offer a protective effect against      soft-tissue injury. From an injury prevention perspective, these findings provide      empirical support for restricting the amount of sprinting performed in      preparation for elite team sport competition. However, coaches should also      consider the consequences of reducing training loads on the development of      physical qualities and playing performance.FAU - Gabbett, Tim JAU  - Gabbett TJAD  - School of Exercise Science, Australian Catholic University, Queensland,      Australia. tim_gabbett@yahoo.com.auFAU - Ullah, ShahidAU  - Ullah SLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Strength Cond ResJT  - Journal of strength and conditioning research / National Strength & Conditioning       AssociationJID - 9415084SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - *AthletesMH  - Athletic Injuries/*epidemiologyMH  - Athletic Performance/physiologyMH  - Football/*injuries/physiologyMH  - HumansMH  - Oxygen Consumption/physiologyMH  - RiskMH  - Running/*injuries/physiologyMH  - Soft Tissue Injuries/*epidemiologyMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2012/02/11 06:00MHDA- 2012/08/11 06:00CRDT- 2012/02/11 06:00AID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3182302023 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Strength Cond Res. 2012 Apr;26(4):953-60. doi: 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3182302023.PMID- 22313707OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20120208DCOM- 20120619IS  - 1753-6405 (Electronic)IS  - 1326-0200 (Linking)VI  - 36IP  - 1DP  - 2012 FebTI  - Implementation of effective alcohol control strategies is needed at large sports       and entertainment events.PG  - 55-60LID - 10.1111/j.1753-6405.2011.00813.x [doi]AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the implementation and effectiveness of strategies and      actions to eliminate and/or reduce alcohol-related problems at large sports and      entertainment events in New Zealand. METHODS: We conducted site visits and      monitoring observations at venues before, during and after a variety of large      events between March 2009 and November 2010. Thirteen events were attended at      nine different venues. Events included rugby, rugby league and cricket matches,      motor racing, rowing, horse racing, an outdoor music festival, and food and wine       festivals. RESULTS: Most large events appeared to pass with few or no      alcohol-related problems. The exceptions were one of the horse-race meetings, a      rugby league match and one food and wine festival. Common contexts at events      where alcohol-related problems were seen included: inadequate alcohol control and      management by security staff; the ability to purchase four alcoholic drinks      (rather than two) at a time; inexperienced bar staff untrained in responsible      alcohol service; no or little promotion of low and non-alcoholic drinks; and a      lack of monitoring and enforcement of the law on intoxication. CONCLUSIONS: An      important approach to prevent and reduce alcohol-related problems at large spots       and entertainment events is the use of specific alcohol-control strategies. The      management of alcohol consumption is a major part of event management that must      be planned with harm-minimisation strategies well in advance of the event itself.      IMPLICATIONS: If strategies and actions are not properly implemented to manage      the sale and supply of alcohol at large events, there is significant risk of      alcohol-related problems and harm resulting from them.CI  - (c) 2012 The Authors.

The large volume of      numerical data generated by GPS technology is usually summarized by reporting the      distance traveled and time spent in various locomotor categories (e.g., walking,       jogging, and running). There are a variety of definitions used in the literature       to represent these categories, which makes it nearly impossible to compare      findings among studies. The purpose of this work was to propose standard      definitions (velocity ranges) that were determined by an objective analysis of      time-motion data. In addition, we discuss the limitations of the existing      definition of a sprint and present a new definition of sprinting for field sport       athletes. Twenty-five GPS data files collected from 5 different sports (men's and      women's field hockey, men's and women's soccer, and Australian Rules Football)      were analyzed to identify the average velocity distribution. A curve fitting      process was then used to determine the optimal placement of 4 Gaussian curves      representing the typical locomotor categories. Based on the findings of these      analyses, we make recommendations about sport-specific velocity ranges to be used      in future time-motion studies of field sport athletes. We also suggest that a      sprint be defined as any movement that reaches or exceeds the sprint threshold      velocity for at least 1 second and any movement with an acceleration that occurs       within the highest 5% of accelerations found in the corresponding velocity range.      From a practical perspective, these analyses provide conditioning coaches with      information on the high-intensity sprinting demands of field sport athletes,      while also providing a novel method of capturing maximal effort, short-duration      sprints.FAU - Dwyer, Dan BAU  - Dwyer DBAD  - University of Newcastle, Environmental and Life Sciences, Ourimbah, Australia.      dan.dwyer@vis.org.auFAU - Gabbett, Tim JAU  - Gabbett TJLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Strength Cond ResJT  - Journal of strength and conditioning research / National Strength & Conditioning       AssociationJID - 9415084SB  - IMMH  - *Athletic Performance/physiology/standardsMH  - FemaleMH  - Football/physiology/standardsMH  - *Geographic Information SystemsMH  - Hockey/physiology/standardsMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - *Running/physiology/standardsMH  - Soccer/physiology/standardsMH  - *Sports/physiology/standardsMH  - Walking/physiology/standardsEDAT- 2012/02/09 06:00MHDA- 2012/06/14 06:00CRDT- 2012/02/08 06:00AID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3182276555 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Strength Cond Res. 2012 Mar;26(3):818-24. doi: 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3182276555.PMID- 22283403OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20120130DCOM- 20120525IS  - 1399-3038 (Electronic)IS  - 0905-6157 (Linking)VI  - 23IP  - 1DP  - 2012 FebTI  - Allergy and sports in children.PG  - 11-20LID - 10.1111/j.1399-3038.2011.01256.x [doi]AB  - Physical activity is beneficial for children with positive outcomes for mental      and physical well-being. Allergic conditions unique to the sporting arena may      serve as an impediment to participation in physical activity for allergic      children. A common example is exercise-induced asthma; less common      activity-related allergic conditions include food-dependent exercise-induced      anaphylaxis, exercise-induced anaphylaxis, and exercise-induced urticaria.      Allergic children may also be at risk of allergic reactions when exposed to      allergens that are more commonly found in the sports environment, e.g., latex,      sports drinks, and medications such as NSAIDs. Recent advances in our      understanding of the patho-physiological and immunologic mechanisms that may      account for these conditions have facilitated more effective and safer management      strategies. There are also important immunologic lessons to be learnt with      respect to specific physical factors that may result in diminished allergen      tolerance; indeed, these lessons may facilitate safer allergen desensitisation      regimens. The role of the immune system in exercise-induced immunoallergic      syndromes, clinical aspects, and diagnostic and therapeutic approaches are      discussed in this review.CI  - (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.FAU - Del Giacco, Stefano RAU  - Del Giacco SRAD  - Department of Medical Sciences M.

Multiple strategies have been used to influence       spectator behavior in youth sport contexts (e.g., "Silent Sundays"). However it      is unlikely that interventions aimed at changing parent-spectator behaviors have       adequately considered young athletes' perspectives, because little is known about      how children want parents to behave during youth sport events. Therefore,      children (ages 7-14 years) were asked to describe how parents actually behaved at      youth sport events and how they wanted parents to behave. Through grounded theory      analysis (Charmaz, 2000), three parent "roles" emerged from the data-supportive      parent, demanding coach, and crazed fan.FAU - Omli, JensAU  - Omli JAD  - Department of Health, Exercise, and Sport Sciences, Texas Tech University,      Lubbock, TX 79409, USA. jens.omli@ttu.eduFAU - Wiese-Bjornstal, Diane MAU  - Wiese-Bjornstal DMLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Res Q Exerc SportJT  - Research quarterly for exercise and sportJID - 8006373SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - BehaviorMH  - ChildMH  - Competitive BehaviorMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - Interviews as TopicMH  - MaleMH  - *Parent-Child RelationsMH  - Parents/*psychologyMH  - *Social PerceptionMH  - *SportsEDAT- 2012/01/27 06:00MHDA- 2012/03/02 06:00CRDT- 2012/01/27 06:00AID - 10.1080/02701367.2011.10599807 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Res Q Exerc Sport. 2011 Dec;82(4):702-11.PMID- 22263781OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20120222DCOM- 20120727IS  - 1466-447X (Electronic)IS  - 0264-0414 (Linking)VI  - 30IP  - 5DP  - 2012TI  - The value of a non-sport-specific motor test battery in predicting performance in      young female gymnasts.PG  - 497-505LID - 10.1080/02640414.2012.654399 [doi]AB  - Gymnastics talent identification focuses on the identification of young gymnasts       who display characteristics for potential success in the future. The aim of this       study was to identify which current performance characteristics are related to      performance in competition 2 years later. Twenty-three female gymnasts aged 7-8      years completed a multidimensional test battery measuring anthropometric,      physical, and coordinative characteristics and were technically evaluated by      expert coaches. Two years later, the all-around competition results of those      gymnasts now participating in elite (n = 12) and sub-elite (n = 11) competition      were obtained. None of the initial measurements significantly correlated with the      results of the sub-elite gymnasts 2 years later. For the elite gymnasts, a      non-sport-specific motor test battery correlated strongly with the competition      result, with more than 40% of the variation in competition performance being      explained by the result on that test 2 years earlier. Neither the coaches'      judgement nor the anthropometric and physical characteristics were sensitive      enough to predict performance. A motor coordination test might be valuable in the      early identification of gymnasts, as its discriminative and predictive qualities       might be sufficiently powerful for selection within a relatively homogeneous      population of gymnasts exhibiting similar anthropometric and physical profiles.FAU - Vandorpe, BarbaraAU  - Vandorpe BAD  - Department of Movement and Sport Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health      Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.FAU - Vandendriessche, Joric BAU  - Vandendriessche JBFAU - Vaeyens, RoelAU  - Vaeyens RFAU - Pion, JohanAU  - Pion JFAU - Lefevre, JohanAU  - Lefevre JFAU - Philippaerts, Renaat MAU  - Philippaerts RMFAU - Lenoir, MatthieuAU  - Lenoir MLA  - engPT  - Evaluation StudiesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20120123PL  - EnglandTA  - J Sports SciJT  - Journal of sports sciencesJID - 8405364SB  - IMMH  - AnthropometryMH  - *Athletic PerformanceMH  - ChildMH  - *Competitive BehaviorMH  - FemaleMH  - *GymnasticsMH  - HumansMH  - *Motor SkillsMH  - Physical Examination/*methodsMH  - *Physical FitnessEDAT- 2012/01/24 06:00MHDA- 2012/07/28 06:00CRDT- 2012/01/24 06:00PHST- 2012/01/23 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1080/02640414.2012.654399 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Sci. 2012;30(5):497-505. doi: 10.1080/02640414.2012.654399.

The       substantive focus was to improve the measurement of coaching efficacy by      developing a revised version of the coaching efficacy scale (CES) for head      coaches (N = 557) of youth sport teams (CES II-YST). The methodological focus was      exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM), a methodology that integrates      the advantages of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor      analysis (CFA) within the general structural equation model (SEM). The synergy      was a demonstration of how ESEM (as compared with CFA) may be used, guided by      content knowledge, to develop (or confirm) a measurement model for the CES      II-YST. A single-group ESEM provided evidence for close model-data fit, while a      single-group CFA fit significantly worse than the single-group ESEM and provided       evidence for only approximate model-data fit.

Twelve elite rugby players      were included in the study. The tests were carried out every 15 days over the      course of one sporting season from July until March, including the interseason.      Changes in body composition parameters, blood biochemistry, and scores on various      questionnaires were examined. The majority of the biochemical parameters and      subjective variables showed significant variations over time. There were      significant positive correlations between overtraining scores and alanine amino      transferase (ALAT; r = 0.24, p < 0.05) and creatine phosphokinase (CK; r = 0.3, p      < 0.01) levels. In addition, game time was significantly correlated with changes       in CK (r = 0.46, p < 0.01), whereas difficult training sessions were      significantly correlated with changes in both CK (r = 0.27, p < 0.05) and ALAT (r      = 0.33, p < 0.01). We suggest that regular monitoring of these biochemical      parameters may provide important information for the coach on the fatigue of      rugby players and their perceived difficulty of training.FAU - Alaphilippe, AnneAU  - Alaphilippe AAD  - Laboratory of Biology of Physical Activity, University of Clermont Ferrand,      Clermont-Ferrand, France.FAU - Mandigout, StephaneAU  - Mandigout SFAU - Ratel, SebastienAU  - Ratel SFAU - Bonis, JoelleAU  - Bonis JFAU - Courteix, DanielAU  - Courteix DFAU - Duclos, MartineAU  - Duclos MLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Strength Cond ResJT  - Journal of strength and conditioning research / National Strength & Conditioning       AssociationJID - 9415084RN  - 0 (Biological Markers)RN  - 0 (Triglycerides)RN  - 268B43MJ25 (Uric Acid)RN  - AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)RN  - EC 2.6.1.1 (Aspartate Aminotransferases)RN  - EC 2.6.1.2 (Alanine Transaminase)RN  - EC 2.7.3.2 (Creatine Kinase)RN  - RFM9X3LJ49 (Bilirubin)SB  - IMMH  - Alanine Transaminase/bloodMH  - Aspartate Aminotransferases/bloodMH  - Bilirubin/bloodMH  - Biological Markers/*bloodMH  - Body CompositionMH  - Creatine Kinase/bloodMH  - Creatinine/bloodMH  - Follow-Up StudiesMH  - Football/*physiologyMH  - FranceMH  - HumansMH  - Longitudinal StudiesMH  - MaleMH  - Muscle Fatigue/*physiologyMH  - Physical Education and TrainingMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Triglycerides/bloodMH  - Uric Acid/bloodMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2012/01/13 06:00MHDA- 2013/05/28 06:00CRDT- 2012/01/13 06:00AID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3182474687 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Strength Cond Res. 2012 Dec;26(12):3376-84. doi: 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3182474687.PMID- 22219217OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20120213DCOM- 20120416IS  - 1473-0480 (Electronic)IS  - 0306-3674 (Linking)VI  - 46IP  - 3DP  - 2012 MarTI  - Lifetime injury prevention: the sport profile model.PG  - 193-7LID - 10.1136/bjsports-2011-090417 [doi]AB  - Participation in sporting activities carries an injury risk. Conversely, the      increased awareness that physical inactivity is a major risk factor for disease      has led government agencies and the medical community to encourage increased      levels of physical activity. Many people will achieve this through participation       in sport. Injury inevitably leads to a reduction in participation on a temporary       or permanent basis, but the injury experience may also influence the lifelong      physical activity behaviour. Few studies adequately examine the possible      long-term consequences of sport participation after the competitive period has      been completed, but by understanding the patterns of injuries in different sports      one test can develop strategies to prevent and better manage the conditions that       occur and promote lifelong physical activity. There is a need to develop models      of understanding of injury risk at different life phases and levels of      participation in a specific sport. The risk assessment of sport participation has      to be relevant to a particular sport, the level of participation, skill, age and       potential future health consequences. This article describes a sport-specific      model which will improve guidance for coaches and healthcare professionals. It      poses questions for sports physicians, healthcare providers, educators and for      governing bodies of sports to address in a systematic fashion. Additionally the      governing body, as an employer, will need to meet the requirements for risk      assessment for professional sport and its ethical responsibility to the athlete.FAU - Webborn, NickAU  - Webborn NAD  - University of Brighton, Sussex Centre for Sport and Exercise Medicine, Sportswise      Limited, The Welkin, Eastbourne, UK. nickwebborn@sportswise.org.ukLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20120104PL  - EnglandTA  - Br J Sports MedJT  - British journal of sports medicineJID - 0432520SB  - IMMH  - Age FactorsMH  - Athletic Injuries/etiology/physiopathology/*prevention & controlMH  - Bone Development/physiologyMH  - Cumulative Trauma Disorders/etiology/physiopathology/prevention & controlMH  - Exercise/physiologyMH  - HumansMH  - Motor Skills/physiologyMH  - Risk FactorsEDAT- 2012/01/06 06:00MHDA- 2012/04/17 06:00CRDT- 2012/01/06 06:00PHST- 2012/01/04 [aheadofprint]AID - bjsports-2011-090417 [pii]AID - 10.1136/bjsports-2011-090417 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Br J Sports Med. 2012 Mar;46(3):193-7. doi: 10.1136/bjsports-2011-090417.

The examination of athletic coach      influence on early college student drinking.PG  - 64-71AB  - Coaches can exert a considerable influence on the lives of their athletes.      However, little is known about the influence of athletic coaches on athlete      drinking behaviors. This study extends research on drinking influences in      student-athletes. The relationship between athletic coaches and athlete drinking       behaviors were examined. First-year college students (N=362) who had played high       school sports were assessed on their relationships with their coaches as well as       their alcohol use and problems. Findings revealed significant associations among       the approval of and relationship with their athletic coaches and student drinking      behaviors. These findings are discussed in the context of involving coaches in      comprehensive strategies to reduce athlete drinking.FAU - Mastroleo, Nadine RAU  - Mastroleo NRAD  - Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies, Brown University, 121S-G-4, Providence,      RI 02912, USA.FAU - Marzell, MieshaAU  - Marzell MAD  - Department of Biobehavioral Health, The Pennsylvania State University, 204 Calder      Way, State College, PA 16801, USA.FAU - Turrisi, RobAU  - Turrisi RAD  - Department of Biobehavioral Health, The Pennsylvania State University, 204 Calder      Way, State College, PA 16801, USA.FAU - Borsari, BrianAU  - Borsari BAD  - Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies, Brown University, 121S-G-4, Providence,      RI 02912, USA ; Mental Health and Behavioral Sciences Service, Department of      Veterans Affairs Medical Center, 830 Chalkstone Avenue, Providence, RI 02908,      USA.LA  - ENGGR  - F31 AA017012/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 AA017427/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLETA  - Addict Res TheoryJT  - Addiction research & theoryJID - 101122095PMC - PMC3955173MID - NIHMS535608OTO - NOTNLMOT  - AthleteOT  - alcoholOT  - coach influencesEDAT- 2012/01/01 00:00MHDA- 2012/01/01 00:00CRDT- 2014/03/19 06:00AID - 10.3109/16066359.2011.562621 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Addict Res Theory. 2012;20(1):64-71.PMID- 24150065OWN - NLMSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINEDA  - 20131023DCOM- 20140624LR  - 20140624IS  - 1303-2968 (Electronic)IS  - 1303-2968 (Linking)VI  - 11IP  - 4DP  - 2012TI  - Concerns regarding hair cortisol as a biomarker of chronic stress in exercise and      sport science.PG  - 571-81AB  - Hair cortisol has the potential to fill the methodological void of long-term      cortisol assessment while becoming a widely accepted measure in biopsychology.      This review critically examines the applicability and relevance of hair cortisol       measurement specifically within the field of exercise and sport science. Current       measures of the HPA axis only cover a brief time period, whereas hair cortisol is      a unique, non-invasive means to capture long- term cortisol secretion. Studies      have shown that individuals who have elevated cortisol secretion (e.g. due to      diseases associated with a disturbed activation of the HPA axis or exposure to      stressful life events) reveal increased hair cortisol. By contrast, only weak      correlations exist between hair cortisol and perceived stress, and the direction       of the relationship between hair cortisol levels and mental disorders is unclear.      Acute exercise, however, results in increased levels of cortisol that eventually       is reflected in higher levels of cortisol in hair samples and studies have shown       that exercise intensity is related to hair cortisol level. Thus, elevated hair      cortisol levels found among regular exercisers are not necessarily pathological.       Thus, one should practice caution when associating athletes' elevated hair      cortisol with poor mental health or disease. Hair cortisol analysis can      contribute to a more complete understanding of how long-term cortisol elevation      mediates stress-related effects on the health and performance of recreational      exercisers and elite athletes. Nevertheless, it is crucial for exercise and sport      scientists to consider whether their research questions can be adequately      addressed, given that regular intense exercise results in substantially augmented      hair cortisol levels.FAU - Gerber, MarkusAU  - Gerber MAD  - Institute of Exercise and Health Sciences, University of Basel.FAU - Brand, SergeAU  - Brand SFAU - Lindwall, MagnusAU  - Lindwall MFAU - Elliot, CatherineAU  - Elliot CFAU - Kalak, NadeemAU  - Kalak NFAU - Herrmann, ChristianAU  - Herrmann CFAU - Puhse, UweAU  - Puhse UFAU - Jonsdottir, Ingibjorg HAU  - Jonsdottir IHLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20121201PL  - TurkeyTA  - J Sports Sci MedJT  - Journal of sports science & medicineJID - 101174629PMC - PMC3763301OID - NLM: PMC3763301OTO - NOTNLMOT  - ExerciseOT  - hair cortisolOT  - physical activityOT  - reviewOT  - stressEDAT- 2012/01/01 00:00MHDA- 2012/01/01 00:01CRDT- 2013/10/24 06:00PHST- 2012/12 [ecollection]PHST- 2012/05/30 [received]PHST- 2012/09/27 [accepted]PHST- 2012/12/01 [epublish]PST - epublishSO  - J Sports Sci Med. 2012 Dec 1;11(4):571-81.PMID- 22198857OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20111226DCOM- 20120628IS  - 1098-9064 (Electronic)IS  - 0094-6176 (Linking)VI  - 37IP  - 8DP  - 2011 NovTI  - Doping and thrombosis in sports.PG  - 918-28LID - 10.1055/s-0031-1297371 [doi]AB  - Historically, humans have long sought to enhance their "athletic" performance to       increase body weight, aggressiveness, mental concentration and physical strength,      contextually reducing fatigue, pain, and improving recovery. Although regular      training is the mainstay for achieving these targets, the ancillary use of      ergogenic aids has become commonplace in all sports. The demarcation between      ergogenic aids and doping substances or practices is continuously challenging and      mostly based on perceptions regarding the corruption of the fairness of      competition and the potential side effects or adverse events arising from the use      of otherwise unnecessary ergogenic substances. A kaleidoscope of side effects has      been associated with the use of doping agents, including behavioral, skeletal,      endocrinologic, metabolic, hemodynamic, and cardiovascular imbalances. Among the       various doping substances, the most striking association with thrombotic      complications has been reported for androgenic anabolic steroids (i.e.,      cardiomyopathy, fatal and nonfatal arrhythmias, myocardial infarction [MI],      intracardiac thrombosis, stroke, venous thromboembolism [VTE], limb arterial      thrombosis, branch retinal vein occlusion, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis) and       blood boosting (i.e., VTE and MI, especially for epoetin and analogs). The      potential thrombotic complication arising from misuse of other doping agents such      as the administration of cortisol, growth hormone, prolactin, cocaine, and      platelet-derived preparations is instead speculative or anecdotal at best. The      present article provides an overview on the epidemiological association as well      as the underlying biochemical and biological mechanisms linking the practice of      doping in sports with the development of thrombosis.CI  - (c) Thieme Medical Publishers.FAU - Lippi, GiuseppeAU  - Lippi GAD  - UO Diagnostica Ematochimica, Dipartimento di Patologia e Medicina di Laboratorio,      Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Parma, Parma, Italy. giuseppe.lippi@univr.itFAU - Banfi, GiuseppeAU  - Banfi GLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20111223PL  - United StatesTA  - Semin Thromb HemostJT  - Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasisJID - 0431155RN  - 0 (Anabolic Agents)SB  - IMMH  - Anabolic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effectsMH  - AnimalsMH  - Doping in Sports/*statistics & numerical dataMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Thrombosis/chemically induced/*epidemiologyEDAT- 2011/12/27 06:00MHDA- 2012/06/29 06:00CRDT- 2011/12/27 06:00PHST- 2011/12/23 [epublish]AID - 10.1055/s-0031-1297371 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Semin Thromb Hemost. 2011 Nov;37(8):918-28. doi: 10.1055/s-0031-1297371.

METHODS: All registered coaches of senior community       rugby union teams in five zones/associations in the north-eastern region of the      state were invited to complete a short online questionnaire at the end of the      2010 rugby season. The questionnaire was designed around the five RE-AIM      dimensions and assessed: Reach, perceived Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation      and Maintenance of the Mayday procedure. RESULTS: Seventy (39%) coaches      participated. There was a high level of awareness of the Mayday procedure, and      most coaches believed it was effective in preventing injuries. The majority      reported training their players in the procedure, although training was generally      infrequent. Coaches were confident that their own players could implement the      procedure appropriately if required to do so, but less confident that other teams      or referees could do so. Barriers to providing training included not enough      players at training, players not taking training seriously and technical      difficulties (eg, verbalisation of instructions for physical tasks). CONCLUSION:       The findings suggest that the translation of the Mayday 'policy' could be      improved by building individual coach, and club or zone organisational capacity      by ensuring that coaches have the resources and skills in 'how' to train their      players to complement their existing knowledge on 'what' to train them; setting      expectations that encourage coaches to provide regular training for players; and       regular monitoring of player competency to perform the procedure appropriately.FAU - Poulos, Roslyn GAU  - Poulos RGAD  - School of Public Health and Community Medicine, The University of New South      Wales, Sydney, Australia. r.poulos@unsw.edu.auFAU - Donaldson, AlexAU  - Donaldson ALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20111221PL  - EnglandTA  - Br J Sports MedJT  - British journal of sports medicineJID - 0432520SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Athletic Injuries/prevention & controlMH  - Attitude to HealthMH  - Clinical Competence/standardsMH  - Emergency Treatment/methodsMH  - Football/*injuriesMH  - Health EducationMH  - Health Knowledge, Attitudes, PracticeMH  - Health PolicyMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - New South WalesMH  - Patient SafetyMH  - Professional PracticeMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - *SafetyMH  - Sports Medicine/educationEDAT- 2011/12/23 06:00MHDA- 2012/08/29 06:00CRDT- 2011/12/23 06:00PHST- 2011/12/21 [aheadofprint]AID - bjsports-2011-090469 [pii]AID - 10.1136/bjsports-2011-090469 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Br J Sports Med. 2012 Jun;46(8):585-90. doi: 10.1136/bjsports-2011-090469.

We interviewed       athletes and coaches in order to better characterize their beliefs about the      definition of an overuse injury, as well as the intrinsic and extrinsic risk      factors that underlie overuse injuries. DESIGN: Qualitative study using in-depth       interviews in athletes and coaches of different sports. METHODS: Athletes who had      experienced overuse injuries and coaches who trained athletes who had sustained      overuse injuries from sports clubs were invited to participate through interview.      We explored each participant's individual definition of an overuse injury and the      beliefs concerning the intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors concerning overuse      injuries were explored. RESULTS: After nine athletes and nine coaches, sample      size saturation was confirmed. Athletes and coaches integrate somatic as well as       psychological and sociological factors into the definition of and risk factors      for overuse injuries. Intrinsic factors for an overuse injury were related to      physical factors, technique, psychological factors and heredity. The extrinsic      factors were related to situational, social and training factors, as well as the       individual coach. CONCLUSIONS: Athletes and coaches have a holistic view on the      definition of overuse injuries, and the intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors for       overuse injuries. If preventive approaches for overuse injuries are developed and      implemented, they should incorporate physical factors, as well as incorporate      psychological and social factors. Based on the input of coaches and athletes, the      latter are important risk factors for overuse injuries.CI  - Copyright A(c) 2011 Sports Medicine Australia. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

These efforts have directly impacted current policy on strategies for injury      assessment and return-to-play by athletes after concussion. Many states are      considering legislation requiring (a) education of athletes, parents, coaches,      and school/organization officials on the recognition, evaluation, and management       of SRCs; (b) removal from play of any youth athlete that is suspected of having      sustained a concussion; and (c) not allowing the student to return to      participation until the student is evaluated and cleared for return to      participation in writing by an appropriate healthcare professional. It is the      official position of the American Academy of Clinical Neuropsychology (AACN),      American Board of Professional Neuropsychology (ABN), Division 40      (Neuropsychology) of the American Psychological Association (APA), and the      National Academy of Neuropsychology (NAN) that neuropsychologists should be      included among the licensed healthcare professionals authorized to evaluate,      clinically manage, and provide return to play clearance for athletes who sustain       a SRC.CI  - (c) The Author 2011.

Debate continues whether children specializing early (ie,      training/competition in a single sport) have true advantage compared with those      who sample various sports early and specialize in a single sport later      (adolescence). Retrospective data and case studies suggest either model yields      elite status depending upon the sport category (ie, situational: ball games,      martial arts, fencing; quantitative: track and field, swimming, skiing; or      qualitative: gymnastics, diving, figure skating). However, potential risks of      early specialization include greater attrition and adverse physical/emotional      health outcomes. With the advent of the IOC Youth Olympic Games, increased      emphasis on global youth competition has unknown implications but also represents      a potential platform for investigation. Modification of youth competition formats      should be based upon multidisciplinary research on psychophysiological responses,      and technical-tactical behaviors during competition. The assumption that a simple      scaled-down approach of adult competitions facilitates the development of      technical/tactical skills of youth athletes is not necessarily substantiated with      field-based research. Relatively little evidence exists regarding the long-term      effects of rigorous training and competitive schedules on children in specific      sports. It is clear that more prospective studies are needed to understand the      training dose that optimally develops adaptations in youth without inducing      dropout, overtraining syndrome, and/or injury. Such an approach should be sport      specific as well as gender based. Until such evidence exists, coaches and sport      administrators will continue to rely upon their sport-specific dogma to influence      programmatic development of our most vulnerable population.FAU - Capranica, LauraAU  - Capranica LAD  - Department of Human Movement and Sport Sciences, University of Rome Foro Italico,      Rome, Italy.FAU - Millard-Stafford, Mindy LAU  - Millard-Stafford MLLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20111201PL  - United StatesTA  - Int J Sports Physiol PerformJT  - International journal of sports physiology and performanceJID - 101276430SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - *Athletic PerformanceMH  - ChildMH  - *Competitive BehaviorMH  - HumansMH  - *Physical Education and TrainingMH  - *SportsEDAT- 2011/12/17 06:00MHDA- 2012/04/06 06:00CRDT- 2011/12/17 06:00PHST- 2011/12/01 [aheadofprint]AID - 2011-0130 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Int J Sports Physiol Perform. 2011 Dec;6(4):572-9.

These      efforts have directly impacted current policy on strategies for injury assessment      and return-to-play by athletes after concussion. Many states are considering      legislation requiring (a) education of athletes, parents, coaches, and      school/organization officials on the recognition, evaluation, and management of      sport-related concussions; (b) removal from play of any youth athlete that is      suspected of having sustained a concussion; and (c) not allowing the student to      return to participation until the student is evaluated and cleared for return to       participation in writing by an appropriate healthcare professional. It is the      official position of the American Academy of Clinical Neuropsychology (AACN),      American Board of Neuropsychology (ABN), Division 40 (Neuropsychology) of the      American Psychological Association (APA), and the National Academy of      Neuropsychology (NAN) that neuropsychologists should be included among the      licensed health care professionals authorized to evaluate, clinically manage, and      provide return to play clearance for athletes who sustain a sport-related      concussion.FAU - Echemendia, Ruben JAU  - Echemendia RJAD  - Psychological and Neurobehavioral Associates, Inc., 204 East Calder Way, State      College, PA, USA. rechemendia@comcast.netFAU - Iverson, Grant LAU  - Iverson GLFAU - McCrea, MichaelAU  - McCrea MFAU - Broshek, Donna KAU  - Broshek DKFAU - Gioia, Gerard AAU  - Gioia GAFAU - Sautter, Scott WAU  - Sautter SWFAU - Macciocchi, Stephen NAU  - Macciocchi SNFAU - Barr, William BAU  - Barr WBLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - EnglandTA  - Clin NeuropsycholJT  - The Clinical neuropsychologistJID - 8806548SB  - IMMH  - Athletic Injuries/complicationsMH  - *Brain Concussion/complications/etiology/therapyMH  - Cognition Disorders/diagnosis/therapyMH  - Disease ManagementMH  - HumansMH  - Neuropsychological TestsMH  - *Neuropsychology/methodsMH  - *Sports MedicineEDAT- 2011/12/17 06:00MHDA- 2012/04/21 06:00CRDT- 2011/12/17 06:00AID - 10.1080/13854046.2011.618466 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Clin Neuropsychol. 2011 Nov;25(8):1289-94. doi: 10.1080/13854046.2011.618466.PMID- 22168369OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20120125DCOM- 20120601IS  - 1466-447X (Electronic)IS  - 0264-0414 (Linking)VI  - 30IP  - 3DP  - 2012TI  - Coaching under pressure: a study of Olympic coaches.PG  - 229-39LID - 10.1080/02640414.2011.639384 [doi]AB  - The Olympic environment has been identified as particularly stressful and unlike       any other in terms of the media attention and focus placed on the competition.      While the potential negative consequences of stress for coaches and their      athletes have been explored, relatively little is known about the factors      underpinning successful Olympic coaching performance. We explored elite coaches'       perceptions of the factors that enable them to coach in a stressful Olympic      environment. Eight coaches from one of Great Britain's most successful Olympic      teams (i.e. consistent medal winners in the previous three Olympics) were      interviewed. Inductive content analysis indicated that psychological attributes      (e.g. emotional control), preparation (e.g. strategic approach), and coping at      the event (e.g. team support) were factors that coaches perceived as important      for successful Olympic coaching. In addition, coaches offered specific      suggestions for training and development. Key themes included coach interaction      (e.g. mentoring, formalizing contact) and simulating Olympic pressure. These      findings offer suggestions for the education of developing coaches on the pathway      to elite sports coaching.FAU - Olusoga, PeterAU  - Olusoga PAD  - Centre for Sport and Exercise Science, Sheffield Hallam University, Sheffield,      UK. p.olusoga@shu.ac.ukFAU - Maynard, IanAU  - Maynard IFAU - Hays, KateAU  - Hays KFAU - Butt, JoanneAU  - Butt JLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20111215PL  - EnglandTA  - J Sports SciJT  - Journal of sports sciencesJID - 8405364SB  - IMMH  - Adaptation, PsychologicalMH  - AdultMH  - Athletes/psychologyMH  - Athletic Performance/psychologyMH  - Great BritainMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Sports/*psychologyMH  - Stress, Psychological/*psychologyEDAT- 2011/12/16 06:00MHDA- 2012/06/02 06:00CRDT- 2011/12/16 06:00PHST- 2011/12/15 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1080/02640414.2011.639384 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Sci. 2012;30(3):229-39. doi: 10.1080/02640414.2011.639384.

These      two types of analysis correspond to two levels of athletes' activity: (a) their      experiences during performance and (b) the biomechanical characteristics of their      movements. Rowing served as an illustration, and the activity of one female crew       member was studied during a race. Three types of data were collected: (a)      audiovisual data recorded during the race; (b) verbalization data obtained in      interviews conducted afterward; and (c) biomechanical data. The courses of      experience of the two rowers during the race were reconstructed on the basis of      the audiovisual and verbalization data. This paper presents a detailed analysis      of a single phenomenon of the race experienced by one of the rowers. According to      the coaches, it reflected a dysfunction in crew coordination. The aim of this      analysis was to identify the biomechanical characteristics of the rowers'      movements that might explain it. The results showed that the phenomenon could be       explained principally by an amplitude differential between the two rowers'      strokes. On this basis, the coaches defined new training objectives to remedy the      dysfunction in crew coordination.CI  - (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

In addition to being places of      mass gathering, stadia are often located in less affluent areas and are      traditionally attended by 'harder to reach' communities. Unfortunately sports      stadia and the clubs they host are rarely perceived as places that promote      healthy lifestyles. Fast food, alcohol and tobacco are commonly advertized,      served and consumed during sports games giving the spectators and TV fans      contradictory messages concerning healthy choices. As part of a wider programme      of work part-funded by the European Union, a study was therefore designed to      explore current 'good practice' relating to positive health interventions in      sports stadia across a number of European countries. Using a specially designed      questionnaire, information about health policies and good practices relating to      food offerings in stadia, physical activity promotion among local communities,      tobacco policy, positive mental health initiatives, environmental sustainability       practices and social responsibility policies were collected in 10 European      countries (England and Northern Ireland, Finland, Georgia, Greece, Ireland,      Italy, Latvia, Poland, Spain and Sweden) involving 88 stadia. The audit results      show that stadia health policies differ considerably between specific countries      and sports. Based on the literature analysed, the examples of good practices      collected through the study, and the subsequent instigation of a European Healthy      Stadia Network, it shows that there is considerable potential for stadia to      become health promoting settings.FAU - Drygas, WojciechAU  - Drygas WAD  - Department of Social and Preventive Medicine, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz,      Poland.FAU - Ruszkowska, JoannaAU  - Ruszkowska JFAU - Philpott, MatthewAU  - Philpott MFAU - Bjorkstrom, OlavAU  - Bjorkstrom OFAU - Parker, MikeAU  - Parker MFAU - Ireland, RobinAU  - Ireland RFAU - Roncarolo, FedericoAU  - Roncarolo FFAU - Tenconi, MariaAU  - Tenconi MLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20111202PL  - EnglandTA  - Health Promot IntJT  - Health promotion internationalJID - 9008939SB  - IMMH  - EuropeMH  - *Health PolicyMH  - Health Promotion/*methodsMH  - HumansMH  - Public Health/methodsMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - *SportsEDAT- 2011/12/06 06:00MHDA- 2014/02/01 06:00CRDT- 2011/12/06 06:00PHST- 2011/12/02 [aheadofprint]AID - dar088 [pii]AID - 10.1093/heapro/dar088 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Health Promot Int. 2013 Jun;28(2):157-65. doi: 10.1093/heapro/dar088.

The chronic      disease impacts negatively not only the patient's own quality of life but also      that of his/her partner and/or relative. As treatment modalities, besides drug      therapy, above all outpatient rehabilitation measures have proved to be      effective. In this pilot study we sought answers to three questions: (i) How is      the quality of life of the patient's partner and/or relative influenced by the      disease? How does the partner/relative assess the effect of the disease on the      chronically ill patient? How does the partner/relative assess the effect of lung       sports on the chronically ill patient? METHODS: A specially conceived      questionnaire was given to the partners/relatives of 25 patients with chronic      pulmonary diseases. The patients, 23 with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease      and 2 with pulmonary fibrosis, have been participating in lung sports once a week      for more than three years. The average age of the patients was 67 years. RESULTS:      The patients' illness also negatively influenced the quality of life of the      partner to a considerable extent. The impact of the patients' pulmonary disease      on the healthy partner was assessed as being rather moderate. Restrictions of      social life were essentially influenced by the amount of assistance required by      the pulmonary patient. The therapeutic effects of lung sports on the well-being      of the patient were aways considered to be positive by the respective      partner/relatives. CONCLUSION: A chronic pulmonary illness also has a negative      influence on the partner/relative's quality of life. The necessity for extensive       assistance in daily life is accompanied by a considerable negative impact on the       partner's quality of life. According to the opinion of the partner/relative, lung      sports have positive effects in all of the chronically ill patient's fields of      life.CI  - (c) Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

Stimulants are included within drug class S.6 under the in-competition testing      section of the List. Athletes may be tempted to use stimulants as ergogenic aids       in-competition in order to temporarily improve their mental and/or physical      functions by increasing alertness, aggressiveness, motivation, locomotion, heart       rate, and reducing fatigue. The Prohibited List Expert Group, responsible for the      maintenance of the List, approved WADA funding for a two-year study to determine       whether athletes were also using stimulants to benefit from their      performance-enhancing effects during the training phase between competitions      (i.e., out-of-competition). This study, involving 11 WADA-accredited      laboratories, found that the use of stimulants by athletes during training was      not significantly prevalent (0.36% of positive findings), suggesting that this      issue does not, at the moment, pose a further challenge to the fight against      doping in sport. In addition, the study supports the current structure in the      Prohibited List that differentiates banned substances into the in- and      out-of-competition classifications.FAU - Boghosian, ThierryAU  - Boghosian TAD  - Science Department, World Anti-Doping Agency, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.FAU - Mazzoni, IreneAU  - Mazzoni IFAU - Barroso, OsquelAU  - Barroso OFAU - Rabin, OlivierAU  - Rabin OLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Anal ToxicolJT  - Journal of analytical toxicologyJID - 7705085RN  - 0 (Performance-Enhancing Substances)SB  - IMMH  - Athletic Performance/statistics & numerical dataMH  - Doping in Sports/methods/*prevention & control/statistics & numerical dataMH  - HumansMH  - Performance-Enhancing Substances/*analysisMH  - *Sports/statistics & numerical dataMH  - Substance Abuse Detection/*methods/statistics & numerical dataEDAT- 2011/11/15 06:00MHDA- 2012/03/08 06:00CRDT- 2011/11/15 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Anal Toxicol. 2011 Nov;35(9):613-6.PMID- 22069389OWN - NLMSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINEDA  - 20111109DCOM- 20111110LR  - 20130813IS  - 1663-070X (Electronic)IS  - 1663-070X (Linking)VI  - 3DP  - 2011TI  - Affective infrastructures: toward a cultural neuropsychology of sport.PG  - 4LID - 10.3389/fnevo.2011.00004 [doi]AB  - Recently there has been a turn toward considerations of embodiment, cognition,      and context in sport studies. Many researchers have argued that the traditional      focus on clinical psychology and performance enhancement within the discipline is      incomplete, and now emphasize the importance of athletes' social and familial      contexts in a research paradigm that examines interconnections between movement,       cognition, emotion, and the social and cultural context in which movement takes      place. While it is important that the sport studies focus is being expanded to      consider these interactions, I will argue that this model is still incomplete in       that it is missing a fundamental variable - that of our evolutionary      neurobiological roots. I will use the work of affective neuroscientists Jaak      Panksepp and Stephen Porges to show that because sport so clearly activates      neural systems that function at both proximate and ultimate levels of causation,       it can be seen to serve fundamental needs for affective balance. A neurobiology      of affect shows how the evolution of the mammalian autonomic nervous system has      resulted in neurophysiological substrates for affective processes and stress      responses, and has wide-ranging implications for sport studies in terms of      suggesting what forms of coaching might be the most effective in what context. I       propose the term cultural neuropsychology of sport as a descriptor for a model      that examines the relationships between neurophysiological substrates and      athletes' social and familial contexts in terms of how these variables facilitate      or fail to facilitate athletes' neuroceptions of safety, which in turn have a      direct impact on their performance. A cultural neuropsychological model of sport       might thereby be seen to elaborate a relationship between proximate and ultimate       mechanisms in concretely applied ways.FAU - Heywood, Leslie LAU  - Heywood LLAD  - Institute for Evolutionary Studies, Binghamton University Binghamton, NY, USA.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20111104PL  - SwitzerlandTA  - Front Evol NeurosciJT  - Frontiers in evolutionary neuroscienceJID - 101509173PMC - PMC3208165OID - NLM: PMC3208165OTO - NOTNLMOT  - SEEKING/PLAY systemsOT  - affective neuroscienceOT  - evolutionary neurobiologyOT  - neuroceptionOT  - sport studiesEDAT- 2011/11/10 06:00MHDA- 2011/11/10 06:01CRDT- 2011/11/10 06:00PHST- 2011/07/15 [received]PHST- 2011/10/14 [accepted]PHST- 2011/11/04 [epublish]AID - 10.3389/fnevo.2011.00004 [doi]PST - epublishSO  - Front Evol Neurosci. 2011 Nov 4;3:4. doi: 10.3389/fnevo.2011.00004. eCollection      2011.PMID- 22043623OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20111102DCOM- 20111129IS  - 0001-4079 (Print)IS  - 0001-4079 (Linking)VI  - 194IP  - 7DP  - 2010 OctTI  - [Sports injuries and their prevention in childhood and adolescence].PG  - 1249-66; discussion 1266-7AB  - Sports injuries are common in children and adolescents.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 101 athletes were observed, HQ (n=16), MQ (n=68) and LQ      (n=17), aged 16.7 +/- 0.5; 16.6 +/- 0.5 and 16.2 +/- 0.7 years, respectively.      There following were evaluated: body mass, height, standing reach height, % body       fat and Heath & Carter somatotype. The statistical analysis was descriptive and      inferential, the Kruskal Wallis test being used for detecting differences between      groups (p<0.05 significance) and Spearman correlation coefficient for      establishing association between anthropometric characteristics and requirement      levels, considering p<0,05 e p<0.01 to be significant and highly significant,      respectively. RESULTS: Significant differences (p<0.05) were detected between      athlete groups for body mass, height, standing reach height and ectomorphy. A      "strong" correlation for height and "regular" correlation for standing reach      height, body mass and ectomorphy were observed, according to players' height or      classification. CONCLUSIONS: The results gave normative data for athletes which      will allow coaches and physical instructors to use such information during      training as a sports' selection instrument for young talented volleyball players.FAU - Fonseca-Toledo, ClaudioAU  - Fonseca-Toledo CAD  - Centro Universitario de Barra Mansa, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil. cltf5@yahoo.com.brFAU - Roquetti, PaulaAU  - Roquetti PFAU - Fernandes-Filho, JoseAU  - Fernandes-Filho JLA  - porPT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticleTT  - Perfil antropometrico de atletas brasileiros de voleibol infanto juvenil em      diferentes niveis de qualificacao esportiva.PL  - ColombiaTA  - Rev Salud Publica (Bogota)JT  - Revista de salud publica (Bogota, Colombia)JID - 100936348SB  - IMMH  - AdiposityMH  - AdolescentMH  - *AthletesMH  - Athletic PerformanceMH  - *Body ConstitutionMH  - Body HeightMH  - Body WeightMH  - BrazilMH  - Cross-Sectional StudiesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - SomatotypesMH  - *VolleyballEDAT- 2011/10/28 06:00MHDA- 2012/05/30 06:00CRDT- 2011/10/28 06:00PHST- 2010/04/06 [received]PHST- 2010/11/29 [accepted]AID - S0124-00642010000600004 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Rev Salud Publica (Bogota). 2010 Dec;12(6):915-28.PMID- 21988896OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20111031DCOM- 20120221LR  - 20141021IS  - 1747-597X (Electronic)IS  - 1747-597X (Linking)VI  - 6DP  - 2011TI  - Is there a danger for myopia in anti-doping education? Comparative analysis of      substance use and misuse in Olympic racket sports calls for a broader approach.PG  - 27LID - 10.1186/1747-597X-6-27 [doi]AB  - BACKGROUND: Racket sports are typically not associated with doping. Despite the      common characteristics of being non-contact and mostly individual, racket sports       differ in their physiological demands, which might be reflected in substance use       and misuse (SUM). The aim of this study was to investigate SUM among Slovenian      Olympic racket sport players in the context of educational, sociodemographic and       sport-specific factors. METHODS: Elite athletes (N=187; mean age=22+/-2.3; 64%      male) representing one of the three racket sports, table tennis, badminton, and      tennis, completed a paper-and-pencil questionnaire on substance use habits.      Athletes in this sample had participated in at least one of the two most recent      competitions at the highest national level and had no significant difference in      competitive achievement or status within their sport. RESULTS: A significant      proportion of athletes (46% for both sexes) reported using nutritional      supplements. Between 10% and 24% of the studied males would use doping if the      practice would help them achieve better results in competition and if it had no      negative health consequences; a further 5% to 10% indicated potential doping      behaviour regardless of potential health hazards. Females were generally less      oriented toward SUM than their male counterparts with no significant differences       between sports, except for badminton players. Substances that have no direct      effect on sport performance (if timed carefully to avoid detrimental effects) are      more commonly consumed (20% binge drink at least once a week and 18% report using      opioids), whereas athletes avoid substances that can impair and threaten athletic      achievement by decreasing physical capacities (e.g. cigarettes), violating      anti-doping codes or potentially transgressing substance control laws (e.g.      opiates and cannabinoids). Regarding doping issues, athletes' trust in their      coaches and physicians is low. CONCLUSION: SUM in sports spreads beyond      doping-prone sports and drugs that enhance athletic performance. Current      anti-doping education, focusing exclusively on rules and fair play, creates an      increasingly widening gap between sports and the athletes' lives outside of      sports. To avoid myopia, anti-doping programmes should adopt a holistic approach       to prevent substance use in sports for the sake of the athletes' health as much      as for the integrity of sports.FAU - Kondric, MiranAU  - Kondric MAD  - Faculty of Sport, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.FAU - Sekulic, DamirAU  - Sekulic DFAU - Petroczi, AndreaAU  - Petroczi AFAU - Ostojic, LjerkaAU  - Ostojic LFAU - Rodek, JelenaAU  - Rodek JFAU - Ostojic, ZdenkoAU  - Ostojic ZLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20111011PL  - EnglandTA  - Subst Abuse Treat Prev PolicyJT  - Substance abuse treatment, prevention, and policyJID - 101258060SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Athletes/*psychologyMH  - Attitude to HealthMH  - Dietary Supplements/statistics & numerical dataMH  - Doping in Sports/*psychology/*statistics & numerical dataMH  - Educational StatusMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Racquet Sports/*psychology/statistics & numerical dataMH  - Sex CharacteristicsMH  - SloveniaMH  - Substance-Related Disorders/*psychologyPMC - PMC3204239OID - NLM: PMC3204239EDAT- 2011/10/13 06:00MHDA- 2012/02/22 06:00CRDT- 2011/10/13 06:00PHST- 2011/08/02 [received]PHST- 2011/10/11 [accepted]PHST- 2011/10/11 [aheadofprint]AID - 1747-597X-6-27 [pii]AID - 10.1186/1747-597X-6-27 [doi]PST - epublishSO  - Subst Abuse Treat Prev Policy. 2011 Oct 11;6:27. doi: 10.1186/1747-597X-6-27.PMID- 21957699OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20110930DCOM- 20111103IS  - 0270-1367 (Print)IS  - 0270-1367 (Linking)VI  - 82IP  - 3DP  - 2011 SepTI  - Sample size and power estimates for a confirmatory factor analytic model in      exercise and sport: a Monte Carlo approach.PG  - 412-23AB  - Monte Carlo methods can be used in data analytic situations (e.g., validity      studies) to make decisions about sample size and to estimate power.

Despite this interest, the role of      sport in post-conflict peace building remains poorly understood. Since peace      building, as a field of study, lends itself to practical approaches that seek to       address underlying sources of violent conflict, it is surprising that it has      neglected to take an interest in sport, especially its grassroots models. In      Africa, football (soccer) in particular has a strong appeal because of its      popularity and ability to mobilise individuals and communities. Through a case      study on Sierra Leone, this paper focuses on sports in a particularly prominent      post-civil war UN intervention-the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration       (DDR) process-to determine how ex-youth combatants, camp administrators and      caregivers perceive the role and significance of sporting activities in interim      care centres (ICCS) or DDR camps. It argues that sporting experiences in ddr      processes are fruitful microcosms for understanding nuanced forms of violence and      healing among youth combatants during their reintegration process.FAU - Dyck, Christopher BAU  - Dyck CBAD  - University of Alberta, Canada.LA  - engPT  - Historical ArticlePT  - Journal ArticlePL  - EnglandTA  - Third World QJT  - Third world quarterlyJID - 101084672SB  - QMH  - *Acculturation/historyMH  - AdolescentMH  - Africa/ethnologyMH  - History, 20th CenturyMH  - History, 21st CenturyMH  - HumansMH  - *Mental Healing/history/psychologyMH  - Sierra Leone/ethnologyMH  - *Soccer/economics/education/history/physiology/psychologyMH  - *Social Behavior/historyMH  - *Social Behavior Disorders/ethnology/historyMH  - Social Change/historyMH  - Sports/economics/education/history/physiology/psychologyEDAT- 2011/09/29 06:00MHDA- 2011/10/01 06:00CRDT- 2011/09/29 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Third World Q. 2011;32(3):395-415.PMID- 21937746OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20120227DCOM- 20120727IS  - 1938-2707 (Electronic)IS  - 0009-9228 (Linking)VI  - 51IP  - 3DP  - 2012 MarTI  - Do youth hockey coaches allow players with a known concussion to participate in a      game?PG  - 283-7LID - 10.1177/0009922811422434 [doi]AB  - Ice hockey is a high-risk sport for concussion. It is important that coaches have      an understanding of concussion, although previous studies have demonstrated poor       knowledge of concussion recognition and management by youth coaches. A      cross-sectional survey with 7 case scenarios was completed by 314 youth hockey      coaches. Each case scenario described a player with a concussion during a game,      and scores reflected how the coach would respond to each scenario. Although most       coaches would not allow a player to continue participating in a game after      suffering a concussion, there was a small percentage that would. Statistical      analysis found an inverse relationship between the coaches' age and consideration      of continued participation. This places athletes at significant risk for further       injury and is not consistent with current concussion guidelines.

The use of projection machines in developmental and      elite fast ball sports programmes is not a trivial issue, since they play a      crucial role in reducing injury incidence in players and coaches. A compelling      challenge for sports science is to provide theoretical principles to guide 'how'       and 'when' projection machines might be used for acquisition of ball skills and      preparation for competition in developmental and elite sport performance      programmes. In this article, we propose how principles from an ecological      dynamics theoretical framework could be adopted by sports scientists, pedagogues       and coaches to underpin the design of interventions, practice and training tasks,      including the use of hybrid video-projection technologies. The assessment of      representative learning design during practice may provide ways to optimize      developmental programmes in fast ball sports and provide information on the      principled use of ball projection machines.FAU - Pinder, Ross AAU  - Pinder RAAD  - Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation, Queensland University of      Technology, Brisbane, QLD, Australia. ross.pinder@qut.edu.auFAU - Renshaw, IanAU  - Renshaw IFAU - Davids, KeithAU  - Davids KFAU - Kerherve, HugoAU  - Kerherve HLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - New ZealandTA  - Sports MedJT  - Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)JID - 8412297SB  - IMMH  - Athletic Performance/education/physiology/psychologyMH  - HumansMH  - Psychomotor Performance/*physiologyMH  - Sports/education/*physiology/psychologyMH  - Task Performance and AnalysisEDAT- 2011/09/20 06:00MHDA- 2012/01/28 06:00CRDT- 2011/09/20 06:00AID - 1 [pii]AID - 10.2165/11595450-000000000-00000 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Sports Med. 2011 Oct 1;41(10):793-800. doi: 10.2165/11595450-000000000-00000.PMID- 21904702OWN - NLMSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINEDA  - 20110909DCOM- 20111110LR  - 20130529IS  - 2159-2896 (Electronic)VI  - 6IP  - 3DP  - 2011 SepTI  - The use of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the automated external defibrillator      in the practice of sports physical therapy.PG  - 267-70AB  - During the initial assessment of the injured athlete, the Sports Physical      Therapist (PT) must first be concerned with life-threatening emergencies such as       absence of breathing and pulse. The sports PT must also be aware of the      possibility of "sudden cardiac death" that could occur in others, including      coaches, officials, and fans. If the PT assumes the role of "most medical" person      at the contest or event, the responsibility for life saving action falls squarely      on their shoulders. Therefore, skills and ongoing certification in cardio-      pulmonary resuscitation techniques and the use of an automated external      defibrillator are a basic necessity. These skills are required as part of the      specialty practice of sports PT (BLS Healthcare Provider course or CPR for the      Professional Rescuer in addition to completion of the First Responder Course OR      credentials as an EMT or ATC), and are mandatory for being qualified to sit for      the exam to become a sports certified specialist (SCS) by the American Board of      Physical Therapy Specialties (ABPTS).(3).FAU - Smith, DannyAU  - Smith DFAU - Hoogenboom, BarbAU  - Hoogenboom BLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Int J Sports Phys TherJT  - International journal of sports physical therapyJID - 101553140PMC - PMC3164003OID - NLM: PMC3164003OTO - NOTNLMOT  - automated external defibrillatorOT  - cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency responseEDAT- 2011/09/10 06:00MHDA- 2011/09/10 06:01CRDT- 2011/09/10 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Int J Sports Phys Ther. 2011 Sep;6(3):267-70.PMID- 21904695OWN - NLMSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINEDA  - 20110909DCOM- 20111110LR  - 20130529IS  - 2159-2896 (Electronic)VI  - 6IP  - 3DP  - 2011 SepTI  - Management of acute sports injuries and medical conditions by physical      therapists: assessment via case scenarios.PG  - 158-72AB  - PURPOSE/BACKGROUND: Some physical therapists (PTs) provide services at sporting      events, but there are limited studies investigating whether PTs are properly      prepared to provide such services. The purpose of this study was to assess acute       sports injury and medical condition management decision-making skills of PTs.      METHODS: A Web-based survey presented 17 case scenarios related to acute medical       conditions and sport injuries. PTs from the Sports Physical Therapy Section of      The American Physical Therapy Association were e-mailed a cover letter/Web link      to the survey and invited to participate over a 30-day period. Data were analyzed      using SPSS 18.0. RESULTS: A total of 411 of 5158 PTs who were members of the      Sports Physical Therapy Association in 2009 and had valid e-mail addresses      completed the survey, of which 389 (7.5%) were appropriate for analysis. Over      75.0% of respondents felt "prepared" or "somewhat prepared" to provide immediate       care for 13 out of 16 medical conditions, with seizures, spinal cord injuries,      and internal organ injuries having the lowest percentages. Over 75.0% of the      respondents made "appropriate" or "overly cautious" decisions for 11 of the 17      acute injury or medical condition cases. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the current      study indicate that PTs felt more "prepared" and tended to make "appropriate"      return to play decisions on the acute sports injury and medical condition case      studies more often than coaches who participated in a similar study, regardless      of level of importance of the game or whether the athlete was a starter vs.      non-starter. However, for PTs who plan on assisting at sporting events,      additional preparation/education may be recommended, such as what is taught in an      emergency responder course.FAU - Cross, Patrick StephenAU  - Cross PSFAU - Karges, Joy RenaeAU  - Karges JRFAU - Salsbery, Mitchell AAU  - Salsbery MAFAU - Smith, DannaAU  - Smith DFAU - Stanley, Erica JAU  - Stanley EJLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Int J Sports Phys TherJT  - International journal of sports physical therapyJID - 101553140PMC - PMC3163996OID - NLM: PMC3163996OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Acute sports injury managementOT  - return to play decisionsEDAT- 2011/09/10 06:00MHDA- 2011/09/10 06:01CRDT- 2011/09/10 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Int J Sports Phys Ther. 2011 Sep;6(3):158-72.PMID- 21901268OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20111103DCOM- 20120228IS  - 1433-8491 (Electronic)IS  - 0940-1334 (Linking)VI  - 261 Suppl 2DP  - 2011 NovTI  - Sport psychiatry and psychotherapy.

Challenge and answer to societal changes.PG  - S182-5LID - 10.1007/s00406-011-0239-x [doi]AB  - Professional athletes are subject to massive somatic, social, and mental stress.       Despite great public interest for athletic achievements, the emotional strains      thereof are very poorly investigated and discussed. The main reason for this is      the widespread assumption that only emotionally very strong athletes are able to       compete at the highly professional level and therefore mental disorders do not      exist in professional sports. But available research data about the prevalence of      mental disorders in this area suggest that this hypothesis must be revised. With       respect to depression and the overtraining syndrome, attempts have been made to      demonstrate the difficulties with etiology, diagnostics, and treatment for sports      psychiatry and psychotherapy. Scientifically, sport psychiatry and psychotherapy       can be defined as a discipline, whose focus is the investigation, treatment, and       prevention of the extreme and sports-specific emotional strains and disorders.

The present study aims to evaluate the nutrition       knowledge of students receiving sports education in universities. METHODS: The      study sample consists of 343 voluntary students from the Sports Departments of      Hacettepe, Gazi and Ankara Universities in Ankara. The questionnaire used in the       study included a demographic section, and 30 questions on true-false nutrition      knowledge. For the reliability of the questionnaire, the internal consistency      coefficient was calculated and the Kuder Richardson (KR-20) value was found to be      0.71. For higher reliability, 9 dysfunctional questions were excluded from the      questionnaire. The research data were collected through a questionnaire form and       face-to-face interviews. For the statistical analyses of the data, tables were      prepared to show mean, standard deviation (X+/-SD) and percentage (%) values. In       order to determine the nutrition knowledge of students, the "independent t test"       was used for nutrition lesson and gender. RESULTS: University students receiving       sports education and expected to continue their professional lives on      sport-related fields were determined to have the lack of knowledge on nutrition.       The mean value about the nutrition knowledge of the first year students was found      11.150 +/- 2.962, while the mean value of the fourth year students was 13.460 +/-      3.703, and the difference is statistically significant (p = .000). CONCLUSION:      Students, coaches and teachers in physical education were found not to give the      necessary importance to their diets, and they were still not aware of the      importance of nutrition on performance.FAU - Ozdogan, YahyaAU  - Ozdogan YAD  - Department of Nutrition Sciences, School of Home Economics, Ankara University,      Ankara, Turkey. yozdogan@ankara.edu.tr.FAU - Ozcelik, Ayse OzferAU  - Ozcelik AOLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20110905PL  - United StatesTA  - J Int Soc Sports NutrJT  - Journal of the International Society of Sports NutritionJID - 101234168PMC - PMC3177873OID - NLM: PMC3177873EDAT- 2011/09/07 06:00MHDA- 2011/09/07 06:01CRDT- 2011/09/07 06:00PHST- 2011/03/20 [received]PHST- 2011/09/05 [accepted]PHST- 2011/09/05 [aheadofprint]AID - 1550-2783-8-11 [pii]AID - 10.1186/1550-2783-8-11 [doi]PST - epublishSO  - J Int Soc Sports Nutr. 2011 Sep 5;8:11. doi: 10.1186/1550-2783-8-11.PMID- 21888675OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20110929DCOM- 20120316LR  - 20141120IS  - 1479-5868 (Electronic)IS  - 1479-5868 (Linking)VI  - 8DP  - 2011TI  - "Food company sponsors are kind, generous and cool": (mis)conceptions of junior      sports players.PG  - 95LID - 10.1186/1479-5868-8-95 [doi]AB  - BACKGROUND: Children's exposure to unhealthy food marketing influences their food      knowledge, preferences and consumption. Sport sponsorship by food companies is      widespread and industry investment in this marketing is increasing. This study      aimed to assess children's awareness of sport sponsors and their brand-related      attitudes and purchasing intentions in response to this marketing. METHODS:      Sports clubs known to have food sponsors and representing the most popular sports      for Australian children across a range of demographic areas were recruited.      Interview-based questionnaires were conducted at clubs with children aged 10-14      years (n = 103) to examine their recall of local sports club and elite sport      sponsors, and their attitudes towards sponsors and sponsorship activities.      RESULTS: Most children (68%) could recall sponsors of their sports club, naming a      median of two sponsors, including a median of one food company sponsor each.      Almost half (47%) of children could recall any sponsors of their favourite elite       sporting team. Children aged 10-11 years were more likely than older children to       report that they thought about sponsors when buying something to eat or drink (P       < 0.01); that they liked to return the favour to sponsors by buying their      products (P < 0.01); and that sponsors were 'cool' (P = 0.02). Most children had       received a voucher or certificate from a food or beverage company to reward sport      performance (86% and 76%, respectively). Around one-third of children reported      liking the company more after receiving these rewards. CONCLUSIONS: Children's      high recall of food and beverage company sport sponsors and their positive      attitudes towards these sponsors and their promotions is concerning as this is      likely to be linked to children's food preferences and consumption. Limiting      children's exposure to this marketing is an important initiative to improve      children's nutrition.FAU - Kelly, BridgetAU  - Kelly BAD  - Prevention Research Collaboration, School of Public Health, University of Sydney,      Sydney, Australia. bridget.kelly@sydney.edu.auFAU - Baur, Louise AAU  - Baur LAFAU - Bauman, Adrian EAU  - Bauman AEFAU - King, LesleyAU  - King LFAU - Chapman, KathyAU  - Chapman KFAU - Smith, Ben JAU  - Smith BJLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20110905PL  - EnglandTA  - Int J Behav Nutr Phys ActJT  - The international journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activityJID - 101217089SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Athletes/*psychologyMH  - *AttitudeMH  - AustraliaMH  - ChildMH  - *Consumer BehaviorMH  - FemaleMH  - *Food IndustryMH  - *Food PreferencesMH  - HumansMH  - IntentionMH  - MaleMH  - *MarketingMH  - Mental RecallMH  - OrganizationsMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - RewardMH  - SportsPMC - PMC3179435OID - NLM: PMC3179435EDAT- 2011/09/06 06:00MHDA- 2012/03/17 06:00CRDT- 2011/09/06 06:00PHST- 2011/03/28 [received]PHST- 2011/09/05 [accepted]PHST- 2011/09/05 [aheadofprint]AID - 1479-5868-8-95 [pii]AID - 10.1186/1479-5868-8-95 [doi]PST - epublishSO  - Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act. 2011 Sep 5;8:95. doi: 10.1186/1479-5868-8-95.PMID- 21873747OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20110829DCOM- 20120116IS  - 1512-0112 (Print)IS  - 1512-0112 (Linking)IP  - 196-197DP  - 2011 Jul-AugTI  - Concepts of neurodevelopment in sports activity for adolescents.PG  - 7-12AB  - This article highlights comments on this question for both teenager and parent,      focusing on key underlying concepts as neurodevelopment and sports readiness.      Issues regarding neurodevelopment in adolescent sports are considered in this      article. Understanding the neurodevelopment of the Adolescent Athlete and how      this development impacts sports participation is critical for clinicians to      provide parents, coaches, and sports organizers with valuable information about      how to select activities for their children that will have a positive impact on      their overall growth and development as well as optimize their benefit from      sports play. Stories of child prodigies who began to learn a specific sport      before age three stimulate parents to question whether or not they also should be      enrolling their very young children in such aggressive training programs.

The afferent dynamic seeing occurs via the retiina which      mediates the stimuli for efferent dynamic seeing . The aim of this study was to      examine the dynamic visual acuity of sportsmen from sports with different demands      on their dynamic seeing (DS). METHODS: 19 sports students took part in the study.      10 subjects participated in coached team sports (group I) and 9 remaining      performed individual sports (group II). The DS was assessed by means of the      Dusseldorfer test for dynamic seeing of Wist which was performed twice on one      day. RESULTS: The DS of the two groups in the first study did not differ (right      eye 95.7 +/- 10.6 % in group I vs. 94.3 +/- 6.9 % in group II and left eye 97.6      +/- 4.8 % vs. 95.3 +/- 5.6 %; p >/= 0.05). Also the second study there was no      different in DS for the two groups (right eye 98.3 +/- 2.6 % vs. 93.8 +/- 8.0 %      and left eye 99.3 +/- 1.2 % vs. 95.6 +/- 7.0 %; p >/= 0.05). DISCUSSION: Our      hypothesis about a different DS in players of ball games compared with non-ball      sport players could not be proved. It is to be critically noted that a      generalization is not possible due to the small sample numbers. Because DS is a      necessary precondition in ball games further studies should be concentrated on      its trainability.CI  - (c) Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

Both field and court team sports are      characterized by intermittent activity requiring a heavy reliance on dietary      carbohydrate sources to maintain and replenish glycogen. Energy and substrate      demands are high during pre-season training and matches, and moderate during      training in the competitive season. Dietary planning must include enough      carbohydrate on a moderate energy budget, while also meeting protein needs.      Strength and power team sports require muscle-building programmes that must be      accompanied by adequate nutrition, and simple anthropometric measurements can      help the nutrition practitioner monitor and assess body composition periodically.      Use of a body mass scale and a urine specific gravity refractometer can help      identify athletes prone to dehydration. Sports beverages and caffeine are the      most common supplements, while opinion on the practical effectiveness of creatine      is divided. Late-maturing adolescent athletes become concerned about gaining size      and muscle, and assessment of maturity status can be carried out with      anthropometric procedures. An overriding consideration is that an individual      approach is needed to meet each athlete's nutritional needs.FAU - Holway, Francis EAU  - Holway FEAD  - Nutrition, Club Atletico River Plate, Buenos Aires, Argentina.FAU - Spriet, Lawrence LAU  - Spriet LLLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20110811PL  - EnglandTA  - J Sports SciJT  - Journal of sports sciencesJID - 8405364RN  - 0 (Dietary Carbohydrates)RN  - 0 (Dietary Proteins)RN  - 9005-79-2 (Glycogen)SB  - IMMH  - Athletic Performance/*physiologyMH  - Body CompositionMH  - Body WeightMH  - DehydrationMH  - *DietMH  - Dietary CarbohydratesMH  - Dietary ProteinsMH  - Dietary SupplementsMH  - *Energy IntakeMH  - Energy MetabolismMH  - Exercise/*physiologyMH  - Glycogen/metabolismMH  - Guidelines as TopicMH  - HumansMH  - *Nutritional RequirementsMH  - *Nutritional StatusMH  - Physical Education and TrainingMH  - Sports/*physiologyEDAT- 2011/08/13 06:00MHDA- 2012/05/26 06:00CRDT- 2011/08/12 06:00PHST- 2011/08/11 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1080/02640414.2011.605459 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Sci. 2011;29 Suppl 1:S115-25. doi: 10.1080/02640414.2011.605459.

OBJECTIVE: To validate the Slovenian translation of      Medical Outcome Survey (MOS) Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and to assess      relations among various knee measurements, activity tested with Oxford Knee Score      (OKS) and health-related quality of life as estimated with SF-36 domains. DESIGN:      Descriptive validation study. SETTING: Isokinetic laboratory in outpatient      rehabilitation unit. PARTICIPANTS: 101 subjects after unilateral sport knee      injury. INTERVENTIONS: All subjects completed the SF-36 and OKS, and isokinetic      knee-muscle strength output at 60 degrees /s was determined in 78 participants.      Within a 3-d period, 43 subjects completed the SF-36 and OKS questionnaires      again. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Reliability testing included internal consistency      and test-retest reliability. Correlations between SF-36 subscales and OKS were      calculated to assess construct validity, and correlation between SF-36 subscales       and muscle strength was calculated to assess concurrent validity. RESULTS:      Chronbach alpha was above .78 for all SF-36 subscales. ICCs ranged from .80 to      .93. The correlation between OKS and the physical-functioning subscale, showing      convergent construct validity, was higher (r = .83, P < .01) than between OKS and      mental health (r = .50, P < .01), showing divergent construct validity.      Knee-extensor weakness negatively correlated with physical-functioning (r = -.59,      P < .01) and social-functioning (r = -.43, P < .01) subscales. CONCLUSIONS: The      Slovenian translation of the SF-36 is a reliable and valuable tool. The      relationships between knee-muscle strength and activity and between knee-muscle      strength and SF-36 subscales in patients after sport knee injury were      established.FAU - Marn-Vukadinovic, DusaAU  - Marn-Vukadinovic DAD  - Rehabilitation Dept for Patients With Trauma and Peripheral Nerve Lesions,      University Rehabilitation Institute Soca, Ljubljana, Republic of Slovenia.FAU - Jamnik, HelenaAU  - Jamnik HLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Validation StudiesPL  - United StatesTA  - J Sport RehabilJT  - Journal of sport rehabilitationJID - 9206500SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Athletic Injuries/physiopathology/*rehabilitationMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - Knee Injuries/physiopathology/*rehabilitationMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Muscle Contraction/physiologyMH  - *Muscle Strength DynamometerMH  - Physical Therapy ModalitiesMH  - Quality of LifeMH  - *QuestionnairesMH  - Reproducibility of ResultsMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2011/08/11 06:00MHDA- 2011/09/29 06:00CRDT- 2011/08/11 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Sport Rehabil. 2011 Aug;20(3):261-76.PMID- 21808078OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20110802DCOM- 20110920IS  - 0895-2779 (Print)IS  - 0895-2779 (Linking)VI  - 33IP  - 4DP  - 2011 AugTI  - Prosocial and antisocial behavior in sport: the role of coaching style,      autonomous vs. controlled motivation, and moral disengagement.PG  - 527-47AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine whether the relationships between      contextual factors (i.e., autonomy-supportive vs. controlling coaching style) and      person factors (i.e., autonomous vs. controlled motivation) outlined in      self-determination theory (SDT) were related to prosocial and antisocial      behaviors in sport. We also investigated moral disengagement as a mediator of      these relationships. Athletes' (n = 292, M = 19.53 years) responses largely      supported our SDT-derived hypotheses. Results indicated that an      autonomy-supportive coaching style was associated with prosocial behavior toward       teammates; this relationship was mediated by autonomous motivation. Controlled      motivation was associated with antisocial behavior toward teammates and      antisocial behavior toward opponents, and these two relationships were mediated      by moral disengagement. The results provide support for research investigating      the effect of autonomy-supportive coaching interventions on athletes' prosocial      and antisocial behavior.FAU - Hodge, KenAU  - Hodge KAD  - School of Physical Education, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.FAU - Lonsdale, ChrisAU  - Lonsdale CLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Sport Exerc PsycholJT  - Journal of sport & exercise psychologyJID - 8809258SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Athletic Performance/psychologyMH  - Competitive Behavior/physiologyMH  - FemaleMH  - GoalsMH  - Group ProcessesMH  - HumansMH  - Interpersonal RelationsMH  - *LeadershipMH  - MaleMH  - *MoralsMH  - Motivation/*physiologyMH  - New ZealandMH  - *Personal AutonomyMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - *Social BehaviorMH  - Social SupportMH  - Social ValuesMH  - Sports/*psychologyMH  - Students/psychologyMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2011/08/03 06:00MHDA- 2011/09/21 06:00CRDT- 2011/08/03 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Sport Exerc Psychol. 2011 Aug;33(4):527-47.PMID- 21796094OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20110728DCOM- 20110919LR  - 20111021IS  - 1545-861X (Electronic)IS  - 0149-2195 (Linking)VI  - 60IP  - 29DP  - 2011 Jul 29TI  - Nonfatal sports and recreation heat illness treated in hospital emergency      departments--United States, 2001-2009.PG  - 977-80AB  - Although heat illness is recognized as a leading cause of death and disability      during participation in U.S. high school and collegiate athletics, the incidence       of heat illness among younger children and adults participating in sports and      recreational activities is unknown. To examine the incidence and characteristics       of nonfatal sports and recreation heat illness among persons of all ages, CDC      analyzed 2001-2009 data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance      System--All Injury Program. This report describes the results of that analysis,      which found that an estimated 5,946 persons were treated in U.S. emergency      departments (EDs) each year for a heat illness sustained while participating in a      sport or recreational activity, for an estimated annual rate of 2.0 ED visits per      100,000 population. Incidence was highest among males (72.5%) and among those      aged 15-19 years (35.6%), and 7.1% of patients were hospitalized. These findings       highlight the need for effective heat illness prevention messages to target all      persons who are physically active, including those who participate in      unstructured sports and recreational activities. Specific emphasis should be      placed on targeting appropriate prevention messages toward those aged 15-19      years, who are at greatest risk, and their coaches and parents.CN  - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly RepJT  - MMWR.

We adopted a longitudinal perspective, taking measures at the middle and      the end of a sport season, as well as at the beginning of the following season.      Multilevel modeling analyses showed that perceptions of task-involving peer and      coach climates were predictive of more adaptive outcomes than were perceptions of      ego-involving peer and coach climates. Predictive effects differed as a function       of time and outcome variable under investigation. The results indicate the      importance of considering peer influence in addition to coach influence when      examining motivational climate in youth sport.FAU - Ntoumanis, NikosAU  - Ntoumanis NAD  - College of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham,      United Kingdom. n.ntoumanis@bham.ac.ukFAU - Taylor, Ian MAU  - Taylor IMFAU - Thogersen-Ntoumani, CecilieAU  - Thogersen-Ntoumani CLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20110725PL  - United StatesTA  - Dev PsycholJT  - Developmental psychologyJID - 0260564SB  - IMMH  - *AchievementMH  - AdolescentMH  - *Adolescent BehaviorMH  - ChildMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - Longitudinal StudiesMH  - MaleMH  - *MoraleMH  - *Peer GroupMH  - *Personal SatisfactionMH  - Predictive Value of TestsMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Regression AnalysisMH  - Sports/*psychologyEDAT- 2011/07/27 06:00MHDA- 2012/05/11 06:00CRDT- 2011/07/27 06:00PHST- 2011/07/25 [aheadofprint]AID - 2011-15908-001 [pii]AID - 10.1037/a0024934 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Dev Psychol. 2012 Jan;48(1):213-23. doi: 10.1037/a0024934.

METHODS: The data were      obtained by using a three-section questionnaire including a socio demographic      data form and the Turkish version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory from 65 judo      coaches working in the Turkish Judo and Kurash Federation. RESULTS: In the      analysis of data, descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation) and      one-way ANOVA tests were used. This study showed that judo coaches have medium      level burnout experience. The results also showed that there were significant      differences in the emotional exhaustion levels of judo coaches based on coaching       experience in years and satisfaction status from their sport administrators.      CONCLUSIONS: Burnout appears to be a problematic issue for judo coaches. When      coaches begin to feel emotionally depleted, they distance themselves from      athletes, and experience a reduced sense of meaning about their work; it is      likely to affect the quality of the athletic experience for both the coach and      the athletes.FAU - Gencay, SelcukAU  - Gencay SAD  - Department of Physical Education and Sport Teaching, School of Physical Education      and Sport, Kahramanmaras Sutcu Imam University, Turkey. agencay@gmail.comFAU - Gencay, Okkes AlpaslanAU  - Gencay OALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20110720PL  - JapanTA  - J Occup HealthJT  - Journal of occupational healthJID - 9616320SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Analysis of VarianceMH  - Burnout, Professional/*epidemiologyMH  - EmotionsMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - Job SatisfactionMH  - MaleMH  - Martial Arts/education/*psychologyMH  - Middle AgedMH  - PrevalenceMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Turkey/epidemiologyEDAT- 2011/07/23 06:00MHDA- 2012/03/01 06:00CRDT- 2011/07/23 06:00PHST- 2011/07/20 [aheadofprint]AID - JST.JSTAGE/joh/10-0064-FS [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - J Occup Health. 2011;53(5):365-70.

However, all studies in this area were based on      cross-sectional designs. OBJECTIVE: To fill a gap in research by exploring      associations between sport involvement and suicide ideation and attempts      (suicidality) based on a 5-year longitudinal, population-based study. STUDY      GROUP: Participants (n = 739) completed surveys in middle school and high school.      METHODS: Logistic regression analysis compared suicidality during high school      across four groups: youth who participated in sport in both middle and high      school, youth who participated only in middle school or only in high school, and       youth who did not participate in sport during adolescence. RESULTS: Compared to      non-participants, youth involved in sport in both middle and high school had      lower odds of suicidal ideation during high school. Youth who discontinued sport       after middle school had higher odds of attempting suicide during high school than      non-participants. CONCLUSIONS: Remaining involved in sport throughout adolescence      can offer mental health benefits. Future research should identify mechanisms that      account for protective relationships between involvement in sport throughout      adolescence and suicidality, and identify factors that explain deleterious      relationships for youth who discontinue sport early in adolescence.FAU - Taliaferro, Lindsay AAU  - Taliaferro LAAD  - Healthy Youth Development Prevention Research Center, Division of Adolescent      Health and Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota,      Minneapolis, MN 55414, USA ltaliafe@umn.eduFAU - Eisenberg, Marla EAU  - Eisenberg MEFAU - Johnson, Karen EAU  - Johnson KEFAU - Nelson, Toben FAU  - Nelson TFFAU - Neumark-Sztainer, DianneAU  - Neumark-Sztainer DLA  - engGR  - R40 MC00310/PHS HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPT  - Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.PL  - GermanyTA  - Int J Adolesc Med HealthJT  - International journal of adolescent medicine and healthJID - 8506960SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Chi-Square DistributionMH  - Depression/epidemiology/psychologyMH  - FemaleMH  - Health BehaviorMH  - HumansMH  - Logistic ModelsMH  - Longitudinal StudiesMH  - MaleMH  - Psychology, AdolescentMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Sports/*psychologyMH  - *Suicidal IdeationMH  - Suicide, Attempted/*psychology/*statistics & numerical dataEDAT- 2011/07/05 06:00MHDA- 2011/07/27 06:00CRDT- 2011/07/05 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Int J Adolesc Med Health. 2011;23(1):3-10.PMID- 21699102OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20110624DCOM- 20110811IS  - 0270-1367 (Print)IS  - 0270-1367 (Linking)VI  - 82IP  - 2DP  - 2011 JunTI  - Excellence in coaching: the art and skill of elite practitioners.PG  - 229-38AB  - During this study, 10 expert coaches were interviewed to examine their views on      aspects of their individual coaching practice. Four themes emerged from the      interviews: (a) the long-term approach, (b) the authentic coaching environment,      (c) creating a learning environment, and (d) the quality and quantity of training      sessions. These coaches were consistent in their attempts to facilitate learning       experiences for the athletes, while setting high standards in both training and      competition. The study's findings show that expert coaches have to orchestrate a       large number of variables when planning and executing a training session, and      their success depends on their coaching knowledge and their skill at      contextualizing the necessary components for specific situations.FAU - Nash, Christine SAU  - Nash CSAD  - Department of Sport and Exercise Science, Edinburgh Napier University, Edinburgh,      UK. c.nash@napier.ac.ukFAU - Sproule, JohnAU  - Sproule JFAU - Horton, PeterAU  - Horton PLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Res Q Exerc SportJT  - Research quarterly for exercise and sportJID - 8006373SB  - IMMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - Interviews as TopicMH  - KnowledgeMH  - MaleMH  - Physical Education and Training/*methodsMH  - Practice (Psychology)MH  - Sports/*educationEDAT- 2011/06/28 06:00MHDA- 2011/08/13 06:00CRDT- 2011/06/25 06:00AID - 10.1080/02701367.2011.10599750 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Res Q Exerc Sport. 2011 Jun;82(2):229-38.PMID- 21694594OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20110630DCOM- 20111108IS  - 1536-3724 (Electronic)IS  - 1050-642X (Linking)VI  - 21IP  - 4DP  - 2011 JulTI  - Sport-related concussions: knowledge translation among minor hockey coaches.PG  - 315-9LID - 10.1097/JSM.0b013e31821e2b78 [doi]AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate minor hockey coaches'      knowledge base of sport-related concussions. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey.      SETTING: Subjects independently completed the written survey at preseason      organizational meetings. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred seventy-eight active coaches      spanning 5 age levels (ages 5-15 years). Coaches reported 2.62 +/- 3.73 years of       coaching experience. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Resources where coaches obtained      information about concussions, perceptions of variables associated with      concussions, knowledge level of issues associated with concussions, and      decision-making practices. RESULTS: Newspapers and magazines were the most      frequent source of information regarding concussions, yet were rated as not very       helpful. Family physicians were less frequently sought but were rated as most      helpful. A majority of coaches reported limited knowledge about concussions but      rated this knowledge as being important. There was a significant relationship      between head coaching experience and concussion knowledge [R = 0.09, F3,156 =      4.41, P = 0.005]. Most coaches demonstrated a good knowledge base of common      issues associated with concussions, and a majority of individuals correctly      identified return-to-play practices. CONCLUSIONS: A majority of minor hockey      coaches correctly recognized and understood issues related to sport-related      concussions. Results suggested that knowledge translation through various formal       and informal sources has had a positive effect. However, a majority of coaches      reported having limited knowledge about concussions yet consider it an important       topic.FAU - Mrazik, MartinAU  - Mrazik MAD  - Department of Educational Psychology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta,      Canada. mrazik@ualberta.caFAU - Bawani, FarzadAU  - Bawani FFAU - Krol, Andrea LAU  - Krol ALLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - United StatesTA  - Clin J Sport MedJT  - Clinical journal of sport medicine : official journal of the Canadian Academy of       Sport MedicineJID - 9103300SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - *AthletesMH  - Brain Concussion/*diagnosis/physiopathologyMH  - ChildMH  - Child, PreschoolMH  - Cross-Sectional StudiesMH  - Decision MakingMH  - FemaleMH  - *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, PracticeMH  - Hockey/*injuriesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Severity of Illness IndexEDAT- 2011/06/23 06:00MHDA- 2011/11/09 06:00CRDT- 2011/06/23 06:00AID - 10.1097/JSM.0b013e31821e2b78 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Clin J Sport Med. 2011 Jul;21(4):315-9. doi: 10.1097/JSM.0b013e31821e2b78.PMID- 21675576OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20110616DCOM- 20110708IS  - 0033-2941 (Print)IS  - 0033-2941 (Linking)VI  - 108IP  - 2DP  - 2011 AprTI  - Prediction of intrinsic motivation and sports performance using 2 x 2 achievement      goal framework.PG  - 625-37AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of 2 x 2 achievement goals      on intrinsic motivation and performance in handball.

All completed the 2 x 2 Achievement Goals Questionnaire for      Sport and the Intrinsic Motivation subscale of the Sport Motivation Scale; the      coach for each team rated his athletes' overall sports performance. Using      simultaneous-regression analyses, mastery-approach goals positively predicted      both intrinsic motivation and performance in sports, whereas      performance-avoidance goals negatively predicted sports performance. These      results suggest that athletes who pursue task mastery and improvement of their      competence perform well and enjoy their participation.

BACKGROUND: Unsafe weight management practices can compromise athletic      performance and negatively affect health. Athletes and clients often attempt to      lose weight by not eating, limiting caloric or specific nutrients from the diet,       engaging in pathogenic weight control behaviors, and restricting fluids. These      people often respond to pressures of the sport or activity, coaches, peers, or      parents by adopting negative body images and unsafe practices to maintain an      ideal body composition for the activity. We provide athletic trainers with      recommendations for safe weight loss and weight maintenance in sport and      exercise. Although safe weight gain is also a concern for athletic trainers and      their athletes and clients, that topic is outside the scope of this position      statement. RECOMMENDATIONS: Athletic trainers are often the source of nutrition      information for athletes and clients; therefore, they must have knowledge of      proper nutrition, weight management practices, and methods to change body      composition. Body composition assessments should be done in the most      scientifically appropriate manner possible. Reasonable and individualized weight       and body composition goals should be identified by appropriately trained health      care personnel (eg, athletic trainers, registered dietitians, physicians). In      keeping with the American Dietetics Association (ADA) preferred nomenclature,      this document uses the terms registered dietitian or dietician when referring to       a food and nutrition expert who has met the academic and professional      requirements specified by the ADA's Commission on Accreditation for Dietetics      Education. In some cases, a registered nutritionist may have equivalent      credentials and be the commonly used term. All weight management and exercise      protocols used to achieve these goals should be safe and based on the most      current evidence. Athletes, clients, parents, and coaches should be educated on      how to determine safe weight and body composition so that athletes and clients      more safely achieve competitive weights that will meet sport and activity      requirements while also allowing them to meet their energy and nutritional needs       for optimal health and performance.FAU - Turocy, Paula SammaroneAU  - Turocy PSAD  - Duquesne University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.FAU - DePalma, Bernard FAU  - DePalma BFFAU - Horswill, Craig AAU  - Horswill CAFAU - Laquale, Kathleen MAU  - Laquale KMFAU - Martin, Thomas JAU  - Martin TJFAU - Perry, Arlette CAU  - Perry ACFAU - Somova, Marla JAU  - Somova MJFAU - Utter, Alan CAU  - Utter ACCN  - National Athletic Trainers' AssociationLA  - engPT  - GuidelinePT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Athl TrainJT  - Journal of athletic trainingJID - 9301647SB  - IMMH  - Adipose Tissue/physiologyMH  - AthletesMH  - Body Composition/physiologyMH  - Body Mass IndexMH  - DietMH  - Diet, Reducing/methodsMH  - Energy MetabolismMH  - *ExerciseMH  - HumansMH  - Sports/*physiologyMH  - TeachingMH  - *Weight LossPMC - PMC3419563OID - NLM: PMC3419563EDAT- 2011/06/15 06:00MHDA- 2012/01/18 06:00CRDT- 2011/06/15 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Athl Train. 2011 May-Jun;46(3):322-36.PMID- 21659673OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20110610DCOM- 20110711IS  - 0895-2779 (Print)IS  - 0895-2779 (Linking)VI  - 33IP  - 3DP  - 2011 JunTI  - Perception of coaching behaviors, coping, and achievement in a sport competition.PG  - 460-8AB  - This study examined the relationship between perceived coaching behaviors, coping      strategies during a sport competition, and sport achievement. A prospective      design was used in which 80 athletes from individual sports completed measures of      perceived coaching behaviors two days before a competition (Time 1) and measures       of coping and sport achievement within three hours after a sport competition      (Time 2). As expected, results of multiple regressions indicated that supportive       coaching was a positive predictor of task-oriented coping and sport achievement      whereas unsupportive coaching was a positive predictor of disengagement-oriented       coping. Both types of coping were significantly associated with sport      achievement. Task-oriented coping was a significant partial mediator in the      relation between supportive coaching and sport achievement. This study, which      contributes to both the coaching and coping literatures, highlights the role of      supportive coaching behaviors in the initiation of effective stress management      during sport competitions.FAU - Nicolas, MichelAU  - Nicolas MAD  - Faculty of Sport Sciences in Dijon, Universite de Bourgogne, Dijon, France.FAU - Gaudreau, PatrickAU  - Gaudreau PFAU - Franche, VeroniqueAU  - Franche VLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - United StatesTA  - J Sport Exerc PsycholJT  - Journal of sport & exercise psychologyJID - 8809258SB  - IMMH  - *AchievementMH  - Adaptation, PsychologicalMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - Athletic Performance/*psychologyMH  - *Competitive BehaviorMH  - FemaleMH  - GoalsMH  - HumansMH  - Internal-External ControlMH  - Interpersonal RelationsMH  - LeadershipMH  - MaleMH  - Motivation/physiologyMH  - Prospective StudiesMH  - *Social BehaviorMH  - *Social PerceptionMH  - Social SupportMH  - Sports/physiology/*psychologyMH  - Stress, Psychological/psychologyMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2011/06/11 06:00MHDA- 2011/07/12 06:00CRDT- 2011/06/11 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Sport Exerc Psychol. 2011 Jun;33(3):460-8.PMID- 21659670OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20110610DCOM- 20110711IS  - 0895-2779 (Print)IS  - 0895-2779 (Linking)VI  - 33IP  - 3DP  - 2011 JunTI  - Tripartite efficacy profiles: a cluster analytic investigation of athletes'      perceptions of their relationship with their coach.PG  - 394-415AB  - Recent studies of coach-athlete interaction have explored the bivariate      relationships between each of the tripartite efficacy constructs (self-efficacy;       other-efficacy; relation-inferred self-efficacy, or RISE) and various indicators       of relationship quality. This investigation adopted an alternative approach by      using cluster analyses to identify tripartite efficacy profiles within a sample      of 377 individual sport athletes (Mage = 20.25, SD = 2.12), and examined how      individuals in each cluster group differed in their perceptions about their      relationship with their coach (i.e., commitment, satisfaction, conflict). Four      clusters emerged: High (n = 128), Moderate (n = 95), and Low (n = 78) profiles,      in which athletes reported relatively high, moderate, or low scores across all      tripartite perceptions, respectively, as well as an Unfulfilled profile (n = 76)       in which athletes held relatively high self-efficacy, but perceived lower levels       of other-efficacy and RISE. Multivariate analyses revealed differences between      the clusters on all relationship variables that were in line with theory. These      results underscore the utility of considering synergistic issues in the      examination of the tripartite efficacy framework.FAU - Jackson, BenAU  - Jackson BAD  - School of Sport Science, Exercise and Health, University of Western Australia,      Crawley, WA, Australia.FAU - Gucciardi, Daniel FAU  - Gucciardi DFFAU - Dimmock, James AAU  - Dimmock JALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - United StatesTA  - J Sport Exerc PsycholJT  - Journal of sport & exercise psychologyJID - 8809258SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - Analysis of VarianceMH  - Athletes/*psychologyMH  - Cluster AnalysisMH  - Conflict (Psychology)MH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - *Interpersonal RelationsMH  - MaleMH  - Motivation/physiologyMH  - *Personal SatisfactionMH  - *Self EfficacyMH  - *Social PerceptionMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2011/06/11 06:00MHDA- 2011/07/12 06:00CRDT- 2011/06/11 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Sport Exerc Psychol. 2011 Jun;33(3):394-415.PMID- 21658551OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20110610DCOM- 20111104IS  - 1556-228X (Electronic)IS  - 0278-5919 (Linking)VI  - 30IP  - 3DP  - 2011 JulTI  - Psychiatric and neuropsychological issues in sports medicine.PG  - 611-27LID - 10.1016/j.csm.2011.03.002 [doi]AB  - This article reviews psychiatric/psychological issues in the athletic training      room, including recognition of these issues and a framework for management.

Current trends indicate that widespread participation in organized      youth sports is occurring at a younger age, especially in girls. Current public      health recommendations developed to promote muscle strengthening and bone      building activities for youth aged 6 yr and older, along with increased      involvement in competitive sport activities at younger ages, has increased      interest and concern from parents, clinicians, coaches, and teachers regarding      the optimal age to encourage and integrate more specialized physical training      into youth development programs. This review synthesizes the latest literature      and expert opinion regarding when to initiate neuromuscular conditioning in youth      and presents a how-to integrative training conceptual model that could maximize      the potential health-related benefits for children by reducing sports-related      injury risk and encouraging lifelong, regular physical activity.FAU - Myer, Gregory DAU  - Myer GDAD  - Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Sports Medicine Biodynamics Center      and Human Performance Laboratory, 3333 Burnet Avenue, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA.       greg.myer@cchmc.orgFAU - Faigenbaum, Avery DAU  - Faigenbaum ADFAU - Ford, Kevin RAU  - Ford KRFAU - Best, Thomas MAU  - Best TMFAU - Bergeron, Michael FAU  - Bergeron MFFAU - Hewett, Timothy EAU  - Hewett TELA  - engGR  - R01 AR049735/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 AR049735-01A2/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 AR049735-01A2S1/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 AR049735-02/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 AR049735-03/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 AR049735-04/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 AR049735-05/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 AR055563/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 AR055563-01A1/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 AR055563-02/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 AR055563-02S1/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 AR055563-03/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 AR055563-04/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 AR056259/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 AR056259-01A1/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 AR056259-02/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 AR056259-03/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01-AR049735/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01-AR055563/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01-AR056259/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralPT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Curr Sports Med RepJT  - Current sports medicine reportsJID - 101134380SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Aging/physiologyMH  - Athletic Injuries/*prevention & controlMH  - ChildMH  - HumansMH  - Motor Skills/physiologyMH  - Physical Education and Training/*methodsMH  - Physical Fitness/physiologyMH  - Sex FactorsPMC - PMC3105332MID - NIHMS289927OID - NLM: NIHMS289927OID - NLM: PMC3105332EDAT- 2011/05/31 06:00MHDA- 2011/09/29 06:00CRDT- 2011/05/31 06:00AID - 10.1249/JSR.0b013e31821b1442 [doi]AID - 00149619-201105000-00012 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Curr Sports Med Rep. 2011 May-Jun;10(3):155-66. doi:      10.1249/JSR.0b013e31821b1442.PMID- 21584912OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20110517DCOM- 20110912IS  - 1099-0968 (Electronic)IS  - 1072-4133 (Linking)VI  - 19IP  - 3DP  - 2011 May-JunTI  - Eating disordered behaviours in Portuguese athletes: the influence of personal,      sport, and psychological variables.PG  - 190-200LID - 10.1002/erv.1113 [doi]AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study describes eating disordered behaviours in a sample of      Portuguese elite athletes and analyses the impact of personal and sports factors       on those eating disordered behaviours. METHOD: Two hundred and ninety athletes      (51.7% males) practicing collective (64.8%) and individual sports have been      included. The evaluation protocol included the Eating Disorder Examination      Questionnaire; the Sport Condition Questionnaire; the Sport Anxiety Scale; the      Task and Ego Orientation in Sport Questionnaire; the Cognitive Evaluation of      Sport-Threat Perceptions and the Self-Presentation Exercise Questionnaire.      RESULTS: Females, athletes with a higher body mass index, and those with a desire      to weigh less, reported more eating disordered behaviours. No relation with      sports variables was found. Finally, a higher prevalence of eating disorders      behaviour was predicted by lower satisfaction in terms of body shape and physical      appearance, higher anxiety and impression motivation. CONCLUSION: Personal      characteristics of athletes, as well as their body satisfaction, anxiety,      impression motivation and threat perception and coach comments on their weight,      represent dimensions that could raise the risk for eating disorders.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and Eating Disorders Association.FAU - Gomes, A RuiAU  - Gomes ARAD  - University of Minho, Portugal. rgomes@psi.uminho.ptFAU - Martins, CarlaAU  - Martins CFAU - Silva, LuizAU  - Silva LLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - EnglandTA  - Eur Eat Disord RevJT  - European eating disorders review : the journal of the Eating Disorders      AssociationJID - 9436977SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - Anxiety/psychologyMH  - Athletes/*psychologyMH  - Body ImageMH  - Body Mass IndexMH  - Eating Disorders/*psychologyMH  - Feeding Behavior/*psychologyMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - PortugalMH  - Psychiatric Status Rating ScalesMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Sports/*psychologyEDAT- 2011/05/18 06:00MHDA- 2011/09/13 06:00CRDT- 2011/05/18 06:00AID - 10.1002/erv.1113 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur Eat Disord Rev. 2011 May-Jun;19(3):190-200. doi: 10.1002/erv.1113.PMID- 21558583OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20110511DCOM- 20110621IS  - 0895-2779 (Print)IS  - 0895-2779 (Linking)VI  - 33IP  - 2DP  - 2011 AprTI  - Antecedents of perceived coach autonomy supportive and controlling behaviors:      coach psychological need satisfaction and well-being.PG  - 255-72AB  - Within the self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 2000) framework, research has       considered the consequences of coaches' autonomy supportive and controlling      behaviors on various athlete outcomes (e.g., motivation and performance). The      antecedents of such behaviors, however, have received little attention. Coaches      (N = 443) from a variety of sports and competitive levels completed a self-report      questionnaire to assess their psychological need satisfaction, well-being and      perceived interpersonal behaviors toward their athletes. Structural equation      modeling demonstrated that coaches' competence and autonomy need satisfaction      positively predicted their levels of psychological well-being, as indexed by      positive affect and subjective vitality. In turn, coaches' psychological      well-being positively predicted their perceived autonomy support toward their      athletes, and negatively predicted their perceived controlling behaviors.      Overall, the results highlight the importance of coaching contexts that      facilitate coaches' psychological need satisfaction and well-being, thereby      increasing the likelihood of adaptive coach interpersonal behavior toward      athletes.FAU - Stebbings, JulietteAU  - Stebbings JAD  - School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences, Loughborough University,      Leicestershire, United Kingdom.FAU - Taylor, Ian MAU  - Taylor IMFAU - Spray, Christopher MAU  - Spray CMLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Sport Exerc PsycholJT  - Journal of sport & exercise psychologyJID - 8809258SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - *Athletic PerformanceMH  - Competitive BehaviorMH  - FemaleMH  - HappinessMH  - HumansMH  - *Interpersonal RelationsMH  - *Job SatisfactionMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Models, PsychologicalMH  - *MotivationMH  - *Personal AutonomyMH  - *Physical Education and TrainingMH  - PleasureMH  - *Social Control, FormalMH  - Social EnvironmentMH  - *Social SupportMH  - Sports/*psychologyMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2011/05/12 06:00MHDA- 2011/06/22 06:00CRDT- 2011/05/12 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Sport Exerc Psychol. 2011 Apr;33(2):255-72.PMID- 21505079OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20110603DCOM- 20111024LR  - 20141120IS  - 1552-3365 (Electronic)IS  - 0363-5465 (Linking)VI  - 39IP  - 6DP  - 2011 JunTI  - Sports hernia: diagnosis and treatment highlighting a minimal repair surgical      technique.PG  - 1341-9LID - 10.1177/0363546511402807 [doi]AB  - Groin injuries are a common occurrence in elite-level athletes. These injuries      can cause significant pain and disability, leading to prolonged periods of      inactivity and consternation among athletes, coaches, athletic trainers, and      physicians alike. The differential diagnosis for groin pain is vast and spans      multiple disciplines, including orthopaedics, general surgery, urology,      gynecology, and neurology. Sports hernias are one cause of chronic groin pain in       athletes and are distinct entities from classic hernias. They are often caused by      a deficient posterior wall of the inguinal canal, but may also involve concurrent      injuries, such as conjoint and adductor tendinopathies and nerve entrapment.      Understanding the complex lower abdominal, pelvic, and hip anatomy and      pathophysiology of sports hernias is crucial to making an accurate diagnosis and       providing appropriate treatment options.

Most studies examining these issues      have had weak methodology. However, results from this review indicate that a high      proportion of athletes are using extreme weight-control methods and that the      rules of some sports might be associated with the risk of continuous dieting,      energy deficit, and/or use of extreme weight-loss methods that can be detrimental      to health and performance. Thus, preventive strategies are justified for medical       as well as performance reasons. The most urgent needs are: (1) to develop      sport-specific educational programmes for athletic trainers, coaches, and      athletes; (2) modifications to regulations; and (3) research related to minimum      percentage body fat and judging patterns.FAU - Sundgot-Borgen, JorunnAU  - Sundgot-Borgen JAD  - Department of Sports Medicine, Norwegian School of Sport Sciences, Oslo, Norway.       jorunn.sundgot-borgen@nih.noFAU - Garthe, InaAU  - Garthe ILA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20110524PL  - EnglandTA  - J Sports SciJT  - Journal of sports sciencesJID - 8405364SB  - IMMH  - *Adipose TissueMH  - Athletic PerformanceMH  - *Body CompositionMH  - *Body WeightMH  - *Diet/standardsMH  - Diet, ReducingMH  - *Energy IntakeMH  - Energy MetabolismMH  - EstheticsMH  - Health EducationMH  - HumansMH  - *Nutritional StatusMH  - *SportsMH  - ThinnessMH  - Weight LossEDAT- 2011/04/19 06:00MHDA- 2012/05/26 06:00CRDT- 2011/04/19 06:00PHST- 2011/05/24 [aheadofprint]AID - 936417768 [pii]AID - 10.1080/02640414.2011.565783 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Sci. 2011;29 Suppl 1:S101-14. doi: 10.1080/02640414.2011.565783.

METHODS: The      literature was reviewed regarding sports-related eye injuries and prevention of      these injuries. RESULTS: The review of the literature suggests that ocular sports      injuries can occur with all sports and affects all ages. These injuries may      affect professional athletes and amateur athletes around the world. There are      between 40,000 and 600,000 documented sports-related ocular injuries in the      United States every year. More than 90% of these ocular injuries from sports are       preventable. CONCLUSIONS: Most of sports-related eye injuries are preventable.      Increased recognition of the risks of eye injury playing sports may lead to      improved protection and a decreased morbidity from eye injuries. To help prevent       sports-related eye injuries, education of athletes, parents, coaches, trainers,      referees, and health care practitioners is critical.FAU - Goldstein, Michael HAU  - Goldstein MHAD  - From the Department of Ophthalmology, Tufts University School of Medicine, New      England Eye Center, Boston, MA.FAU - Wee, DanielAU  - Wee DLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Eye Contact LensJT  - Eye & contact lensJID - 101160941SB  - IMMH  - Athletic Injuries/epidemiology/*prevention & controlMH  - Eye Injuries/epidemiology/*prevention & controlMH  - *Eye Protective DevicesMH  - HumansMH  - United States/epidemiologyEDAT- 2011/04/08 06:00MHDA- 2015/01/07 06:00CRDT- 2011/04/08 06:00AID - 10.1097/ICL.0b013e31821790db [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eye Contact Lens. 2011 May;37(3):160-3. doi: 10.1097/ICL.0b013e31821790db.PMID- 21462691OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20110405DCOM- 20110525IS  - 0270-1367 (Print)IS  - 0270-1367 (Linking)VI  - 82IP  - 1DP  - 2011 MarTI  - Where are the women in women's sports? Predictors of female athletes' interest in      a coaching career.PG  - 109-17AB  - In this study, we used social cognitive career theory (Lent, Brown, & Hackett,      1994) to examine the development of female athletes' career interest in coaching       and, specifically, the impact of contextual factors (female coaching role models,      working hours, and perceived discrimination) on coaching self-efficacy and      outcome expectations. Participants were 205 predominantly White, heterosexual      female student athletes. A path analysis indicated that role models and working      hours predicted coaching self-efficacy, which predicted coaching outcome      expectations. Additionally, coaching self-efficacy, coaching outcome      expectations, and contextual factors predicted coaching interest.

Within Bass's (1985)      transformational leadership framework, we examined follower narcissism as a      moderator of the coach behavior-coach effectiveness relationship. Youth athletes       (male = 103, female = 106) from the Singapore Sports Academy (mean age = 14.28,      SD = 1.40 years) completed the Differentiated Transformational Leadership      Inventory (Callow, Smith, Hardy, Arthur, & Hardy, 2009), the Narcissistic      Personality Inventory (Raskin & Terry, 1988), and indices of follower effort.      Multilevel analyses revealed that athlete narcissism moderated the relationship      between fostering acceptance of group goals and athlete effort and between high      performance expectations and athlete effort. All the other transformational      leader behaviors demonstrated main effects on follower effort, except for      inspirational motivation.FAU - Arthur, Calum AlexanderAU  - Arthur CAAD  - School of Sport Health and Exercise Sciences, Bangor University, Bangor, Gwynedd,      United Kingdom.FAU - Woodman, TimAU  - Woodman TFAU - Ong, Chin WeiAU  - Ong CWFAU - Hardy, LewAU  - Hardy LFAU - Ntoumanis, NikosAU  - Ntoumanis NLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Sport Exerc PsycholJT  - Journal of sport & exercise psychologyJID - 8809258SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - *Athletic PerformanceMH  - FemaleMH  - Group ProcessesMH  - HumansMH  - *LeadershipMH  - MaleMH  - *MotivationMH  - Multivariate AnalysisMH  - *NarcissismMH  - PersonalityMH  - SingaporeMH  - Sports/*psychologyMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2011/04/01 06:00MHDA- 2011/04/27 06:00CRDT- 2011/04/01 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Sport Exerc Psychol. 2011 Feb;33(1):3-19.PMID- 21425889OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20110323DCOM- 20110711LR  - 20130516IS  - 1179-2035 (Electronic)IS  - 0112-1642 (Linking)VI  - 41IP  - 4DP  - 2011 Apr 1TI  - Interactive processes link the multiple symptoms of fatigue in sport competition.PG  - 307-28LID - 10.2165/11586070-000000000-00000 [doi]AB  - Muscle physiologists often describe fatigue simply as a decline of muscle force      and infer this causes an athlete to slow down. In contrast, exercise scientists      describe fatigue during sport competition more holistically as an      exercise-induced impairment of performance. The aim of this review is to      reconcile the different views by evaluating the many performance      symptoms/measures and mechanisms of fatigue. We describe how fatigue is assessed       with muscle, exercise or competition performance measures. Muscle performance      (single muscle test measures) declines due to peripheral fatigue (reduced muscle       cell force) and/or central fatigue (reduced motor drive from the CNS). Peak      muscle force seldom falls by >30% during sport but is often exacerbated during      electrical stimulation and laboratory exercise tasks. Exercise performance      (whole-body exercise test measures) reveals impaired physical/technical abilities      and subjective fatigue sensations. Exercise intensity is initially sustained by      recruitment of new motor units and help from synergistic muscles before it      declines. Technique/motor skill execution deviates as exercise proceeds to      maintain outcomes before they deteriorate, e.g. reduced accuracy or velocity. The      sensation of fatigue incorporates an elevated rating of perceived exertion (RPE)       during submaximal tasks, due to a combination of peripheral and higher CNS      inputs. Competition performance (sport symptoms) is affected more by      decision-making and psychological aspects, since there are opponents and a      greater importance on the result. Laboratory based decision making is generally      faster or unimpaired. Motivation, self-efficacy and anxiety can change during      exercise to modify RPE and, hence, alter physical performance. Symptoms of      fatigue during racing, team-game or racquet sports are largely anecdotal, but      sometimes assessed with time-motion analysis. Fatigue during brief all-out racing      is described biomechanically as a decline of peak velocity, along with altered      kinematic components. Longer sport events involve pacing strategies, central and       peripheral fatigue contributions and elevated RPE. During match play, the work      rate can decline late in a match (or tournament) and/or transiently after intense      exercise bursts. Repeated sprint ability, agility and leg strength become      slightly impaired. Technique outcomes, such as velocity and accuracy for      throwing, passing, hitting and kicking, can deteriorate. Physical and subjective       changes are both less severe in real rather than simulated sport activities.      Little objective evidence exists to support exercise-induced mental lapses during      sport. A model depicting mind-body interactions during sport competition shows      that the RPE centre-motor cortex-working muscle sequence drives overall      performance levels and, hence, fatigue symptoms. The sporting outputs from this      sequence can be modulated by interactions with muscle afferent and circulatory      feedback, psychological and decision-making inputs. Importantly, compensatory      processes exist at many levels to protect against performance decrements. Small      changes of putative fatigue factors can also be protective. We show that      individual fatigue factors including diminished carbohydrate availability,      elevated serotonin, hypoxia, acidosis, hyperkalaemia, hyperthermia, dehydration      and reactive oxygen species, each contribute to several fatigue symptoms. Thus,      multiple symptoms of fatigue can occur simultaneously and the underlying      mechanisms overlap and interact. Based on this understanding, we reinforce the      proposal that fatigue is best described globally as an exercise-induced decline      of performance as this is inclusive of all viewpoints.CI  - (c) 2011 Adis Data Information BV.

First, we investigate the influence of the       parent-initiated motivational climate upon elite junior athletes' perfectionistic      cognitions. Second, we examine whether the coach-created motivational climate      predicts additional variance in elite junior athletes' perfectionistic cognitions      beyond the effects associated with the parent-initiated motivational climate.      Third, we test the moderating role of athletes' gender and age in the      relationship between the parent-initiated and coach-created motivational climates      and athletes' perfectionistic cognitions. A total of 190 elite junior athletes      (mean age 15.2 years, s = 1.5, range 10-18) completed the Parent-Initiated      Motivational Climate Questionnaire-2 (White & Duda, 1993), the Perceived      Motivational Climate in Sport Questionnaire-2 (Newton, Duda, & Yin, 2000), and      the Perfectionistic Cognitions Inventory (Flett, Hewitt, Blankstein, & Gray,      1998). Regression analyses revealed that mother- and father-initiated      worry-conducive climates, the father-initiated success-without-effort climate,      and the coach-created performance motivational climate predicted male athletes'      perfectionistic cognitions. Female athletes' perfectionistic cognitions were      predicted by the mother-initiated worry-conducive climate, father-initiated      learning-enjoyment climate, and both dimensions of the coach-created climate.      Finally, athletes' gender emerged as a significant moderator of the      mother-initiated worry-conducive climate and athletes' perfectionistic cognitions      relationship. Findings confirm that the parent-initiated motivational climate is       a significant predictor of athletes' perfectionism-related thoughts, and provide       initial support for the influence of the coach-created motivation climate over      children's perfectionistic cognitions.FAU - Appleton, Paul RAU  - Appleton PRAD  - School of Sport and Exercise Sciences, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston,      Birmingham, UK. p.appleton@bham.ac.ukFAU - Hall, Howard KAU  - Hall HKFAU - Hill, Andrew PAU  - Hill APLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - EnglandTA  - J Sports SciJT  - Journal of sports sciencesJID - 8405364SB  - IMMH  - *AchievementMH  - AdolescentMH  - Athletes/*psychologyMH  - Athletic Performance/psychologyMH  - ChildMH  - *CognitionMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - *MotivationMH  - *Parent-Child RelationsMH  - ParentsMH  - *Physical Education and TrainingMH  - Psychology, AdolescentMH  - Psychology, ChildMH  - *Self ConceptMH  - Sex FactorsEDAT- 2011/03/19 06:00MHDA- 2011/11/01 06:00CRDT- 2011/03/19 06:00AID - 935028542 [pii]AID - 10.1080/02640414.2010.551541 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Sci. 2011 Apr;29(7):661-71. doi: 10.1080/02640414.2010.551541.PMID- 21410540OWN - NLMSTAT- In-ProcessDA  - 20120723IS  - 1600-0838 (Electronic)IS  - 0905-7188 (Linking)VI  - 22IP  - 4DP  - 2012 AugTI  - Influences of coaches, parents, and peers on the motivational patterns of child      and adolescent athletes.PG  - 558-68LID - 10.1111/j.1600-0838.2010.01277.x [doi]AB  - The purposes of this study were to assess the relative impact of social      influences initiated by coach, parents, and peers on children and adolescent      athletes' motivational patterns, involving self-rated effort, enjoyment,      competence, and competitive trait anxiety. Questionnaire data were collected from      408 youth swimmers (aged 9-18 years). Results of multi-group structural equation       modeling analyses generally showed that compared with athletes in the other age      group, the social influence from mother was stronger in childhood (mean age=10.87      years; SD=1.00), and that from peers was greater in adolescence (mean age=16.32      years; SD=1.15). The social influence from coach was more influential for      athletes' effort and enjoyment in childhood, and competence in adolescence. We      concluded that age appeared to moderate the impact of social influence from      significant others on young athletes' sport experiences.CI  - (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.FAU - Chan, D KAU  - Chan DKAD  - Personality, Social Psychology, and Health Research Group, School of Psychology,       University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.FAU - Lonsdale, CAU  - Lonsdale CFAU - Fung, H HAU  - Fung HHLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20110316PL  - DenmarkTA  - Scand J Med Sci SportsJT  - Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sportsJID - 9111504SB  - IMEDAT- 2011/03/18 06:00MHDA- 2011/03/18 06:00CRDT- 2011/03/18 06:00PHST- 2011/03/16 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1111/j.1600-0838.2010.01277.x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Scand J Med Sci Sports. 2012 Aug;22(4):558-68. doi:      10.1111/j.1600-0838.2010.01277.x.

The aim here was to investigate the possibility of an      association of computers and video games or sports (team, individual) with      psychiatric disorders among underage psychiatric inpatients. The series of      adolescents (n = 508) had been diagnosed using semistructured interviews      (K-SADS-PL). The results showed that an interest in computers and video games did      not increase the risk of any specific psychiatric disorder among these adolescent      inpatients, but the likelihood of a substance-related disorder was statistically       significantly lower among the boys with computers as a hobby. Team sports were      related to increased likelihood of conduct disorder among the boys, whereas the      likelihood of an affective disorder was reduced. No such association was found in      individual sports or among the girls. We conclude that social contacts and peers       play an important role in preventing adolescent depression.FAU - Harju, OutiAU  - Harju OAD  - Institute of Clinical Medicine/Psychiatry, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland.FAU - Luukkonen, Anu-HelmiAU  - Luukkonen AHFAU - Hakko, HelinaAU  - Hakko HFAU - Rasanen, PirkkoAU  - Rasanen PFAU - Riala, KaisaAU  - Riala KLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20110202PL  - United StatesTA  - Cyberpsychol Behav Soc NetwJT  - Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networkingJID - 101528721SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Adolescent Behavior/*psychologyMH  - ChildMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - *InternetMH  - Leisure ActivitiesMH  - MaleMH  - Mental Disorders/*psychologyMH  - Sex FactorsMH  - Sports/*psychologyMH  - Video Games/*psychologyEDAT- 2011/02/04 06:00MHDA- 2011/12/13 00:00CRDT- 2011/02/04 06:00PHST- 2011/02/02 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1089/cyber.2010.0193 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Cyberpsychol Behav Soc Netw. 2011 Jul-Aug;14(7-8):461-5. doi:      10.1089/cyber.2010.0193.

The first study tested the construct validity of the Coaching Behavior      Questionnaire (CBQ) in the Greek language, and provided support for its original       factor structure. The second study examined the relationships between coaching      behavior and athletes' ST in field, with two different samples. The results      showed that supportive coaching behavior was positively related to positive ST      (in one sample) and negatively related to negative ST (in both samples), whereas       negative coaching behavior was negatively related to positive ST (in one sample)       and positively related to negative ST (in both samples). Finally, the third study      examined the relationships experimentally, to produce evidence regarding the      direction of causality. The results showed that variations in coaching behavior      affected participants' ST. Overall, the results of the present investigation      provided considerable evidence regarding the links between coaching behavior and       athletes' ST and suggested that coaches may have an impact on athletes' thoughts.FAU - Zourbanos, NikosAU  - Zourbanos NAD  - Department of Physical Education and Sport Science, University of Thessaly,      Trikala, Greece.FAU - Hatzigeorgiadis, AntonisAU  - Hatzigeorgiadis AFAU - Tsiakaras, NikosAU  - Tsiakaras NFAU - Chroni, StilianiAU  - Chroni SFAU - Theodorakis, YannisAU  - Theodorakis YLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - United StatesTA  - J Sport Exerc PsycholJT  - Journal of sport & exercise psychologyJID - 8809258SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - Analysis of VarianceMH  - Athletes/*psychologyMH  - Athletic Performance/psychologyMH  - Competitive Behavior/physiologyMH  - FemaleMH  - GreeceMH  - HumansMH  - Internal-External ControlMH  - *Interpersonal RelationsMH  - *LeadershipMH  - MaleMH  - Motivation/*physiologyMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - *Social BehaviorMH  - Social SupportMH  - Sports/*psychologyMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2011/02/02 06:00MHDA- 2011/06/04 06:00CRDT- 2011/02/02 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Sport Exerc Psychol. 2010 Dec;32(6):764-85.PMID- 21268475OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20110127DCOM- 20110224IS  - 0270-1367 (Print)IS  - 0270-1367 (Linking)VI  - 81IP  - 4DP  - 2010 DecTI  - Bearing the burden of doubt: female coaches' experiences of gender relations.PG  - 506-17AB  - Based on interview research, this study examined how master female coaches based       in the United Kingdom experienced relations with men within their profession.      Using a feminist cultural studies approach to examine how sport promotes and      maintains a gender order unfavorable to women, we found that female coaches felt       the need to continually prove themselves and often experienced coaching as a      hostile and intimidating culture. Participants reported a gradual reduction in      such unwelcoming behavior from men, seemingly because they had proved to be no      threat to the existing patriarchal structure. A critical exploration of coaching       is needed to understand how masculine hegemony leads to women's relative      powerlessness as coaches. Furthermore, the findings present a case for a greater       emphasis on sociocultural education within the UK coaching curricula.FAU - Norman, LeanneAU  - Norman LAD  - Carnegie Faculty at Leeds Metropolitan University, UK.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the rate and risk of      ACL injury among Slovenian sportswomen playing professional basketball, team      handball, or volleyball. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: The Slovenian      National Organizations of basketball, team handball, and volleyball. PATIENTS OR       OTHER PARTICIPANTS: During the 2003-2004 season, we prospectively followed 585      Slovenian sportswomen registered in the Slovenian National Organizations of      basketball, team handball, and volleyball. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): We asked      sportswomen and coaches to document the occurrence of every significant traumatic      knee injury requiring medical attention. Injury rate and injury risk were      calculated for sportswomen in each sport group. To calculate injury rate, we      estimated the average exposure of each sportswoman during the research period.      RESULTS: During the 2003-2004 season, 585 Slovenian sportswomen sustained 12 ACL       injuries. The ACL-injury risk was different in athletes participating in the      various sports, with basketball players having the greatest ACL-injury risk and      volleyball players having the lowest ACL-injury risk (P = .04). The risk of ACL      injury among Slovenian sportswomen was 2.1 per 100 athletes (95% confidence      interval = 0.9, 3.2), whereas the rate of ACL injury was 0.037 per 1000 exposure       hours (95% confidence interval = 0.016, 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Overall differences      in injury risk were found among sports, but no differences were noted among      divisions within sports. No differences for injury rate were observed between or       within sports. The rate and risk of ACL injury among Slovenian sportswomen are      high, with basketball players having the greatest ACL-injury risk.FAU - Vauhnik, RenataAU  - Vauhnik RAD  - Department of Physiotherapy, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Ljubljana,      Slovenia. r_vauhnik@yahoo.comFAU - Morrissey, Matthew CAU  - Morrissey MCFAU - Rutherford, Olga MAU  - Rutherford OMFAU - Turk, ZmagoAU  - Turk ZFAU - Pilih, Iztok AAU  - Pilih IAFAU - Perme, Maja PoharAU  - Perme MPLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Athl TrainJT  - Journal of athletic trainingJID - 9301647SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - Anterior Cruciate Ligament/*injuriesMH  - *AthletesMH  - Athletic Injuries/*epidemiologyMH  - BasketballMH  - Cohort StudiesMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - Knee Injuries/*epidemiologyMH  - Prospective StudiesMH  - RiskMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - SloveniaMH  - SportsMH  - VolleyballMH  - Young AdultPMC - PMC3017495OID - NLM: PMC3017495EDAT- 2011/01/11 06:00MHDA- 2011/04/22 06:00CRDT- 2011/01/11 06:00AID - 10.4085/1062-6050-46.1.92 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Athl Train. 2011 Jan-Feb;46(1):92-8. doi: 10.4085/1062-6050-46.1.92.PMID- 21200164OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20110104DCOM- 20110413IS  - 1536-3724 (Electronic)IS  - 1050-642X (Linking)VI  - 21IP  - 1DP  - 2011 JanTI  - Sports concussion and the risk of chronic neurological impairment.PG  - 6-12LID - 10.1097/JSM.0b013e318204db50 [doi]AB  - Intense recent media focus on long-term outcomes from sports concussion has      highlighted concerns on both cognitive deterioration and mental health issues,      such as depression and suicide. At this time, the scientific evidence to support       these views is limited, with only a handful of cases thus far reported. Based on       the literature on this topic that extends back over 50 years, it is clear that      only a small percentage of athletes suffer such sequelae presumably due to      recurrent concussive or subconcussive head impacts. At this stage, determining      which athletes are at future risk is not possible; however, following existing      concussion guidelines (eg, Zurich guidelines) is likely to be the safest option      based on current evidence.FAU - McCrory, PaulAU  - McCrory PAD  - Centre for Health, Exercise and Sports Medicine, University of Melbourne,      Parkville, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. paulmccr@bigpond.net.auLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Clin J Sport MedJT  - Clinical journal of sport medicine : official journal of the Canadian Academy of       Sport MedicineJID - 9103300SB  - IMMH  - Boxing/*injuriesMH  - Brain Concussion/*complicationsMH  - Brain Injury, Chronic/*etiology/prevention & controlMH  - Guidelines as TopicMH  - HumansMH  - RiskMH  - Safety ManagementEDAT- 2011/01/05 06:00MHDA- 2011/04/14 06:00CRDT- 2011/01/05 06:00AID - 10.1097/JSM.0b013e318204db50 [doi]AID - 00042752-201101000-00003 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Clin J Sport Med. 2011 Jan;21(1):6-12. doi: 10.1097/JSM.0b013e318204db50.PMID- 24150616OWN - NLMSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINEDA  - 20131023DCOM- 20131023LR  - 20140124IS  - 1303-2968 (Electronic)IS  - 1303-2968 (Linking)VI  - 10IP  - 3DP  - 2011TI  - Exploring the organizational effect of prenatal testosterone upon the sporting      brain.PG  - 445-51AB  - The 2D:4D ratio is a putative marker for prenatal testosterone and has the      potential to explain variations in sport performance. To date there has been      little research into the association between sporting performance, digit ratio      and psychological variables. This study examined the relationship between 2D:4D      and mental toughness, optimism, goal orientations, aggression, coping style and      their association with sporting achievement. A post facto design was adopted.      Participants consisted of an opportunity sample of 122 sports people: male (n      =60) and female (n = 62) from a university in North East England. Following      informed consent, a Vernier Caliper was used to measure digit ratio hand scans.      Participants completed self-reports measures including, the Alternative      Psychological Performance Inventory (Golby et al., 2008), Sport Mental Toughness       Questionnaire (Sheard et al., 2009), Life Orientation Test-Revised (Scheier et      al., 1994), Buss-Perry aggression (Buss-Perry, 1992) and 30 item coping style      questionnaire (Joseph et al., 1995). MANOVA revealed significant gender      differences in 2D:4D with males demonstrating lower ratios (Manning, 2002). The      2D:4D was found to differentiate eleven of the seventeen measured variables,      including mental toughness scores (p < 0.001) and varying levels of sporting      achievement i.e. international/national, regional and school levels (p< 0.001).      Specifically, this difference was significant when comparing the highest      (international/national) and lowest (leisure/school) groups. Perhaps there is a      threshold for prenatal testosterone's influence upon sporting ability. Further      research is necessary to examine the subtle differences between competitors      involved in different achievement levels. It is proposed that high prenatal      levels of testosterone may contribute to the development of increased mental      toughness, optimism, ego/task goal orientations in individuals, and hence      aptitude towards sport. Findings lend support for the tentative claim that mental      toughness may be partially biologically predetermined. Theoretical and practical       implications are considered, along with limitations of the current study. Key      pointsIncreased prenatal testosterone exposure was associated with successful      sport performance. There is a need to further consider psychological aspects      related to sport performance and their potential relationship with 2D:4D.Mental      toughness variables, optimism, goal orientation, hostility and coping style are      related to levels of 2:4D.Perhaps with further substantiation, 2D:4D could      provide a supporting objective measure, to complement existing psychometric      instruments.FAU - Golby, JimAU  - Golby JAD  - Department of Sport and Exercise Psychology, Teesside University , Middlesbrough,      England, United Kingdom.FAU - Meggs, JenniferAU  - Meggs JLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20110901PL  - TurkeyTA  - J Sports Sci MedJT  - Journal of sports science & medicineJID - 101174629PMC - PMC3737815OID - NLM: PMC3737815OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Digit ratioOT  - aggression.OT  - coping styleOT  - mental toughnessOT  - sport performanceEDAT- 2011/01/01 00:00MHDA- 2011/01/01 00:01CRDT- 2013/10/24 06:00PHST- 2011/09 [ecollection]PHST- 2010/07/27 [received]PHST- 2011/05/23 [accepted]PHST- 2011/09/01 [epublish]PST - epublishSO  - J Sports Sci Med. 2011 Sep 1;10(3):445-51. eCollection 2011.PMID- 24149314OWN - NLMSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINEDA  - 20131023DCOM- 20131023LR  - 20140124IS  - 1303-2968 (Electronic)IS  - 1303-2968 (Linking)VI  - 10IP  - 1DP  - 2011TI  - Handball coaches' perceptions about the value of working competences according to      their coaching background.PG  - 193-202AB  - The purpose of this study was to analyze the value attributed to given working      competences, by Portuguese handball coaches according to their coaching      background, certification level, coaching experience, and level of education. A      sample of 207 handball coaches responded to a questionnaire which included      demographic characteristics and a scale focused on perceptions of the level of      importance attributed to working competences. Data analysis included an      exploratory factorial analysis applying Maximum Likelihood Factoring (MLF) and      Oblimin rotation. These factors were submitted to a One-way ANOVA and Tukey's      post hoc multiple comparisons to analyse coaches' perceptions according to their       coaching background. A six factor solution was found where three major domains of      competences were highlighted; the first one related to training and competition      (e.g. planning and conducting the training, team administration in competition,      annual and multi-annual planning, and coaching methodology); the second one      related to social and cultural issues and management (e.g. implementation of      youth sport development projects, team leadership and coach education) and the      third one related to the cognitive background (meta-cognitive competences). The      importance ascribed to some working competences was influenced by their coaching       experience and certification level. Highly experienced and qualified coaches      perceived competences of everyday practice, social, cultural and management      issues related to training and competition as more important than the other      coaches. This study suggests the need to consider some working competences, until      now not explicitly present in the Portuguese coaching education curriculum which       could enable coaches to choose the best way to practice/work in a manner that      will foster and support their professional development. Key pointsThree major      domains of competences were highlighted by Portuguese handball coaches. The first      one related to training and competition, the second one related to social and      cultural issues and management and the third one related to the cognitive      background.The importance ascribed by Portuguese handball coaches to some working      competences was influenced by their coaching experience and certification level,       as high experienced coaches and coaches with higher certification levels      perceived competences related to training and competition of the everyday      practice and social, cultural issues and management as more important.The value      attributed by Portuguese handball coaches to working competences did not vary      according to the coaches' academic education level.Portuguese handball coaches      valued the meta-cognitive competences, the competences to implement sport      development project and related to annual and multi-annual planning independently      of their coaching background.FAU - Mesquita, IsabelAU  - Mesquita IAD  - Centre of Research, Education, Innovation and Intervention in Sport, University      of Porto, Sport Faculty , Portugal.FAU - Borges, MarioAU  - Borges MFAU - Rosado, AntonioAU  - Rosado AFAU - Souza, Adriano DeAU  - Souza ADLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20110301PL  - TurkeyTA  - J Sports Sci MedJT  - Journal of sports science & medicineJID - 101174629PMC - PMC3737886OID - NLM: PMC3737886OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Science of coachingOT  - coaching educationOT  - competencesOT  - handball coachesEDAT- 2011/01/01 00:00MHDA- 2011/01/01 00:01CRDT- 2013/10/24 06:00PHST- 2011/03 [ecollection]PHST- 2010/04/28 [received]PHST- 2010/12/23 [accepted]PHST- 2011/03/01 [epublish]PST - epublishSO  - J Sports Sci Med. 2011 Mar 1;10(1):193-202. eCollection 2011.PMID- 24149289OWN - NLMSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINEDA  - 20131023DCOM- 20131023LR  - 20140124IS  - 1303-2968 (Electronic)IS  - 1303-2968 (Linking)VI  - 10IP  - 1DP  - 2011TI  - Review of rule modification in sport.PG  - 1-8AB  - The goal of this qualitative review was to analyze the state of the bibliography       about rule modification in sport. In the literature reviewed, there are few      studies of rule modification and related aspects. Most studies omit mentioning      the purpose of the modifications, but they do refer to the goals of their      analysis (improving players' performance, attracting spectators and athletes,      attending to commercial pressure, adapting the sport to children's needs and      interests, preventing injuries). Eighty percent of the studies did not report the      outcome of the previous modifications they analyzed. More than half of the      studies (60%) achieved the proposed goals. Nearly two-thirds (63.83%) analyzed      the effect of rule modification on game actions occurring during the game or      through a test. Most of the studies (91.5%) did not consult the participants.      Three-fourths of the studies (74.46%) examined the effect of rule modification      without any knowledge of a previous analysis or without any previous analysis,      and 74.47% studied rule modification related to internal logic. Modifications to       be introduced in a sport should be analyzed through a reflective process before      their final introduction. The following points should be considered: establishing      goals, respecting the basic rules without modifying them, becoming familiar with       players' and coaches' opinions, determining the effect of the modification on a      wide spectrum of variables, elaborating useful proposals for the organizations      that are responsible for competitions, using more than one type of data,      modifying the internal logic and, preferably, the functional rules, and following      some basic stages to consolidate rule modification. Key pointsRule modification      involves processes that seek change in the game conditions with a certain goal in      mind.The rules related to internal logic model the game actions that are      characteristic of a sport.Functional rules facilitate achieving the goals.There      are few valid research studies on which to base the modifications.Modifications      in a sport should be validated after a reflective process before they are      introduced.FAU - Arias, Jose LAU  - Arias JLAD  - Department of Physical Activity and Sport Sciences, Catholic University of San      Antonio , Murcia, Spain.FAU - Argudo, Francisco MAU  - Argudo FMFAU - Alonso, Jose IAU  - Alonso JILA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20110301PL  - TurkeyTA  - J Sports Sci MedJT  - Journal of sports science & medicineJID - 101174629PMC - PMC3737911OID - NLM: PMC3737911OTO - NOTNLMOT  - RuleOT  - economic interestOT  - gameOT  - game actionOT  - game analysisOT  - injury preventionEDAT- 2011/01/01 00:00MHDA- 2011/01/01 00:01CRDT- 2013/10/24 06:00PHST- 2011/03 [ecollection]PHST- 2010/09/13 [received]PHST- 2010/11/29 [accepted]PHST- 2011/03/01 [epublish]PST - epublishSO  - J Sports Sci Med. 2011 Mar 1;10(1):1-8. eCollection 2011.PMID- 21184342OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20110124DCOM- 20110718IS  - 1466-447X (Electronic)IS  - 0264-0414 (Linking)VI  - 29IP  - 4DP  - 2011 FebTI  - Coaching competency and satisfaction with the coach: a multi-level structural      equation model.PG  - 411-22LID - 10.1080/02640414.2010.538710 [doi]AB  - The purpose of this initial predictive validity study was to determine the      ability of measures derived from the Athletes' Perceptions of Coaching Competency      Scale II - High School Teams (APCCS II-HST) to predict satisfaction with the head      coach. Specification of the statistical model was informed by the mediational      model of coach-athlete interactions. The technical quality of the satisfaction      measure was evaluated before testing the predictive validity of the coaching      competency measures. Data were collected from athletes of seven sports. Athlete      observations (N = 748) were clustered within teams (G = 74). Multi-group      confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) provided evidence for factorial invariance of       a reduced version of the satisfaction measure by athlete gender. Multi-level CFA       provided evidence of model-data consistency for a reduced version of the      satisfaction measure. Multi-level structural equation modelling provided evidence      for the ability of latent coaching competency to positively predict latent      satisfaction at both the athlete level (technique competency and motivation      competency) and the team level (coaching competency) and for close model-data      fit. Implications of this study include: that the APCCS II-HST should be viewed      as a replacement for the Coaching Competency Scale when the intended population      is appropriate; a preliminary multi-level measurement model for satisfaction with      one's coach that should be considered as a potential starting point in subsequent      studies; and empirical support for a key relationship proposed in the mediational      model of coach-athlete interactions.FAU - Myers, Nicholas DAU  - Myers NDAD  - Department of Educational and Psychological Studies, University of Miami, Coral      Gables, Florida 33124-2040, USA. nmyers@miami.eduFAU - Beauchamp, Mark RAU  - Beauchamp MRFAU - Chase, Melissa AAU  - Chase MALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Validation StudiesPL  - EnglandTA  - J Sports SciJT  - Journal of sports sciencesJID - 8405364SB  - IMMH  - Athletes/*psychologyMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - *Interpersonal RelationsMH  - MaleMH  - Models, StatisticalMH  - *Personal SatisfactionMH  - *Physical Education and TrainingMH  - *Professional CompetenceMH  - Sex FactorsMH  - *SportsEDAT- 2010/12/25 06:00MHDA- 2011/07/19 06:00CRDT- 2010/12/25 06:00AID - 931516395 [pii]AID - 10.1080/02640414.2010.538710 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Sci. 2011 Feb;29(4):411-22. doi: 10.1080/02640414.2010.538710.PMID- 21144030OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20110111DCOM- 20110408LR  - 20140821IS  - 1471-2474 (Electronic)IS  - 1471-2474 (Linking)VI  - 11DP  - 2010TI  - Efficacy of a 3 month training program on the jump-landing technique in      jump-landing sports. Design of a cluster randomized controlled trial.PG  - 281LID - 10.1186/1471-2474-11-281 [doi]AB  - BACKGROUND: With the relatively high rate of injuries to the lower extremity due       to jump-landing movement patterns and the accompanied high costs, there is need      for determining potential preventive programs. A program on the intervention of      jump-landing technique is possibly an important preventative measure since it      appeared to reduce the incidence of lower extremity injuries. In real life      situations, amateur sports lack the infrastructure and funds to have a sports      physician or therapist permanently supervising such a program. Therefore the      current prevention program is designed so that it could be implemented by coaches      alone. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this randomized controlled trial is to      evaluate the effect of a coach supervised intervention program targeting      jump-landing technique on the incidence of lower extremity injuries. METHODS: Of       the 110 Flemish teams of the elite division, 24 teams are included and equally      randomized to two study groups. An equal selection of female and male teams with       allocation to intervention and control group is obtained. The program is a      modification of other prevention programs previously proven to be effective. All       exercises in the current program are adjusted so that a more progressive      development in the exercise is presented. Both the control and intervention group      continue with their normal training routine, while the intervention group carries      out the program on jump-landing technique. The full intervention program has a      duration of three months and is performed 2 times a week during warm-up (5-10      min). Injuries are registered during the entire season.

The sample consisted of 320 Italian youths      (160 girls and 160 boys) aged 13-14 years who were involved in individual or team      sports. The assessment included a perceived competence scale, a goal orientation       questionnaire, a motivational climate inventory, and pleasant psychobiosocial      descriptors. An actual competence scale was also administered to coaches asking      them to assess their youngsters. Moderated hierarchical regression analysis      showed that perceived competence, actual competence, and task orientation were      the strongest predictors of pleasant psychobiosocial states. Moreover, actual      competence and perceived competence interacted in different ways with      dispositional goal orientations and motivational climate perceptions in the      prediction of psychobiosocial states. It is therefore recommended that both      constructs be included in motivational research.FAU - Bortoli, LauraAU  - Bortoli LAD  - Faculty of Human Movement Science, BIND - Behavioral Imaging and Neural Dynamics       Center, University "G. d'Annunzio", Chieti, Italy.FAU - Bertollo, MaurizioAU  - Bertollo MFAU - Comani, SilviaAU  - Comani SFAU - Robazza, ClaudioAU  - Robazza CLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - EnglandTA  - J Sports SciJT  - Journal of sports sciencesJID - 8405364SB  - IMMH  - *AchievementMH  - AdolescentMH  - Athletes/*psychologyMH  - Athletic PerformanceMH  - CognitionMH  - CommunicationMH  - EgoMH  - EmotionsMH  - FemaleMH  - *GoalsMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - *PersonalityMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Regression AnalysisMH  - *Self ConceptMH  - Self EfficacyMH  - Sports/*psychologyEDAT- 2010/11/30 06:00MHDA- 2011/06/01 06:00CRDT- 2010/11/30 06:00AID - 930191357 [pii]AID - 10.1080/02640414.2010.530675 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Sci. 2011 Jan;29(2):171-80. doi: 10.1080/02640414.2010.530675.PMID- 21074089OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20101115DCOM- 20110307LR  - 20140821IS  - 1556-228X (Electronic)IS  - 0278-5919 (Linking)VI  - 30IP  - 1DP  - 2011 JanTI  - Helmets and mouth guards: the role of personal equipment in preventing      sport-related concussions.PG  - 145-63, xLID - 10.1016/j.csm.2010.09.006 [doi]AB  - Millions of athletes in the United States experience concussions annually.      Although helmets and mouth guards have decreased the risk of catastrophic head      injuries, their protective effects on concussions are less clear. This article      evaluates the current literature on the effect of equipment on concussions.      Understanding the role that these equipment play in preventing concussions is      complicated by many factors, such as selection bias in nonrandomized studies,      variations in playing style, and risk compensation in sports with mandatory      protective equipment. Improving coach and player education about proper      concussion management, encouraging neck-strengthening exercises, and minimizing      high-risk impacts may reduce concussions in sports.CI  - Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Research evidence strongly indicates that music has the ability to influence      psychological and physiological factors and can improve performance measures      significantly. Additionally, the nature of athlete's self-talk could possibly be       influenced through the use of 'digiprompts,' resulting in more focused and      productive training sessions. Research evidence also indicates a limited effect      on athlete adaptation during unsupervised training sessions related to decreased       training frequency and intensity. Coaches should always look for ways to enhance       their coaching, but new technologies and methodologies will only be widely      accepted if seen by the coaching community as readily accessible and able to      facilitate efficient improvement in coaching methodologies and athlete      development. With technological advances in music delivery systems and digital      editing, digital media and delivery systems for distance coaching should be      explored. This paper reviews several fields of research in an attempt to      highlight how the use of what is now common digital technology can create a      'surrogate coach.' Through the development of structured and specific digital      training aids, the effects of music as an ergogenic aid means the use of MP3      players seems a logical step forward for coaches, and unsupervised training could      potentially be made more effective.FAU - Harris, Ben AAU  - Harris BAAD  - Sports Coaching and Administration, Australian College of Physical Education      (ACPE), Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. ben.harris@efanational.comLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - J Strength Cond ResJT  - Journal of strength and conditioning research / National Strength & Conditioning       AssociationJID - 9415084SB  - IMMH  - *AthletesMH  - HumansMH  - *MP3-PlayerMH  - Physical Education and Training/*methodsMH  - *Sports/physiology/psychologyEDAT- 2010/11/12 06:00MHDA- 2011/03/25 06:00CRDT- 2010/11/12 06:00AID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181e38055 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Strength Cond Res. 2010 Dec;24(12):3507-19. doi: 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181e38055.PMID- 21068567OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20101111DCOM- 20110324IS  - 1537-8918 (Electronic)IS  - 1537-890X (Linking)VI  - 9IP  - 6DP  - 2010 Nov-DecTI  - Sickle cell trait in sports.PG  - 347-51LID - 10.1249/JSR.0b013e3181fc73d7 [doi]AB  - Sickle cell trait (SCT) can pose a grave risk for some athletes. In the past      decade in NCAA Division I football, no deaths have occurred from the play or      practice of the game, but 16 deaths have occurred from conditioning for the game,      and 10 (63%) of these deaths are tied to SCT, an excess of up to 21-fold.      Research shows how and why, during intense exercise bouts, sickle cells can      accumulate and "logjam" blood vessels, causing explosive rhabdomyolysis that can       kill. Sickling can begin in 2 to 5 min of all-out exertion and can reach grave      levels soon thereafter if the athlete struggles on or is urged on by coaches      despite warning signs. Sickling collapse is an intensity syndrome that differs      from other common causes of collapse. Tailored precautions can prevent sickling      collapse and enable athletes with SCT to thrive. Irrationally intense      conditioning for a game puts the lives of healthy athletes with SCT at risk.FAU - Eichner, E RandyAU  - Eichner ERAD  - University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, USA.      reichner1@comcast.netLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Curr Sports Med RepJT  - Current sports medicine reportsJID - 101134380SB  - IMMH  - Anemia, Sickle Cell/*epidemiologyMH  - ComorbidityMH  - FemaleMH  - Football/*injuries/*statistics & numerical dataMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - PrevalenceMH  - Rhabdomyolysis/*epidemiology/*prevention & controlMH  - Risk AssessmentMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - United States/epidemiologyEDAT- 2010/11/12 06:00MHDA- 2011/03/25 06:00CRDT- 2010/11/12 06:00AID - 10.1249/JSR.0b013e3181fc73d7 [doi]AID - 00149619-201011000-00010 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Curr Sports Med Rep. 2010 Nov-Dec;9(6):347-51. doi: 10.1249/JSR.0b013e3181fc73d7.PMID- 21029189OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20101029DCOM- 20110217IS  - 1600-0838 (Electronic)IS  - 0905-7188 (Linking)VI  - 20 Suppl 3DP  - 2010 OctTI  - Dehydration and rehydration in competative sport.PG  - 40-7LID - 10.1111/j.1600-0838.2010.01207.x [doi]AB  - Dehydration, if sufficiently severe, impairs both physical and mental      performance, and performance decrements are greater in hot environments and in      long-lasting exercise. Athletes should begin exercise well hydrated and should      drink during exercise to limit water and salt deficits. Many athletes are      dehydrated to some degree when they begin exercise. During exercise, most drink      less than their sweat losses, some drink too much and a few develop      hyponatraemia. Athletes should learn to assess their hydration needs and develop       a personalized hydration strategy that takes account of exercise, environment and      individual needs. Pre-exercise hydration status can be assessed from urine      frequency and volume, with additional information from urine color, specific      gravity or osmolality. Changes in hydration status during exercise can be      estimated from the change in body mass: sweat rate can be estimated if fluid      intake and urinary losses are also measured. Sweat salt losses can be determined       by collection and analysis of sweat samples. An appropriate, individualized      drinking strategy will take account of pre-exercise hydration status and of      fluid, electrolyte and substrate needs before, during and after a period of      exercise.CI  - (c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.FAU - Maughan, R JAU  - Maughan RJAD  - School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences, Loughborough University,      Loughborough, UK. r.maughan@lboro.ac.ukFAU - Shirreffs, S MAU  - Shirreffs SMLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - DenmarkTA  - Scand J Med Sci SportsJT  - Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sportsJID - 9111504SB  - IMMH  - Competitive Behavior/*physiologyMH  - Dehydration/etiology/*prevention & controlMH  - Exercise/*physiologyMH  - Exercise Tolerance/*physiologyMH  - Fluid Therapy/*methodsMH  - HumansMH  - Oxygen ConsumptionMH  - Sports/*physiologyMH  - Sweat/chemistryMH  - Water-Electrolyte BalanceEDAT- 2010/11/05 06:00MHDA- 2011/02/18 06:00CRDT- 2010/10/30 06:00AID - 10.1111/j.1600-0838.2010.01207.x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Scand J Med Sci Sports. 2010 Oct;20 Suppl 3:40-7. doi:      10.1111/j.1600-0838.2010.01207.x.PMID- 21035586OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20101101DCOM- 20101122IS  - 1555-7162 (Electronic)IS  - 0002-9343 (Linking)VI  - 123IP  - 11DP  - 2010 NovTI  - Sporting events affect spectators' cardiovascular mortality: it is not just a      game.PG  - 972-7LID - 10.1016/j.amjmed.2010.03.026 [doi]AB  - Physiologic and clinical triggers, including mental stress, anxiety, and anger,      often precipitate acute myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death. Sporting       events can acutely increase cardiovascular event and death rates. A greater      impact is observed in patients with known coronary artery disease and when      stressful features are present, including a passionate fan, a high-stakes game, a      high-intensity game, a loss, and a loss played at home. Sporting events affect      cardiovascular health through neuroendocrine responses and possibly an increase      in high-risk behaviors. Acute mental stress increases the activity of the      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis and the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary       system while impairing vagal tone and endothelial function. Collectively, these      mechanisms increase myocardial oxygen demand and decrease myocardial oxygen      supply while also increasing the risk of arrhythmias and thrombosis. Measures can      be taken to reduce cardiovascular risk, including the use of beta-blockers and      aspirin, stress management, transcendental meditation, and avoidance of high-risk      activities, such as smoking, eating fatty foods, overeating, and abusing alcohol       and illicit drugs. Sporting events have the potential to adversely affect      spectators' cardiovascular health, and protective measures should be considered.CI  - Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Data collected from 165 male soccer coaches and 870 male soccer      players including professionals and amateurs. The coaches had a mean age of 40.24      years (SD = 8.40) and had been coaching for an average of 8.56 years (SD = 6.75).      The players had a mean age of 18.40 years (SD = 4.00) and had been playing soccer      for an average of 6.00 years (SD = 4.15) with license. Adapted Turkish version of      Power in Soccer Questionnaire-Other (PSQ-O for soccer players), Power in Soccer      Questionnaire-Self (PSQ-S for coaches) and an information form were used for the       data collection. Cronbach Reliability Alphas of PSQ-O and PSQ-S range between      0.60 and 0.84. Players' and coaches' data were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis and      Mann Whitney Tests. Analysis of PSQ-O revealed significant differences related to      Coersive Power-CP [chi2 (3) = 8.46, p < 0.037], Referent Power-RP [chi2 (3) =      14.84, p < 0.002] and Expert Power-EP [chi2 (3) = 7.63, p < 0.054], and no      significant differences related to Legitimate Power-LP (p > 0.05). Results of      PSQ-O and PSQ-S indicated complex relationships related to belief in good luck or      not. Overall, there are differences between coaches' and players'perception of      CP, LP and EP related to belief in good luck or not. The only similarity appears       to be in perception of RP.

The Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT) is a commonly used paper      neurocognitive tool. To date, little is known about SCAT baseline normative      values in youth athletes. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine      normative values on the SCAT for male and female youth hockey players. METHODS:      This is a secondary data analysis of pooled data from three prospective cohort      studies examining the risk of injury in paediatric ice hockey players aged 9-17      years. A preseason baseline demographic and injury history questionnaire was      completed by each player. RESULTS: A total of 4193 players completed SCATs at      baseline and were included in the analysis. 781 players (18.6%) reported a      previous history of concussion. Fatigue and low energy followed by headache were       the most commonly reported symptoms in all players. The majority of youth players      could recite all five words immediately but only three words when delayed. A      smaller proportion of the males were able to report the months of the year in      reverse order compared with females of a similar age. The median number of digits      recited in reverse order was 4. CONCLUSIONS: Youth ratings varied between age      groups, gender and from previously reported ratings of varsity athletes, possibly      reflecting developmental and gender differences. An understanding of these      differences in youth athletes is important to ensure appropriate performance      expectations on the SCAT and when making clinical decisions following a      concussion.FAU - Schneider, Kathryn JAU  - Schneider KJAD  - Sport Injury Prevention Research Centre, Faculty of Kinesiology, University of      Calgary, 2500 University Drive NW, Calgary, Alberta, Canada. kjschnei@ucalgary.caFAU - Emery, Carolyn AAU  - Emery CAFAU - Kang, JianAU  - Kang JFAU - Schneider, Geoff MAU  - Schneider GMFAU - Meeuwisse, Willem HAU  - Meeuwisse WHLA  - engGR  - Canadian Institutes of Health Research/CanadaPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20101021PL  - EnglandTA  - Br J Sports MedJT  - British journal of sports medicineJID - 0432520SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Brain Concussion/*diagnosisMH  - ChildMH  - FemaleMH  - Hockey/*injuriesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Mental RecallMH  - Prospective StudiesMH  - *Severity of Illness IndexEDAT- 2010/10/23 06:00MHDA- 2011/12/13 00:00CRDT- 2010/10/23 06:00PHST- 2010/10/21 [aheadofprint]AID - bjsm.2009.071266 [pii]AID - 10.1136/bjsm.2009.071266 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Br J Sports Med. 2010 Dec;44(15):1112-7. doi: 10.1136/bjsm.2009.071266.

As this field and its research base are relatively new, clinicians      often deliver psychiatric care to athletes without a full understanding of the      diagnostic and therapeutic issues unique to this population. In this systematic      review, we discuss published findings relating to psychiatric diagnosis and      medical treatment of mental illness in athletes. There have been several studies       looking at the prevalence of some psychiatric disorders in various athlete      populations. Eating disorders and substance abuse are the most studied of these      disorders and appear to be common problems in athletes. However, to provide      informed understanding and treatment, we especially need more research on      overtraining syndrome, bipolar disorder, suicidality, anxiety disorders,      attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and psychosis in athletes.      Research is needed in the areas of prevalence, risk factors, prognosis and the      unique experiences facing athletes with any of these disorders. Additionally,      there have not been any large, systematic studies on the use of psychotropic      medications in athletes. Small studies suggest that some medications may either      be performance enhancing or detrimental to performance, but we need larger      studies with rigorous methodology. Higher level athletes suffering from      psychiatric symptoms often have reservations about taking medications with      unknown performance and safety effects, and methodological issues with the      current literature database preclude any definitive conclusions on performance      effects of psychiatric medications. We need many more, higher quality studies on       the use by athletes of antidepressants, mood stabilizers, anxiolytics, stimulants      and other ADHD medications, sedative-hypnotics and antipsychotics. Such studies      should utilize sensitive performance measures and involve longer term use of      psychotropic medications. Furthermore, study subjects should include athletes who      actually have the psychiatric disorder for which the medication is proposed, and       should include more women.FAU - Reardon, Claudia LAU  - Reardon CLAD  - University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics, Department of Psychiatry, Madison,       Wisconsin 53719, USA. clreardon@wisc.eduFAU - Factor, Robert MAU  - Factor RMLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - New ZealandTA  - Sports MedJT  - Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)JID - 8412297SB  - IMMH  - Athletes/*psychologyMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Mental Disorders/*diagnosis/*drug therapyMH  - PsychiatryEDAT- 2010/10/15 06:00MHDA- 2011/02/17 06:00CRDT- 2010/10/15 06:00AID - 5 [pii]AID - 10.2165/11536580-000000000-00000 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Sports Med. 2010 Nov 1;40(11):961-80. doi: 10.2165/11536580-000000000-00000.PMID- 20942507OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20101014DCOM- 20110216LR  - 20130516IS  - 1179-2035 (Electronic)IS  - 0112-1642 (Linking)VI  - 40IP  - 11DP  - 2010 Nov 1TI  - Behaviour, the key factor for sports injury prevention.PG  - 899-906LID - 10.2165/11536890-000000000-00000 [doi]AB  - Safety in sports and physical activity is an important prerequisite for      continuing participation in sports, as well as for maintenance of a healthy      physically active lifestyle. For this reason, prevention, reduction and control      of sports injuries are important goals for society as a whole. Recent advances in      sports medicine discuss the need for research on real-life injury prevention.      Such views call for a more behavioural approach when it comes to actual sports      injury prevention. Nevertheless, the role of behaviour in sports injury      prevention remains under-researched. In order to push the field of sports injury       prevention forward, this article provides an overview of the relationship between      behaviour and sports injury risk. Different types of behaviour relate to injury      risk factors and injury mechanisms. Behaviour that influences risk factors and      injury mechanisms is not confined only to the athlete. Various types of behaviour      by, for example, the coach, referee, physical therapist or sports associations,      also influence risk factors and injury mechanisms. In addition, multiple      behaviours often act together. Some types of behaviour may directly affect injury      risk and are by definition a risk factor. Other behaviours may only affect risk      factors and injury mechanisms, and influence injury risk indirectly. Recent ideas      on injury prevention that call for studies on real-life injury prevention still      rely heavily on preventive measures that are established through efficacy      research. A serious limitation in such an approach is that one expects that      proven preventive measures will be adopted if the determinants and influences of       sports safety behaviours are understood. Therefore, if one truly wants to prevent      sports injuries in a real-life situation, a broader research focus is needed. In       trying to do so, we need to look at lessons learned from other fields of injury      prevention research.FAU - Verhagen, Evert A L MAU  - Verhagen EAAD  - Department of Public and Occupational Health, EMGO Institute for Health and Care       Research, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.      e.verhagen@vumc.nlFAU - van Stralen, Maartje MAU  - van Stralen MMFAU - van Mechelen, WillemAU  - van Mechelen WLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - New ZealandTA  - Sports MedJT  - Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)JID - 8412297SB  - IMMH  - Athletic Injuries/*prevention & controlMH  - HumansMH  - *Risk Reduction BehaviorEDAT- 2010/10/15 06:00MHDA- 2011/02/17 06:00CRDT- 2010/10/15 06:00AID - 1 [pii]AID - 10.2165/11536890-000000000-00000 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Sports Med. 2010 Nov 1;40(11):899-906. doi: 10.2165/11536890-000000000-00000.PMID- 20935240OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20101011DCOM- 20110121IS  - 1552-4167 (Electronic)IS  - 0145-4455 (Linking)VI  - 34IP  - 5DP  - 2010 SepTI  - How does sport psychology actually improve athletic performance? A framework to      facilitate athletes' and coaches' understanding.PG  - 386-402LID - 10.1177/0145445510383525 [doi]AB  - The popularity of sport psychology, both as an academic discipline and an applied      practice, has grown substantially over the past two decades. Few within the realm      of competitive athletics would argue with the importance of being mentally      prepared prior to an athletic competition as well as the need to maintain that      particular mindset during a competitive contest. Nevertheless, recent research      has shown that many athletes, coaches, and sporting administrators are still      quite reluctant to seek out the services of a qualified sport psychologist, even       if they believe it could help. One of the primary reasons for this hesitation      appears to be a lack of understanding about the process and the mechanisms by      which these mental skills affect performance. Unlike the "harder sciences" of      sport physiology and biochemistry where athletes can see the tangible results in       themselves or other athletes (e.g., he or she lifted weights, developed larger      muscles, and is now stronger/faster as a result), the unfamiliar and often      esoteric nature of sport psychology appears to be impeding a large number of      athletes from soliciting these important services. As such, the purpose of this      article is to provide the reader with a simple framework depicting how mental      skills training translates into improved within-competition performance. This      framework is intended to help bridge the general "understanding gap" that is      currently being reported by a large number of athletes and coaches, while also      helping sport psychology practitioners sell their valuable services to individual      athletes and teams.FAU - Gee, Chris JAU  - Gee CJAD  - Department of Exercise Sciences, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada       M5S 2W6. chris.gee@utoronto.caLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Behav ModifJT  - Behavior modificationJID - 7803043SB  - IMMH  - Athletes/*psychologyMH  - Athletic Performance/*psychologyMH  - GoalsMH  - HumansMH  - Sports/*psychologyEDAT- 2010/10/12 06:00MHDA- 2011/01/22 06:00CRDT- 2010/10/12 06:00AID - 34/5/386 [pii]AID - 10.1177/0145445510383525 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Behav Modif. 2010 Sep;34(5):386-402. doi: 10.1177/0145445510383525.PMID- 20870449OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20110308DCOM- 20110609IS  - 1476-5411 (Electronic)IS  - 1367-0484 (Linking)VI  - 34IP  - 2DP  - 2011 AprTI  - Attitudes towards visual correction in sport: What coaches, physical education      teachers and sports physicians think.PG  - 71-6LID - 10.1016/j.clae.2010.08.006 [doi]AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate sport professionals' attitudes towards visual correction in       sport. METHOD: A questionnaire was handed out in schools, gyms, sports centres      and universities, to coaches, physical education teachers and final year students      of motor science. The questionnaire was given to one group of sport physicians      prior to a 1-day scientific update course on the benefits of contact lenses (CLs)      in sport. At the end of the course, certain questions from the questionnaire were      given out again in order to evaluate the effect of the update on their opinions.       RESULTS: A total of 245 questionnaires were collected. The interviewees stated      that correcting a vision defect during sports practice was important, but their      propensity to suggest CLs for sport, though still rather high in value, showed a       statistically significant drop. This drop did not occur if the CLs were      recommended for competitive sports. This trend remained unchanged if a specific      judgement was requested for the adolescent category. The tendency to suggest CLs       was higher in CL wearers as compared to non-wearers. The sport with the lowest      recommendation of CLs was swimming. In the sample of sports physicians, a      specific education on the subject of CLs increased the propensity to adopt CLs in      sports. CONCLUSIONS: The main "actors" in the sports sector regard correcting a      vision defect during sport to be important. Nevertheless, their tendency to      suggest CLs is significantly lower. Works that make these categories aware of the      benefits of CLs in sport can certainly help to fill this gap.CI  - Copyright (c) 2010 British Contact Lens Association.

Disordered eating occurs on a continuum from dieting and restrictive eating,      abnormal eating behavior, and finally clinical eating disorders. The prevalence      of eating disorders is increased in elite athletes and for this group the cause      of starting to diet is related to (a) perception of the paradigm of appearance in      the specific sport, (b) perceived performance improvements, and (c) sociocultural      pressures for thinness or an "ideal" body. Athletes most at risk for disordered      eating are those involved in sports emphasizing a thin body size/shape, a high      power-to-weight ratio, and/or sports utilizing weight categories, such as in some      high-intensity sports. In addition to dieting, personality factors, pressure to      lose weight, frequent weight cycling, early start of sport-specific training,      overtraining, injuries, and unfortunate coaching behavior, are important risk      factors. To prevent disordered eating and eating disorders, the athletes have to       practice healthy eating, and the medical staff of teams and parents must be able       to recognize symptoms indicating risk for eating disorders. Coaches and leaders      must accept that disordered eating can be a problem in the athletic community and      that openness regarding this challenge is important.CI  - (c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.FAU - Sundgot-Borgen, JAU  - Sundgot-Borgen JAD  - The Norwegian School of Sport Sciences, the Sports Medicine Department, Oslo,      Norway. jorunn.sundgotborgen@nih.noFAU - Torstveit, M KAU  - Torstveit MKLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - DenmarkTA  - Scand J Med Sci SportsJT  - Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sportsJID - 9111504SB  - IMMH  - Anorexia Nervosa/*epidemiology/prevention & control/psychologyMH  - Bulimia Nervosa/*epidemiology/prevention & control/psychologyMH  - FemaleMH  - Female Athlete Triad Syndrome/*epidemiology/prevention & control/psychologyMH  - HumansMH  - Isometric Contraction/*physiologyMH  - MaleMH  - PrevalenceMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Sex FactorsMH  - Sports/*physiology/psychologyMH  - United States/epidemiologyEDAT- 2010/09/25 06:00MHDA- 2011/04/13 06:00CRDT- 2010/09/16 06:00AID - 10.1111/j.1600-0838.2010.01190.x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Scand J Med Sci Sports. 2010 Oct;20 Suppl 2:112-21. doi:      10.1111/j.1600-0838.2010.01190.x.PMID- 20840567OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20100915DCOM- 20110412IS  - 1600-0838 (Electronic)IS  - 0905-7188 (Linking)VI  - 20 Suppl 2DP  - 2010 OctTI  - Preventing overtraining in athletes in high-intensity sports and stress/recovery       monitoring.PG  - 95-102LID - 10.1111/j.1600-0838.2010.01192.x [doi]AB  - In sports, the importance of optimizing the recovery-stress state is critical.      Effective recovery from intense training loads often faced by elite athletes can       often determine sporting success or failure. In recent decades, athletes,      coaches, and sport scientists have been keen to find creative, new methods for      improving the quality and quantity of training for athletes. These efforts have      consistently faced barriers, including overtraining, fatigue, injury, illness,      and burnout. Physiological and psychological limits dictate a need for research      that addresses the avoidance of overtraining, maximizes recovery, and      successfully negotiates the fine line between high and excessive training loads.       Monitoring instruments like the Recovery-Stress Questionnaire for Athletes can      assist with this research by providing a tool to assess their perceived state of       recovery.

This paper is a comprehensive review      of PST in elite sports, with a special focus on high-intensity sports (HIS). The       reviewed literature showed a lack of convincing evidence and theoretical      underpinning concerning traditional psychological skills to enhance performance      in HIS. Therefore, a model with three conceptual levels (psychological demands,      skills and techniques) is presented. The model facilitates the identification of       the psychological demands of a specific sport, which in turn enables      distinguishing which psychological skills are required. This allows an expert to       choose psychological techniques to improve the athlete's psychological skill.      Considerations based on our model and the limited HIS-related literature      available revealed self-skills, personal development and life skills,      arousal-regulation skills, volitional skills, motivational skills and recovery      skills as the most important skills to address in order to enhance performance.      Development of harmonious passion, in-practice integration of volitional      strategies, use of associative attentional techniques, pain management      techniques, use of the mindfulness-acceptance approach and the facilitative      interpretation of cognitive and somatic sensations are regarded as suitable to      meet the psychological demands of HIS. They are recommended for systematic      application by athletes and coaches.CI  - (c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.FAU - Birrer, DAU  - Birrer DAD  - Swiss Federal Institute of Sport Magglingen, Magglingen, Switzerland.      daniel.birrer@baspo.admin.chFAU - Morgan, GAU  - Morgan GLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - DenmarkTA  - Scand J Med Sci SportsJT  - Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sportsJID - 9111504SB  - IMMH  - *Adaptation, PsychologicalMH  - AttentionMH  - Bicycling/physiology/*psychologyMH  - Fatigue/psychologyMH  - HumansMH  - Isometric Contraction/*physiologyMH  - Pain/psychologyMH  - Pain MeasurementMH  - Running/physiology/*psychologyMH  - Stress, PsychologicalMH  - Swimming/physiology/*psychologyMH  - Task Performance and AnalysisEDAT- 2010/09/25 06:00MHDA- 2011/04/13 06:00CRDT- 2010/09/16 06:00AID - 10.1111/j.1600-0838.2010.01188.x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Scand J Med Sci Sports. 2010 Oct;20 Suppl 2:78-87. doi:      10.1111/j.1600-0838.2010.01188.x.PMID- 20840560OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20100915DCOM- 20110412IS  - 1600-0838 (Electronic)IS  - 0905-7188 (Linking)VI  - 20 Suppl 2DP  - 2010 OctTI  - Effects of strength training on muscle fiber types and size; consequences for      athletes training for high-intensity sport.PG  - 32-8LID - 10.1111/j.1600-0838.2010.01196.x [doi]AB  - Training toward improving performance in sports involving high intense exercise      can and is done in many different ways based on a mixture of tradition in the      specific sport, coaches' experience and scientific recommendations. Strength      training is a form of training that now-a-days have found its way into almost all      sports in which high intense work is conducted. In this review we will focus on a      few selected aspects and consequences of strength training; namely what effects      do strength training have of muscle fiber type composition, and how may these      effects change the contractile properties of the muscle and finally how will this      affect the performance of the athlete. In addition, the review will deal with      muscle hypertrophy and how it develops with strength training. Overall, it is not      the purpose of this review to give a comprehensive up-date of the area, but to      pin-point a few issues from which functional training advises can be made. Thus,       more than a review in the traditional context this review should be viewed upon      as an attempt to bring sports-physiologists and coaches or others working      directly with the athletes together for a mutual discussion on how recently      acquired physiological knowledge are put into practise.CI  - (c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.FAU - Andersen, J LAU  - Andersen JLAD  - Institute of Sports Medicine Copenhagen, Bispebjerg Hospital, University of      Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark. jand0085@bbh.regionh.dkFAU - Aagaard, PAU  - Aagaard PLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - DenmarkTA  - Scand J Med Sci SportsJT  - Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sportsJID - 9111504SB  - IMMH  - Exercise Tolerance/*physiologyMH  - HumansMH  - Isometric Contraction/*physiologyMH  - Muscle Fibers, Fast-Twitch/metabolism/*physiologyMH  - Muscle Strength/*physiologyMH  - Muscle, Skeletal/metabolism/*physiologyMH  - Resistance TrainingEDAT- 2010/09/25 06:00MHDA- 2011/04/13 06:00CRDT- 2010/09/16 06:00AID - 10.1111/j.1600-0838.2010.01196.x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Scand J Med Sci Sports. 2010 Oct;20 Suppl 2:32-8. doi:      10.1111/j.1600-0838.2010.01196.x.PMID- 20795336OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20100827DCOM- 20100924IS  - 0885-1158 (Print)IS  - 0885-1158 (Linking)VI  - 25IP  - 2DP  - 2010 JunTI  - Comparative analysis of substance use in ballet, dance sport, and synchronized      swimming: results of a longitudinal study.PG  - 75-81AB  - There have been few studies comparing substance use and misuse (SU&M) in      different performing arts forms. Herein, we identified and compared SU&M in women      studying an art (ballet, n = 21), a non-Olympic sport (dance sport, n = 25), and       an Olympic sport (synchronized swimming, n = 23). The sample of variables      comprised general, educational, and sport factors, as well as SU&M data,      including consumption of opiates, cigarettes, alcohol, nutritional supplements,      doping behaviors, and beliefs. Using the Kruskal-Wallis test, we found no      significant differences between study groups in potential doping behaviors. Most       of the examinees reported that they did not rely on physicians' and/or coaches'      opinions regarding doping. Only sport dancers recognized their consumption of      cannabis as a violation of anti-doping rules. Those more convinced that doping      habits are present in their sport (or art) have a certain tendency toward doping       usage.

The International Paralympic Committee considers AD      doping and banned its use. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate AD      knowledge, incidence and attitudes (KIA) of Paralympians with SCI. METHODS: An      existing questionnaire was modified to include questions of AD KIA, validated by       three experts and piloted with a small sample. It was administered on-line,      mailed to members of a scientific network and distributed during the Beijing      Paralympic Games. Fisher Exact test was used to evaluate differences across      gender, injury and education. RESULTS: Of 99 participants, 54.5% had previously      heard of AD while 39.4% were unaware; 16.7%, all males, had used AD to enhance      performance. Participants reported that AD was (1) useful for middle (78.6%) and       long distance (71.4%), marathon (64.3%) and wheelchair rugby (64.3%); (2)      somewhat dangerous (48.9%), dangerous (21.3%) or very dangerous (25.5%) to      health. Results were not influenced by age, injury level or injury duration.      CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate the need for educational programmes directed      towards enhancing the AD knowledge of rehabilitation professionals, coaches and      trainers working with SCI individuals.FAU - Bhambhani, YageshAU  - Bhambhani YAD  - Faculty of Rehabilitation Medicine, University of Alberta, Canada.      yagesh.bhambhani@ualberta.caFAU - Mactavish, JenniferAU  - Mactavish JFAU - Warren, SharonAU  - Warren SFAU - Thompson, Walter RAU  - Thompson WRFAU - Webborn, AnthonyAU  - Webborn AFAU - Bressan, ElizabethAU  - Bressan EFAU - De Mello, Marco TuiloAU  - De Mello MTFAU - Tweedy, SeanAU  - Tweedy SFAU - Malone, LaurieAU  - Malone LFAU - Frojd, KennetAU  - Frojd KFAU - Van De Vliet, PeterAU  - Van De Vliet PFAU - Vanlandewijck, YvesAU  - Vanlandewijck YLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - EnglandTA  - Disabil RehabilJT  - Disability and rehabilitationJID - 9207179SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - *Athletic PerformanceMH  - Autonomic Dysreflexia/*physiopathologyMH  - FemaleMH  - *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, PracticeMH  - Heart Rate/physiologyMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Paraplegia/*physiopathology/rehabilitationMH  - Pilot ProjectsMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Spinal Cord Injuries/*physiopathology/rehabilitationMH  - *SportsMH  - *WheelchairsEDAT- 2010/08/20 06:00MHDA- 2011/05/03 06:00CRDT- 2010/08/20 06:00AID - 10.3109/09638288.2010.505678 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Disabil Rehabil. 2010;32(26):2172-90. doi: 10.3109/09638288.2010.505678.PMID- 20714453OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20100817DCOM- 20100928IS  - 1533-7294 (Electronic)IS  - 0094-3509 (Linking)VI  - 59IP  - 8DP  - 2010 AugTI  - Give your sports physicals a performance boost.PG  - 437-44AB  - Cover the 12 components of the preparticipation physical evaluation (PPE)      recommended by the American Heart Association to screen young athletes for      potentially life-threatening cardiovascular disease.

Qualitative interviews with eight elite coaches from the Western       Australian Institute of Sport (WAIS) in Perth, Australia revealed that coaches      facilitated athletes' return to sport from injury through a variety of means, but      did not typically provide systematic forms of assistance. Coaches commented that       the idiosyncratic nature of the injury experience meant that they needed to apply      strategies consistent with athletes' particular psychosocial needs. Such      strategies included: (a) coordination of a "team approach" to rehabilitation; (b)      fostering open communication with athletes and treatment team members; (c) social      support; (d) positive thinking and goal setting; and (e) role models. Analysis of      these strategies revealed that coaches attempted to address competence, autonomy,      and relatedness needs in facilitating athletes' return from injury. These      findings suggest that self-determination theory may be a valuable approach for      examining coach forms of assistance regarding athletes' return to competition      following injury. Findings are discussed in relation to injury literature and      self-determination theory.

METHODS: A      random sample of university coaches (N=203) was investigated (136 male and 67      female coaches; 131 coaches, with 10 yr or more work experience, and 72 coaches      with less than 10 yr job experience). Two questionnaires-the Coach Burnout      Questionnaire (CBQ) and Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10)-were used. The      statistical hypotheses were tested by the independent samples t-test and binary      logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences at      the 0.01 level for burnout among coaches with 10 yr or more (burnout average      score and standard deviation 2.28 +/- 0.42), and coaches, who less than 10 yr job      experience (1.97 +/- 0.35) were found. No differences were observed between males      and females with regard to burnout. The odds ratio (OR) of perceived stress for      burnout was 1.92; 95% CI 1.01-3.64. CONCLUSIONS: Significant association between       burnout and job experience of 10 yr or more as compared to less than 10 yr among       the university coaches was observed. High levels of perceived stress among      university coaches are significantly related to burnout.FAU - Malinauskas, RomualdasAU  - Malinauskas RAD  - Lithuanian Academy of Physical Education. r.malinauskas@lkka.itFAU - Malinauskiene, VilijaAU  - Malinauskiene VFAU - Dumciene, AudroneAU  - Dumciene ALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20100806PL  - JapanTA  - J Occup HealthJT  - Journal of occupational healthJID - 9616320SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Burnout, Professional/*psychologyMH  - Employment/*statistics & numerical dataMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - LithuaniaMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Sex FactorsMH  - *SportsMH  - *Stress, PsychologicalMH  - Time FactorsMH  - UniversitiesEDAT- 2010/08/11 06:00MHDA- 2011/01/13 06:00CRDT- 2010/08/11 06:00PHST- 2010/08/06 [aheadofprint]AID - JST.JSTAGE/joh/O10006 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - J Occup Health. 2010;52(5):302-7.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to      determine the need for education of coaches in the prevention, assessment and      management of sports-related injuries in South Dakota (SD). METHODS: Survey link       e-mailed to 1,050 HS athletic head coaches in SD; 247 (23.5 percent) completed      the prospective, web-based survey. RESULTS: Of the respondents, 74.91 percent      reported HS enrollments less than 300, with 79.36 percent in rural/frontier      counties and 28.74 percent in medically underserved areas. Coaches from 14 sports      responded. The majority indicated they were responsible for the immediate medical      care of athletes at practices (89.07 percent) and competitions (74.90 percent);      and 79.76 percent of coaches agreed or strongly agreed they needed more injury      management education. Results also indicated less than 50.00 percent had current       certifications in CPR/BLS (46.65 percent) and first aid (47.4 percent).      CONCLUSIONS: Due to the demand placed on head coaches to be the initial      caregivers for injured athletes, there is a need for increased education of SD      coaches related to the management of acute sports injuries. Additionally, policy       changes may be indicated to address the lack of medical personnel available      during HS athletic competitions and practices.FAU - Cross, Patrick SAU  - Cross PSAD  - University of South Dakota School of Health Sciences, Department of Physical      Therapy, Vermillion, SD, USA.FAU - Karges, Joy RAU  - Karges JRFAU - Adamson, Amanda JAU  - Adamson AJFAU - Arnold, Michael RAU  - Arnold MRFAU - Meier, Casey MAU  - Meier CMFAU - Hood, Justin EAU  - Hood JELA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - S D MedJT  - South Dakota medicine : the journal of the South Dakota State Medical AssociationJID - 101265265SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Athletic Injuries/*therapyMH  - Data CollectionMH  - FacultyMH  - FemaleMH  - *First AidMH  - *Health EducationMH  - *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, PracticeMH  - HumansMH  - InternetMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - *Needs AssessmentMH  - Prospective StudiesMH  - SchoolsMH  - South DakotaMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2010/07/30 06:00MHDA- 2010/10/12 06:00CRDT- 2010/07/30 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - S D Med. 2010 Jul;63(7):241-5.PMID- 20661467OWN - NLMSTAT- PublisherDA  - 20110927IS  - 0741-1235 (Print)IS  - 0741-1235 (Linking)VI  - 26IP  - 2DP  - 2009 Jun 1TI  - Mental Well-Being and Sport-Related Identities in College Students.PG  - 335-356AB  - Past research has linked physical activity and sports participation with improved      mental and social well-being, including reduced risk of depression and      suicidality. In this study we examined relationships among several dimensions of       athletic involvement (team sport participation, individual sport participation,      athlete identity, and jock identity), gender, and depression and suicidal      behavior in a sample of 791 undergraduate students. Both participation in a team       sport and athlete identity were associated with lower depression scores. Athlete       identity was also associated with lower odds of a past-year suicide attempt,      whereas jock identity was associated with elevated odds of a suicide attempt. The      findings are discussed in light of the relationship between mental well-being and      a larger constellation of health-risk behaviors linked to a "toxic jock"      identity.FAU - Miller, Kathleen EAU  - Miller KEAD  - the University at Buffalo, Research Institute on Addictions, 1021 Main Street,      Buffalo, NY, 14203.FAU - Hoffman, Joseph HAU  - Hoffman JHLA  - ENGGR  - R21 DA016581/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R21 DA016581-03/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLETA  - Sociol Sport JJT  - Sociology of sport journalJID - 9882612PMC - PMC2908331MID - NIHMS212596EDAT- 2010/07/28 06:00MHDA- 2010/07/28 06:00CRDT- 2010/07/28 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Sociol Sport J. 2009 Jun 1;26(2):335-356.PMID- 20645447OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20100720DCOM- 20100727IS  - 0030-6002 (Print)IS  - 0030-6002 (Linking)VI  - 151IP  - 28DP  - 2010 Jul 11TI  - [In love with sports.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred children      and youngsters 8- to 15-year-old (147 boys and 53 girls) attending Sports      Societies in Isernia, a town in Southern Italy, participated to the      investigation. The sports involved were soccer, martial arts, tennis, swimming,      volleyball, basketball and cycling. The questionnaire was structured into three      parts: 1) questions about age, sex, type and time of sports practice; 2)      questions about dental injuries, particularly personal experience, awareness of      first aid and procedure about tooth avulsion; 3) questions about knowledge and      use of mouthguards. RESULTS: Sixty-five per cent of the athletes were aware of      the possibility of oral injuries during sports practice and 8.5% referred an      experience of dental trauma; 71.5% of the participants think that the immediate      management of dental injuries by a dentist is very important to increase the rate      of success; 31% know that the avulsed tooth may be reimplanted: 33.9% would      reimplant the tooth within an hour and 62.9% would keep it in a wet storage      medium. Finally, 80.5% of the athletes knew about mouthguards as protective      devices, but only 5% actually used them; eight out of ten were provided by the      dentist. CONCLUSION: Educational programs organized by the sports dentistry      community are needed to inform coaches, teachers, athletes and parents about      dental injuries and to promote the mouthguards use, especially in contact sports       practice.FAU - Biagi, RAU  - Biagi RAD  - Department of Paediatric Dentistry, School of Dentistry, University of Milan,      Milan, Italy. roberto.biagi@unimi.itFAU - Cardarelli, FAU  - Cardarelli FFAU - Butti, A CAU  - Butti ACFAU - Salvato, AAU  - Salvato ALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - ItalyTA  - Eur J Paediatr DentJT  - European journal of paediatric dentistry : official journal of European Academy      of Paediatric DentistryJID - 101121881SB  - DSB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Athletic Injuries/*psychologyMH  - ChildMH  - FemaleMH  - First Aid/*psychologyMH  - *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, PracticeMH  - HumansMH  - ItalyMH  - MaleMH  - Mouth Protectors/*utilizationMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Tooth Avulsion/therapyMH  - Tooth Injuries/*psychologyEDAT- 2010/07/20 06:00MHDA- 2010/08/17 06:00CRDT- 2010/07/20 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Eur J Paediatr Dent. 2010 Jun;11(2):66-70.PMID- 20631461OWN - NLMSTAT- In-Data-ReviewDA  - 20100715IS  - 0091-3847 (Print)IS  - 0091-3847 (Linking)VI  - 38IP  - 2DP  - 2010 JunTI  - Sports injuries in young athletes: long-term outcome and prevention strategies.PG  - 29-34LID - 10.3810/psm.2010.06.1780 [doi]AB  - Physical activity plays a significant role in the physical and emotional      well-being of a child. In the past 15 to 20 years, there has been a dramatic      increase in sports participation at a young age, which has offered numerous      health benefits, including self-esteem, confidence, team play, fitness, agility,       and strength. Children are playing sports at younger ages. This article assesses       the long-term outcome of sports injuries in young athletes, with suggestions on      how to prevent such injuries. There are no definitive epidemiological data on      withdraw from sports activities due to injury in young athletes. Disturbed      physeal growth as a result of injury can result in length discrepancy, angular      deformity, or altered joint mechanics, and may cause significant long-term      disability. Sequelae of Osgood-Schlatter lesion include painful ossicle in the      distal patellar tendon. Fragmentation or separation of the apophysis appears to      be the result of adaptive changes to the increased stress that occurs in overuse       activities. The presence of these changes undeniably demonstrates an osseous      reaction, although they are not disabling. Promotion of a physically active      lifestyle is encouraged worldwide, particularly with regard to the many health      benefits. Reduction of only a moderate proportion of all sports injuries is of      significance for the young athletes' health and could have a long-term economic      impact on health care costs. It is therefore important to convince medical      doctors, physical therapists, athletic trainers and coaches, as well as athletes       of the necessity to implement active prevention measures in their therapy and      training programs, thus decreasing the injury and re-injury rate and enhancing      athletic performance.FAU - Maffulli, NicolaAU  - Maffulli NAD  - , , , , .FAU - Longo, Umile GiuseppeAU  - Longo UGFAU - Spiezia, FilippoAU  - Spiezia FFAU - Denaro, VincenzoAU  - Denaro VLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Phys SportsmedJT  - The Physician and sportsmedicineJID - 0427461SB  - IMEDAT- 2010/07/16 06:00MHDA- 2010/07/16 06:00CRDT- 2010/07/16 06:00AID - 10.3810/psm.2010.06.1780 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Phys Sportsmed. 2010 Jun;38(2):29-34. doi: 10.3810/psm.2010.06.1780.PMID- 20601743OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20100705DCOM- 20100923IS  - 1526-484X (Print)IS  - 1526-484X (Linking)VI  - 20IP  - 3DP  - 2010 JunTI  - Evaluation of Iranian college athletes' sport nutrition knowledge.PG  - 257-63AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the nutrition knowledge and the factors      determining this knowledge in Iranian college basketball and football athletes.      By highlighting gaps in nutrition knowledge of these athletes, sport nutrition      professionals may begin to address these gaps by educating athletes with a view      toward minimizing injury and enhancing sport performance. Sixty-six basketball      and 141 football players (response rate 78.4%) from 4 medical and 8 nonmedical      universities in Tehran agreed to participate in this cross-sectional study. A      2-part questionnaire was used; the first part comprised questions identifying      demographic information, and the second part comprised a previously      well-validated questionnaire on sport nutrition knowledge. The overall knowledge       score was 33.2% (+/- 12.3%). Men scored 28.2% (+/- 12.7%), and women, 38.7% (+/-       14.2%). In both genders, the highest score was obtained for the nutrients      subcategory, and the supplements subcategory was the most poorly answered. When      compared with their peers, a significantly higher score was obtained by women (p       < .001), athletes at medical universities (p < .001), and those obtaining      nutrition information from reputable sources (p = .03). The coach was cited by      89.4% of athletes as their main source of nutrition information. This study      showed that the sport nutrition knowledge of these athletes is inadequate.      Considering that this substandard level of knowledge may contribute to poor      dietary behaviors, these athletes would benefit from nutrition-related training      and education.FAU - Jessri, MahsaAU  - Jessri MAD  - Obesity Research Center, Research Institute for Endocrine Sciences, Shahid      Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.FAU - Jessri, MaryamAU  - Jessri MFAU - RashidKhani, BahramAU  - RashidKhani BFAU - Zinn, CarynAU  - Zinn CLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Int J Sport Nutr Exerc MetabJT  - International journal of sport nutrition and exercise metabolismJID - 100939812SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Athletes/*psychologyMH  - BasketballMH  - Cross-Sectional StudiesMH  - FemaleMH  - FootballMH  - Health Education/*organization & administrationMH  - *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, PracticeMH  - HumansMH  - IranMH  - MaleMH  - Nutritional Physiological PhenomenaMH  - Nutritional RequirementsMH  - Nutritional Sciences/*educationMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Sports MedicineMH  - Students/psychologyMH  - UniversitiesMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2010/07/06 06:00MHDA- 2010/09/24 06:00CRDT- 2010/07/06 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Int J Sport Nutr Exerc Metab. 2010 Jun;20(3):257-63.PMID- 20582557OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20110106DCOM- 20110525LR  - 20140824IS  - 1432-0932 (Electronic)IS  - 0940-6719 (Linking)VI  - 20IP  - 1DP  - 2011 JanTI  - Low back pain in childhood and adolescence: assessment of sports activities.PG  - 94-9LID - 10.1007/s00586-010-1485-8 [doi]AB  - A cross-sectional study that targeted a total of 43,630 pupils in Niigata City,      Japan was performed. The objective of the study was to evaluate the association      between sports activities and low back pain (LBP) in childhood and adolescence in      Japan. Regarding risk factors of LBP, a large number of studies have been      conducted that have examined gender differences, height and weight, body mass      index, sports time, differences in lifestyle, family history, and mental factors;      however, no definitive conclusion has yet been made. A questionnaire survey was      conducted using 43,630 pupils, including all elementary school pupils from the      fourth to sixth grade (21,893 pupils) and all junior high pupils from the first      to third year (21,737 pupils) in Niigata City (population of 785,067). 26,766      pupils who were determined to have valid responses (valid response rate 61.3%)      were analyzed. Among the 26,766 pupils with valid responses, 2,591 (9.7%) had LBP      at the time of the survey, and 8,588 (32.1%) had a history of LBP. The pupils      were divided between those who did not participate in sports activities except      the physical education in school (No sports group: 5,486, 20.5%) and those who      participated in sports activities (Sports group: 21,280, 79.5%), and the      difference in lifetime prevalence between No sports group and Sports group was      examined. The odds ratio for LBP according to sports activity was calculated by      multiple logistic regression analysis adjusted for gender, age, and body mass      index. In addition, the severity of LBP was divided into three levels (Level 1:      no limitation in any activity, Level 2: necessary to refrain from participating      in sports and physical activities, and Level 3: necessary to be absent from      school), and Levels 2 and 3 were defined as severe LBP; the severity was compared      between No sports group and Sports group and in each sport's items. Moreover, in       Sports group, the amount of time spent participating in sports activities were      divided into three groups (Group 1: less than 6 h per week, Group 2: 6-12 h per      week, and Group 3: 12.1 h per week or more), and the dose-response between the      amount of time spent participating in sports activities and the occurrence of LBP      were compared. In No sports group, 21.3% experienced a history of LBP; in Sports       group, 34.9% experienced LBP (P < 0.001). In comparison to No sports group, the      odds ratio was significantly higher for Sports group (1.57), and also      significantly higher for most of the sports items. The severity of LBP was      significantly higher in Sports group (20.1 vs. 3.2%, P < 0.001). The amount of      time spent participating in sports activities averaged 9.8 h per week, and a      history of LBP significantly increased in the group which spent a longer time      participating in sports activities (odds ratio 1.43 in Group 3). These findings      suggest that sports activity is possible risk factors for the occurrence of LBP,       and it might increase the risk for LBP in childhood and adolescence.FAU - Sato, TsuyoshiAU  - Sato TAD  - Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Niigata Prefectural Shibata Hospital, 1-2-8      Honchou, Shibata, Japan. tsuyoshis1@mac.comFAU - Ito, TakuiAU  - Ito TFAU - Hirano, ToruAU  - Hirano TFAU - Morita, OsamuAU  - Morita OFAU - Kikuchi, RenAU  - Kikuchi RFAU - Endo, NaotoAU  - Endo NFAU - Tanabe, NaohitoAU  - Tanabe NLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20100626PL  - GermanyTA  - Eur Spine JJT  - European spine journal : official publication of the European Spine Society, the       European Spinal Deformity Society, and the European Section of the Cervical Spine      Research SocietyJID - 9301980SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - ChildMH  - Cross-Sectional StudiesMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - Japan/epidemiologyMH  - *Life StyleMH  - Logistic ModelsMH  - Low Back Pain/*diagnosis/*epidemiologyMH  - MaleMH  - *Motor ActivityMH  - PrevalenceMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Sports/*statistics & numerical dataPMC - PMC3036027OID - NLM: PMC3036027EDAT- 2010/06/29 06:00MHDA- 2011/05/26 06:00CRDT- 2010/06/29 06:00PHST- 2009/04/03 [received]PHST- 2010/06/11 [accepted]PHST- 2010/04/14 [revised]PHST- 2010/06/26 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1007/s00586-010-1485-8 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Eur Spine J. 2011 Jan;20(1):94-9. doi: 10.1007/s00586-010-1485-8.

METHODS: A review of      key and relevant literature is presented, followed by a discussion of the sport      science support provision and the issues that emerged in working with athletes      with learning difficulties. Pre- and post- physiological tests along with      evaluations of athletes' potential to benefit from sport psychology support were       conducted. The aim of these tests was to provide information for the athletes and      the coaches on fitness levels, to use this information to plan future training,      and to identify how well the performance could be enhanced. RESULTS: A case study      is presented for one athlete, who had competed in distance events. The focus is      the psychological support that was provided. CONCLUSIONS: It is clear that      athletes with learning difficulties require the same type of sports science      support as their mainstream peers. However, sport scientists will need to      consider ways to extend their practice in order to provide the appropriate level       of support.FAU - Hills, LauraAU  - Hills LAD  - School of Sport and Education, Heinz Wolff Building, University of Brunel,      Uxbridge, Middlesex UB8 3PH, UK. laura.hills@brunel.ac.ukFAU - Utley, AndreaAU  - Utley ALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - EnglandTA  - Disabil RehabilJT  - Disability and rehabilitationJID - 9207179SB  - IMMH  - CounselingMH  - HumansMH  - Learning Disorders/*therapyMH  - *Psychology, AppliedMH  - Sports/*psychologyEDAT- 2010/06/26 06:00MHDA- 2010/12/25 06:00CRDT- 2010/06/26 06:00AID - 10.3109/09638288.2010.496940 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Disabil Rehabil. 2010;32(18):1488-94. doi: 10.3109/09638288.2010.496940.PMID- 20544490OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20100614DCOM- 20101202IS  - 1466-447X (Electronic)IS  - 0264-0414 (Linking)VI  - 28IP  - 8DP  - 2010 JunTI  - Differences in self-regulatory skills among talented athletes: the significance      of competitive level and type of sport.PG  - 901-8LID - 10.1080/02640411003797157 [doi]AB  - Research has shown that talented athletes outscore their mainstream peers on the       basis of self-regulation. Although valuable, this does not tell us more about the      distinction between good athletes and the best, which is a prerequisite in talent      development. Therefore, we examined the self-regulatory skills of 222 male and      female talented athletes aged 12-16 years as a function of competitive sport      level (junior international or junior national athletes) and type of sport      (individual or team sports). Multivariate analyses of covariance in combination      with a discriminant function analysis revealed that "reflection" distinguishes      between athletes at the highest levels of excellence. Furthermore, athletes      playing individual sports had higher scores on "planning" and "effort" than team       sport athletes, highlighting the importance of differences between types of      sport. In conclusion, we emphasize the importance of reflection as a      self-regulatory skill. Reflection facilitates the development of sport-specific      characteristics, which may vary by type of sport. This means that an advanced      sense of reflection may help talented athletes to acquire desirable      characteristics during their "talent" years to ultimately reach adult elite      levels of competition.FAU - Jonker, LauraAU  - Jonker LAD  - Center for Human Movement Sciences, University Medical Center Groningen,      University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands. l.jonker@med.umcg.nlFAU - Elferink-Gemser, Marije TAU  - Elferink-Gemser MTFAU - Visscher, ChrisAU  - Visscher CLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - EnglandTA  - J Sports SciJT  - Journal of sports sciencesJID - 8405364SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - *AptitudeMH  - Athletes/*psychologyMH  - ChildMH  - *Competitive BehaviorMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - *Mental ProcessesMH  - Multivariate AnalysisMH  - *Social Control, InformalMH  - Sports/*psychologyEDAT- 2010/06/15 06:00MHDA- 2010/12/14 06:00CRDT- 2010/06/15 06:00AID - 922927272 [pii]AID - 10.1080/02640411003797157 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Sci. 2010 Jun;28(8):901-8. doi: 10.1080/02640411003797157.PMID- 20542975OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20101125DCOM- 20111123IS  - 1473-0480 (Electronic)IS  - 0306-3674 (Linking)VI  - 44IP  - 15DP  - 2010 DecTI  - Coaches' perspectives on implementing an evidence-informed injury prevention      programme in junior community netball.PG  - 1128-32LID - 10.1136/bjsm.2009.069039 [doi]AB  - OBJECTIVE: For effective sports injury prevention, information is needed about      the implementation context for interventions. This study describes coaches'      feedback on the implementation of an evidence-informed injury prevention      programme in community junior netball using coaches' perceptions and the RE-AIM      framework. METHODS: A lower-limb injury prevention programme (Down to Earth;      D2E), for teaching safe-landing techniques, was delivered to 31 coaches from 31      junior community netball teams in a 1-h workshop. Coaches then delivered a 6-week      programme at team training sessions starting in the week before the competition      season commenced. 65% of coaches completed a feedback survey 17 weeks after they       had delivered the programme. RESULTS: Most (88%) coaches believed that D2E      improved their players' ability to perform correct landing techniques in games      and that players had retained these improvements over the season. The majority      (83%) indicated that an improvement in player athletic attributes was the      greatest advantage of D2E, followed by a reduction in injury risk. Identified      barriers to implementing D2E were running out of time and very young players      finding the drills too difficult. Coaches reported that they needed more ideas      for training drills that could be incorporated into their programmes and believed      that their own coaching training did not adequately prepare them to implement an       injury prevention programme. CONCLUSIONS: Although coaches believed that D2E was       effective in developing correct landing techniques, some modifications are needed      to make it more suitable for younger players and coach education by accreditation      courses could be improved to support the implementation of injury prevention      programmes.FAU - Saunders, NAU  - Saunders NAD  - School of Human Movement and Sport Sciences, University of Ballarat, Ballarat,      Australia. n.saunders@ballarat.edu.auFAU - Otago, LAU  - Otago LFAU - Romiti, MAU  - Romiti MFAU - Donaldson, AAU  - Donaldson AFAU - White, PAU  - White PFAU - Finch, CfAU  - Finch CLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20100611PL  - EnglandTA  - Br J Sports MedJT  - British journal of sports medicineJID - 0432520SB  - IMMH  - Athletic Injuries/prevention & controlMH  - *Attitude to HealthMH  - Basketball/*injuriesMH  - Evidence-Based MedicineMH  - HumansMH  - PamphletsMH  - PerceptionMH  - Physical Education and Training/methodsMH  - Professional PracticeMH  - VictoriaEDAT- 2010/06/15 06:00MHDA- 2011/12/13 00:00CRDT- 2010/06/15 06:00PHST- 2010/06/11 [aheadofprint]AID - bjsm.2009.069039 [pii]AID - 10.1136/bjsm.2009.069039 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Br J Sports Med. 2010 Dec;44(15):1128-32. doi: 10.1136/bjsm.2009.069039.

There are two major components that contribute towards 'wheeled      sports' performance: the athlete and the chair. It is the interaction of these      two components that enable wheelchair propulsion and the sporting movements      required within a given sport.

A fourth area will describe on-going work designed to      address the optimisation of wheelchair configurations for wheelchair court      sports. It will focus on four sports: wheelchair racing, wheelchair tennis,      wheelchair basketball and wheelchair rugby. The first topic will discuss the      concept of pushing economy and mechanical efficiency of wheelchair propulsion.      The second topic will show how technology assists the coaching process. The third      topic will illustrate the concept of sports classification, and show how training      volume 'in terms of basketball shooting' may need to be individually assigned and      finally future research within wheelchair team sports and chair configurations      will be examined.FAU - Goosey-Tolfrey, VictoriaAU  - Goosey-Tolfrey VAD  - School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences, The Peter Harrison Centre for      Disability Sport, Loughborough University, Loughborough, UK.      v.l.tolfrey@lboro.ac.ukLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - EnglandTA  - Disabil RehabilJT  - Disability and rehabilitationJID - 9207179SB  - IMMH  - *Athletic PerformanceMH  - Biomechanical PhenomenaMH  - Competitive BehaviorMH  - *Disabled PersonsMH  - Equipment DesignMH  - ErgometryMH  - Exercise TestMH  - Great BritainMH  - Paraplegia/*physiopathology/rehabilitationMH  - Physical Education and Training/*methodsMH  - *SportsMH  - *WheelchairsEDAT- 2010/06/10 06:00MHDA- 2011/05/03 06:00CRDT- 2010/06/10 06:00AID - 10.3109/09638288.2010.491577 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Disabil Rehabil. 2010;32(26):2237-43. doi: 10.3109/09638288.2010.491577.PMID- 20527305OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20100608DCOM- 20100722IS  - 0270-1367 (Print)IS  - 0270-1367 (Linking)VI  - 81IP  - 2DP  - 2010 JunTI  - Variations in the perceptions of peer and coach motivational climate.PG  - 199-211AB  - This study examined (a) variations in the perceptions of peer- and      coach-generated motivational climate within and between teams and (b) individual-      and group-level factors that can account for these variations. Participants were       483 athletes between 12 and 16 years old.

Perceptions of      peer- and coach-generated climate also varied as a function of individual-level      variables, namely athletes' task and ego orientations, gender, and age (only for       coach task-involving and peer ego-involving climate). Moreover, within-team      variations in perceptions of peer- and coach-generated climate as a function of      task and ego orientation levels were identified. Identifying and controlling the       factors that influence perceptions of peer- and coach-generated climate may be      important in strengthening task-involving motivational cues.FAU - Vazou, SpiridoulaAU  - Vazou SAD  - Department of Primary Education, School of Education, University of Crete,      Rethymnon, Greece. svazou@edc.uoc.grLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Res Q Exerc SportJT  - Research quarterly for exercise and sportJID - 8006373SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - ChildMH  - EgoMH  - FemaleMH  - GoalsMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - *MotivationMH  - *Peer GroupMH  - Regression AnalysisMH  - Sports/*psychologyEDAT- 2010/06/10 06:00MHDA- 2010/07/23 06:00CRDT- 2010/06/10 06:00AID - 10.1080/02701367.2010.10599667 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Res Q Exerc Sport. 2010 Jun;81(2):199-211.PMID- 20509091OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20100614DCOM- 20101202IS  - 1466-447X (Electronic)IS  - 0264-0414 (Linking)VI  - 28IP  - 8DP  - 2010 JunTI  - Learning styles favoured by professional, amateur, and recreational athletes in      different sports.PG  - 859-66LID - 10.1080/02640411003734077 [doi]AB  - The aim of this study was to characterize the learning styles of different groups      of athletes grouped according to level of performance and sport. Seventy-one male      athletes completed a questionnaire on learning styles at the beginning of the      2008-2009 training season. Learning styles were assessed using the Honey-Alonso      Learning Styles Questionnaire, and were also converted into learning styles      described by Kolb. The Honey-Alonso learning styles were compared among the      various groups using one-way analysis of variance, and the Kolb learning styles      that were most favoured using a chi-square test. Pearson's correlation      coefficient was used to verify the relationships between variables. No      significant differences were observed in learning styles between different sports      and physical activities. Years of experience did not correlate strongly with      learning styles. With respect to level of performance, the pragmatic component      was significantly lower in professional athletes than amateur and recreational      athletes. These characteristics of learning styles preferred by the athletes      should help coaches and physical trainers to reflect on their role as educators      in the context of planning sports training.FAU - Gonzalez-Haro, CarlosAU  - Gonzalez-Haro CAD  - Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza,      Spain. ghcarlos@gmail.comFAU - Calleja-Gonzalez, JulioAU  - Calleja-Gonzalez JFAU - Escanero, Jesus FAU  - Escanero JFLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - EnglandTA  - J Sports SciJT  - Journal of sports sciencesJID - 8405364SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - Athletes/*psychologyMH  - Chi-Square DistributionMH  - HumansMH  - *LearningMH  - MaleMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Recreation/*psychologyMH  - Sports/*psychologyMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2010/05/29 06:00MHDA- 2010/12/14 06:00CRDT- 2010/05/29 06:00AID - 922555362 [pii]AID - 10.1080/02640411003734077 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Sci. 2010 Jun;28(8):859-66. doi: 10.1080/02640411003734077.PMID- 20479478OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20100518DCOM- 20100610LR  - 20140325IS  - 0895-2779 (Print)IS  - 0895-2779 (Linking)VI  - 32IP  - 2DP  - 2010 AprTI  - The controlling interpersonal style in a coaching context: development and      initial validation of a psychometric scale.PG  - 193-216AB  - This article outlines the development and initial validation of the Controlling      Coach Behaviors Scale (CCBS), a multidimensional self-report measure designed to       assess sports coaches' controlling interpersonal style from the perspective of      self-determination theory (Ryan & Deci, 2002). Study 1 generated a pool of items,      based on past literature and feedback from coaches, athletes, and academic      experts. The factorial structure of the questionnaire was tested using      exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses across Studies 2 and 3. The final      CCBS model in Study 3 comprised 4 factors (controlling use of rewards,      conditional regard, intimidation, and excessive personal control) and was      cross-validated using a third independent sample in Study 4. The scale      demonstrated good content and factorial validity, as well as internal consistency      and invariance across gender and sport type.

Advances in technology have allowed for the development of turf that closely      mimics the properties of natural grass. Overall injury incidence does not differ       between the two surfaces, but unique injury patterns are apparent between the two      surfaces. Differences in shoe-surface interface, in-shoe foot loading patterns,      and impact attenuation may provide insight into the different injury patterns.      Player perceptions of artificial turf vary and may be related to different      physiological demands between the two surfaces. Artificial turf has been      implicated in skin infections, but concerns about other health consequences      related to the synthetic materials have not been proven yet.

A sample of 414 athletes completed a measure of      confidence before performance. Athletes also completed a measure of coping and      subjective performance after competing. Correlational findings revealed that      confidence was positively and significantly associated with subjective      performance. Furthermore, mediational analysis found that coping partly mediated       this relationship. In particular, task-oriented coping (i.e., mental imagery) and      disengagement-oriented coping (i.e., resignation) had positive and negative      mediational effects, respectively. Additionally, athletes who employed mental      imagery generally coped more effectively than those using resignation. These      findings imply mental imagery has the potential not only to improve confidence,      but also subsequent performance, while resignation coping may have the opposite      effect. Overall, these results lend some credence to Vealey's integrated sports      confidence model.CI  - (c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.FAU - Levy, A RAU  - Levy ARAD  - Centre for Sport & Exercise Science, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK.      a.levy@leeds.ac.ukFAU - Nicholls, A RAU  - Nicholls ARFAU - Polman, R C JAU  - Polman RCLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20100310PL  - DenmarkTA  - Scand J Med Sci SportsJT  - Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sportsJID - 9111504SB  - IMMH  - *Adaptation, PsychologicalMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - Athletic Performance/*psychologyMH  - *AttitudeMH  - *Competitive BehaviorMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - ImaginationMH  - MaleMH  - Psychological TestsMH  - Sports/*psychologyMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2010/05/13 06:00MHDA- 2012/02/14 06:00CRDT- 2010/05/13 06:00PHST- 2010/03/10 [aheadofprint]AID - SMS1075 [pii]AID - 10.1111/j.1600-0838.2009.01075.x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Scand J Med Sci Sports. 2011 Oct;21(5):721-9. doi:      10.1111/j.1600-0838.2009.01075.x.

Similar differences based on the competitive environment have been reported with       strength coaches and their training emphases (15,28) but not their leadership      style behaviors. This latter area is important to explore because strength coach       leader behaviors may result in enhanced cooperation, improved communication, and       improved athlete psychological and emotional well-being (14,23,25,27).      Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to examine the differences in      self-perceived leadership styles of National Basketball Association, Division I-A      (DI-A) men's basketball, and Division II (DII) men's basketball strength and      conditioning coaches. The self-perceived leadership styles of 145 men's      basketball strength coaches (National Basketball Association [NBA]=22, DI-A=92,      and DII=31) were obtained using the Revised Leadership Scale for Sport (26,41).      Frequency data about demographics and training methods were also collected. No      significant differences were reported for positive feedback. Otherwise, NBA      strength coaches reported more democratic leadership style behaviors than DI-A      strength coaches. Division I-A strength coaches were found to be more autocratic       than NBA or DII strength coaches. Both NBA and DI-A strength coaches indicated a       higher level of training and instruction than did DII strength coaches. National       Basketball Association strength coaches also reported engaging in more      situational and socially supportive leader behaviors than DI-A and DII strength      coaches. Leader behaviors can positively and negatively impact an athlete (23);      thus, strength coaches need to evaluate their competitive environment and reflect      on the impact of their behaviors and how their approach to leading athletes may      need to vary based on the situation.FAU - Magnusen, Marshall JAU  - Magnusen MJAD  - Department of Sport Management, Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida,      USA. mjm07n@fsu.eduLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Strength Cond ResJT  - Journal of strength and conditioning research / National Strength & Conditioning       AssociationJID - 9415084SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Basketball/*psychologyMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - *LeadershipMH  - MaleMH  - *Muscle StrengthMH  - *Physical Education and TrainingMH  - Physical Fitness/*psychologyMH  - *Resistance TrainingMH  - *Self ConceptEDAT- 2010/05/11 06:00MHDA- 2010/09/15 06:00CRDT- 2010/05/11 06:00AID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181d321ec [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Strength Cond Res. 2010 Jun;24(6):1440-50. doi: 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181d321ec.PMID- 20434307OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20100602DCOM- 20100930LR  - 20111117IS  - 1873-3379 (Electronic)IS  - 0891-4222 (Linking)VI  - 31IP  - 5DP  - 2010 Sep-OctTI  - Could sport specialization influence fitness and health of adults with mental      retardation?PG  - 1070-5LID - 10.1016/j.ridd.2010.04.002 [doi]AB  - Although several studies showed the positive effects of exercise and physical      activity on health and well-being for individuals with ID, there is a lack of      information about the influence of sport specialization on fitness and health      components. Therefore, the aims of this study were to assess: (a) physical      fitness of athletes with intellectual disability (ID) compared with individuals      included in recreational and leisure activity programs (non-athletic people); (b)      contribution of sport specialization on athletes' fitness; and c) correlation of       each fitness variable with subjects' ID levels. Twenty-two track and field, 19      basketball, and 23 non-athletic adults were recruited. Before and after a 9-month      period, all participants performed fitness tests assessing body composition,      flexibility (SR), arm muscular strength (HG), lower and upper-body muscular      strength and endurance (SUP and PUP), explosive leg power (SLJ), cardiovascular      endurance (ST), balance ability (FT), motor coordination (TUGT). The results      showed that participants' weight, BMI and FT were significantly affected by time;      SLJ by activity; ST, HG, PUP, SUP, and TUGT by both time and activity. Only track      and field athletes increased significantly ST. All athletes improved      significantly HG, PUP and SUP, instead non-athletic people decreased      significantly SUP (p<0.01). TUGT improved significantly in track and field      athletes (p<0.05), and decreased significantly in non-athletic people. ID level      was positively correlated to TUGT. Findings of this study showed that physical      activity improved fitness in adult athletes with ID, decreasing health risks.

For over half      a century, rodeo has become a staple of organized sport programmes in high      schools, universities and international competitions. The origins of rodeo grew      from ranch work dating back to the Spanish vaqueros in the 1700s. The sport was      officially organized in 1929 and, by the 1930s, championships were determined and      the sport of rodeo surpassed baseball and auto racing in spectator attendance.      Since then, sponsorship has grown, resulting in extensive worldwide popularity      through major media outlets. Despite growing popularity, few investigations exist      regarding the scientific aspects of the sport. Rodeo competition is an activity      that is basically intermittent in nature, with short periods of highly intense      activity. When considering that experience and, thus, improvement in rodeo is      achieved solely through constant and punishing practices involving actual and      repetitive, human versus livestock competition, the practices closely imitate a      sport-specific form of interval training. Studies, which address the      anthropometric and performance characteristics of rodeo competitors, reveal that       they are comparable to athletes in more traditional sports. The psychological      constructs conducive to performance in rodeo have been varied and limited, with      most research efforts focused on personality characteristics, sensation seeking      and competitive anxiety. Nevertheless, when evaluated relative to higher levels      of traditional sport performance, rodeo participants closely resemble their      mainstream counterparts. Although efforts to quantify this non-traditional sport       are still in the initial stages, information concerning what the optimal fitness       level of rodeo athletes should be for maximal performance levels, in a basically       anaerobic sport, remains to be determined and is an area for future study. Rodeo       performance, as with all sports, is based on a multifactorial array of variables       and, therefore, interdisciplinary efforts encompassing expertise across medicine,      science and coaching are encouraged. Taking a comprehensive approach in the      assessment of athletes, as well as the development and quantification of      event-specific training protocols, may ultimately enhance athletic potential,      minimize opportunity for injury and possibly provide information to coaches and      allied health professionals for the appropriate development and optimal medical      care of these athletes.FAU - Meyers, Michael CAU  - Meyers MCAD  - Department of Health and Human Development, Montana State University, Bozeman,      Montana 59717-2940, USA. meyersgroupinc@gmail.comFAU - Laurent, C Matthew JrAU  - Laurent CM JrLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - New ZealandTA  - Sports MedJT  - Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)JID - 8412297SB  - IMMH  - AnimalsMH  - *AthletesMH  - Athletic Injuries/etiology/prevention & controlMH  - Biomechanical PhenomenaMH  - HorsesMH  - HumansMH  - Sports/*physiology/*psychologyMH  - Young AdultRF  - 134EDAT- 2010/05/04 06:00MHDA- 2010/06/17 06:00CRDT- 2010/05/04 06:00AID - 5 [pii]AID - 10.2165/11531390-000000000-00000 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Sports Med. 2010 May 1;40(5):417-31. doi: 10.2165/11531390-000000000-00000.PMID- 20424407OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20100428DCOM- 20100914IS  - 0091-3847 (Print)IS  - 0091-3847 (Linking)VI  - 38IP  - 1DP  - 2010 AprTI  - Exercise-associated hyponatremia during winter sports.PG  - 101-6LID - 10.3810/psm.2010.04.1767 [doi]AB  - Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) is hyponatremia that occurs <or= 24 hours       after prolonged physical activity. It is a potentially serious complication of      marathons, triathlons, and ultradistance events, and can occur in hot and cold      environments. Clear evidence indicates that EAH is a dilutional hyponatremia      caused by excessive fluid consumption and the inappropriate release of arginine      vasopressin. Cerebral and pulmonary edema can cause serious signs and symptoms,      including altered mental status, respiratory distress, seizures, coma, and death.      Rapid diagnosis and urgent treatment with hypertonic saline is necessary to      prevent severe complications or death. Prevention is based on educating athletes       to avoid excessive drinking before, during, and after exercise.FAU - Stuempfle, Kristin JAU  - Stuempfle KJAD  - Department of Health Sciences, Gettysburg College, Gettysburg, PA 17325, USA.      kstuempf@gettysburg.eduLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Phys SportsmedJT  - The Physician and sportsmedicineJID - 0427461SB  - IMMH  - Cold ClimateMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - Hyponatremia/diagnosis/etiology/*physiopathology/therapyMH  - MaleMH  - Physical Endurance/*physiologyMH  - Sports/*physiologyMH  - Water-Electrolyte Balance/*physiologyEDAT- 2010/04/29 06:00MHDA- 2010/09/15 06:00CRDT- 2010/04/29 06:00AID - 10.3810/psm.2010.04.1767 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Phys Sportsmed. 2010 Apr;38(1):101-6. doi: 10.3810/psm.2010.04.1767.PMID- 20419591OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20100426DCOM- 20100824LR  - 20110419IS  - 1466-447X (Electronic)IS  - 0264-0414 (Linking)VI  - 28IP  - 5DP  - 2010 MarTI  - An analysis of practice activities and instructional behaviours used by youth      soccer coaches during practice: exploring the link between science and      application.PG  - 483-95LID - 10.1080/02640410903582750 [doi]AB  - We examined the practice activities and instructional behaviours employed by 25      youth soccer coaches during 70 different practice sessions. We evaluated the      extent to which these activities and behaviours differ from those shown in      contemporary research to best facilitate skill acquisition. Nine coaches worked      with the under-9 years age group and eight coaches each with the under-13 and      under-16 years age groups; nine of those coaches were employed at the elite      level, nine at the sub-elite level, and seven at the non-elite level. Coaches had      players spend more time in activities that were deemed less relevant to soccer      match performance, termed "training form" (e.g. physical training, technique and       skills practices), than activities deemed more relevant, termed "playing form"      (e.g. small-sided/conditioned games and phase of play activities). Coaches      provided high levels of instruction, feedback, and management, irrespective of      the activity in which players engaged. Few differences in practice activities and      instructional behaviours were reported across skill and age groups, implying the       absence of any notable age- or skill-related progression.

This study investigated      associations between participation in sports and screen-entertainment (as      components of physical activity and sedentary behaviour), and emotional and      behavioural problems in this population. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of      data from 13470 children (50.9% boys) participating in the nationally      representative UK Millennium Cohort Study. Time spent participating in sports      clubs outside of school, and using screen-entertainment, was reported by the      child's mother at child age 5 years, when mental health was also measured using      the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. RESULTS: 45% of children did not      participate in sport clubs and 61% used screen-entertainment for >/= 2 hours per       day. Children who participated in sport had fewer total difficulties; emotional,       conduct, hyperactivity-inattention and peer relationship problems; and more      prosocial behaviours. These relationships were similar in boys and girls. Boys      and girls who used screen-entertainment for any duration, and participated in      sport, had fewer emotional and behavioural problems, and more prosocial      behaviours, than children who used screen-entertainment for >/= 2 hours per day      and did not participate in sport. CONCLUSIONS: Longer durations of      screen-entertainment usage are not associated with mental health problems in      young children. However, our findings suggest an association between sport and      better mental health. Further research based on longitudinal data is required to       examine causal pathways in these associations and to determine the potential role      of this and other forms of physical activity in preventing mental health      disorders.FAU - Griffiths, Lucy JAU  - Griffiths LJAD  - MRC Centre of Epidemiology for Child Health, UCL Institute of Child Health,      London, UK. l.griffiths@ich.ucl.ac.uk.FAU - Dowda, MarshaAU  - Dowda MFAU - Dezateux, CarolAU  - Dezateux CFAU - Pate, RussellAU  - Pate RLA  - engGR  - G106/1221/Medical Research Council/United KingdomPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20100421PL  - EnglandTA  - Int J Behav Nutr Phys ActJT  - The international journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activityJID - 101217089PMC - PMC2867988OID - NLM: PMC2867988EDAT- 2010/04/23 06:00MHDA- 2010/04/23 06:01CRDT- 2010/04/23 06:00PHST- 2009/11/06 [received]PHST- 2010/04/21 [accepted]PHST- 2010/04/21 [aheadofprint]AID - 1479-5868-7-30 [pii]AID - 10.1186/1479-5868-7-30 [doi]PST - epublishSO  - Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act. 2010 Apr 21;7:30. doi: 10.1186/1479-5868-7-30.PMID- 20391082OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20100426DCOM- 20100806IS  - 1466-447X (Electronic)IS  - 0264-0414 (Linking)VI  - 28IP  - 6DP  - 2010 AprTI  - Mental toughness profiles and their relations with achievement goals and sport      motivation in adolescent Australian footballers.PG  - 615-25LID - 10.1080/02640410903582792 [doi]AB  - The aims of this study were to identify the mental toughness profiles of      adolescent Australian footballers and to explore the relations between the mental      toughness clusters and achievement goals and sport motivation. A total of 214      non-elite, male Australian footballers aged 16-18 years (mean = 16.8, s = 0.7)      provided self-reports of mental toughness, achievement goals, and sport      motivation. Cluster analysis supported the presence of two-groups in which      players evidenced moderate and high levels of all four mental toughness      subscales. Significant multivariate effects were observed for achievement goals      and sport motivation with the high mental toughness group favouring both mastery-      and performance-approach goals and self-determined as well as extrinsic      motivational tendencies. The results suggest that adolescent Australian      footballers' self-perceptions of mental toughness fall within two clusters      involving high and moderate forms of all four components, and that these profiles      show varying relations with achievement goals (particularly mastery-approach) and      sport motivation.FAU - Gucciardi, Daniel FAU  - Gucciardi DFAD  - School of Human Movement Studies, The University of Queensland, St. Lucia,      Queensland, Australia. d.gucciardi@uq.edu.auLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - EnglandTA  - J Sports SciJT  - Journal of sports sciencesJID - 8405364SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Athletes/*psychologyMH  - Athletic Performance/*psychologyMH  - Cluster AnalysisMH  - *GoalsMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - *MotivationMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - *Self EfficacyMH  - *SoccerEDAT- 2010/04/15 06:00MHDA- 2010/08/07 06:00CRDT- 2010/04/15 06:00AID - 921273299 [pii]AID - 10.1080/02640410903582792 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Sci. 2010 Apr;28(6):615-25. doi: 10.1080/02640410903582792.PMID- 20380081OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20100409DCOM- 20100415IS  - 0033-2658 (Print)IS  - 0033-2658 (Linking)VI  - 112IP  - 1DP  - 2010TI  - [Participation in sports events by the mentally handicapped--an experience by a      participant].PG  - 32-3FAU - Kuramoto, TakuAU  - Kuramoto TFAU - Takatani, YoshinobuAU  - Takatani YLA  - jpnPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - JapanTA  - Seishin Shinkeigaku ZasshiJT  - Seishin shinkeigaku zasshi = Psychiatria et neurologia JaponicaJID - 9801787SB  - IMMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Schizophrenia/*rehabilitationMH  - *SportsEDAT- 2010/04/13 06:00MHDA- 2010/04/16 06:00CRDT- 2010/04/13 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Seishin Shinkeigaku Zasshi. 2010;112(1):32-3.PMID- 20308701OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20100323DCOM- 20100525IS  - 1555-0265 (Print)IS  - 1555-0265 (Linking)VI  - 5IP  - 1DP  - 2010 MarTI  - Talent development in adolescent team sports: a review.PG  - 103-16AB  - Traditional talent development pathways for adolescents in team sports follow      talent identification procedures based on subjective games ratings and isolated      athletic assessment. Most talent development models are exclusive rather than      inclusive in nature. Subsequently, talent identification may result in      discontentment, premature stratification, or dropout from team sports.      Understanding the multidimensional differences among the requirements of      adolescent and elite adult athletes could provide more realistic goals for      potential talented players. Coach education should include adolescent      development, and rewards for team success at the adolescent level should reflect       the needs of long-term player development. Effective talent development needs to       incorporate physical and psychological maturity, the relative age effect,      objective measures of game sense, and athletic prowess. The influences of media      and culture on the individual, and the competing time demands between various      competitions for player training time should be monitored and mediated where      appropriate. Despite the complexity, talent development is a worthy investment in      professional team sport.FAU - Burgess, Darren JAU  - Burgess DJAD  - Australian Catholic University, Faculty of the Health Sciences, North Sydney,      Australia.FAU - Naughton, Geraldine AAU  - Naughton GALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Int J Sports Physiol PerformJT  - International journal of sports physiology and performanceJID - 101276430SB  - IMMH  - AchievementMH  - AdolescentMH  - Adolescent Development/*physiologyMH  - Age FactorsMH  - Athletic Performance/*physiologyMH  - Competitive BehaviorMH  - Cooperative BehaviorMH  - HumansMH  - *Interpersonal RelationsMH  - Models, EducationalMH  - Models, PsychologicalMH  - Motor Skills/*physiologyMH  - Sports/*physiologyMH  - Task Performance and AnalysisRF  - 66EDAT- 2010/03/24 06:00MHDA- 2010/05/26 06:00CRDT- 2010/03/24 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Int J Sports Physiol Perform. 2010 Mar;5(1):103-16.PMID- 20236412OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20100318DCOM- 20100621IS  - 1746-1561 (Electronic)IS  - 0022-4391 (Linking)VI  - 80IP  - 3DP  - 2010 MarTI  - Evaluation of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's concussion      initiative for high school coaches: "Heads Up: Concussion in High School Sports".PG  - 112-8LID - 10.1111/j.1746-1561.2010.00491.x [doi]AB  - BACKGROUND: To reduce the number of sports-related concussions, the Centers for      Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), with the support of partners and experts in      the field, has developed a tool kit for high school coaches with practical,      easy-to-use concussion-related information. This study explores the success of      the tool kit in changing knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to the      prevention and management of concussions. METHODS: A mail questionnaire was      administered to all eligible high school coaches who received the tool kit.      Follow-up focus groups were conducted for additional information. Both      quantitative data from the surveys and qualitative data from the focus groups      were analyzed to support the objectives of the study. RESULTS: Respondents      self-reported favorable changes in knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward the      prevention and management of concussions.

This transition will require a different set of leadership competencies.      Competencies that reflect relationships, connections with employees, and having      the skill to unleash the human capability at all levels of an organization are      essential. Similar to when a sports team needs a different play book to be      successful, leaders need a new play book. Coaches within the sports team are the       ones who assist players in learning how to adapt to a different set of rules.      They teach the players how to show up differently and how to implement different       plays, with the overall goal of being a successful team. New competencies are      being required to reflect a humanistic approach to leadership. It is critical      that organizations offer coaching as an intervention to all levels of leadership.      This actual case study demonstrates that coaching not only assisted leaders in      learning a new way of leading but also improved overall organizational      effectiveness. The results that have been accomplished through the use of      implementing a 360-degree feedback system, with coaching, reaped overall      organization improvement.CI  - Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to determine whether two-year      coaching interventions conducted in a group of elite young fast bowlers resulted       in fast bowling technique alteration. Selected kinematics of the bowling action      of 14 elite young fast bowlers were measured using an 18 camera Vicon Motion      Analysis system before and after two-year coaching interventions that addressed      specific elements of fast bowling technique. Mann-Whitney tests were used to      determine whether any changes in kinematic variables occurred pre- and      post-intervention between those who had the coaching interventions and those who       didn't. The coaching interventions, when applied, resulted in a more side-on      shoulder alignment at back foot contact (BFC) (p = 0.002) and decreased shoulder       counter-rotation (p = 0.001) however, there was no difference in the degree of      change in back and front knee flexion angles or lower trunk side-flexion. This      study has clearly shown that specific aspects of fast bowling technique are      changeable over a two-year period in elite level fast bowlers and this may be      attributed to coaching intervention.FAU - Ranson, CraigAU  - Ranson CAD  - UK Athletics, Loughborough, UK. cranson@uka.org.ukFAU - King, MarkAU  - King MFAU - Burnett, AngusAU  - Burnett AFAU - Worthington, PeterAU  - Worthington PFAU - Shine, KevinAU  - Shine KLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - ScotlandTA  - Sports BiomechJT  - Sports biomechanics / International Society of Biomechanics in SportsJID - 101151352SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Exercise/*physiologyMH  - HumansMH  - Joints/*physiologyMH  - MaleMH  - Motor Skills/*physiologyMH  - Physical Education and Training/*methodsMH  - Physical Fitness/*physiologyMH  - Range of Motion, Articular/physiologyMH  - Sports/*physiologyMH  - *Task Performance and AnalysisMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2010/02/23 06:00MHDA- 2010/04/03 06:00CRDT- 2010/02/23 06:00AID - 10.1080/14763140903469908 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Sports Biomech. 2009 Nov;8(4):261-74. doi: 10.1080/14763140903469908.PMID- 20136759OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20110112DCOM- 20110602IS  - 1600-0838 (Electronic)IS  - 0905-7188 (Linking)VI  - 21IP  - 1DP  - 2011 FebTI  - Psychological predictors of sport injuries among junior soccer players.PG  - 129-36LID - 10.1111/j.1600-0838.2009.01057.x [doi]AB  - Previous researches have established models that specify psychological factors      that could predict sport injuries. One example is Williams and Andersen's      stress-injury model stressing factors such as anxiety, negative life stress and      few coping resources. The purpose of the current study was to find psychological       factors that could lead to an increased injury risk among junior soccer players,       in addition to construct an empirical model of injury risk factors for soccer      players. The participants were 108 male and female soccer players (m=17, 6)      studying at soccer high schools in southwest Sweden. Five questionnaires were      used, State Trait Anxiety Inventory, Sport Anxiety Scale, Life Events Survey for       Collegiate Athletes, Athletic Coping Skills Inventory-28 and Swedish universities      Scales of Personality. Injury record was collected by athletic trainers at the      schools during a period of 8 months. The result suggested four significant      predictors that together could explain 23% of injury occurrence. The main factors      are life event stress, somatic trait anxiety, mistrust and ineffective coping.      These findings partly support Williams and Andersen's stress-injury model and are      organized into an empirical model. Recommendations are given to sport medicine      teams and coaches concerning issues in sport injury prevention.CI  - (c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.FAU - Johnson, UAU  - Johnson UAD  - Urban Johnson, Centre for Sport and Health Research, Halmstad University,      Halmstad, Sweden. urban.johnson@hh.seFAU - Ivarsson, AAU  - Ivarsson ALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - DenmarkTA  - Scand J Med Sci SportsJT  - Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sportsJID - 9111504SB  - IMMH  - Adaptation, PsychologicalMH  - AdolescentMH  - Analysis of VarianceMH  - Anxiety/*diagnosis/psychologyMH  - Athletic Injuries/*psychologyMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - Life Change EventsMH  - Logistic ModelsMH  - MaleMH  - Predictive Value of TestsMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Soccer/*injuries/*psychologyMH  - Stress, Psychological/*diagnosis/psychologyMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2010/02/09 06:00MHDA- 2011/06/03 06:00CRDT- 2010/02/09 06:00AID - SMS1057 [pii]AID - 10.1111/j.1600-0838.2009.01057.x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Scand J Med Sci Sports. 2011 Feb;21(1):129-36. doi:      10.1111/j.1600-0838.2009.01057.x.PMID- 20131145OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20100430DCOM- 20100813IS  - 1466-447X (Electronic)IS  - 0264-0414 (Linking)VI  - 28IP  - 4DP  - 2010 FebTI  - Sport commitment among competitive female athletes: test of an expanded model.PG  - 423-34LID - 10.1080/02640410903536442 [doi]AB  - In the present study, we examined an expanded model of sport commitment by adding      two determinants (perceived costs and perceived competence) and behavioural      commitment as a consequence of psychological commitment, as well as identifying      psychological commitment as a mediator of relationships between determinants and       behavioural commitment. Competitive female gymnasts (N = 304, age 8-18 years)      completed relevant measures while coaches rated each gymnast's training      behaviours as an indicator of behavioural commitment. Path analysis revealed that      the best fitting model was one in which original determinants (enjoyment,      involvement opportunities, investments, attractive alternatives) and an added      determinant (perceived costs) predicted psychological commitment, in addition to       investments and perceived costs directly predicting behavioural commitment. These      results provide further, but partial, support for the sport commitment model and       also suggest that additional determinants and behavioural consequences be      considered in future research.FAU - Weiss, Windee MAU  - Weiss WMAD  - Athletic Training, University of Northern Iowa, Cedar Falls, Iowa 50614-0244,      USA. windee.weiss@uni.eduFAU - Weiss, Maureen RAU  - Weiss MRFAU - Amorose, Anthony JAU  - Amorose AJLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Validation StudiesPL  - EnglandTA  - J Sports SciJT  - Journal of sports sciencesJID - 8405364SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - *Adolescent BehaviorMH  - Athletes/*psychologyMH  - ChildMH  - *Child BehaviorMH  - *Competitive BehaviorMH  - FemaleMH  - Gymnastics/*psychologyMH  - HumansMH  - *Models, PsychologicalMH  - MotivationEDAT- 2010/02/05 06:00MHDA- 2010/08/14 06:00CRDT- 2010/02/05 06:00AID - 919053667 [pii]AID - 10.1080/02640410903536442 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Sci. 2010 Feb;28(4):423-34. doi: 10.1080/02640410903536442.PMID- 20128366OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20100204DCOM- 20100311IS  - 0899-8493 (Print)IS  - 0899-8493 (Linking)VI  - 21IP  - 4DP  - 2009 NovTI  - Coaching behaviors, motivational climate, and psychosocial outcomes among female       adolescent athletes.PG  - 475-92AB  - Based on Harter's (12,13) competence motivation theory, this study examined the      relationship of coaches' performance feedback and motivational climate with      female athletes' perceived competence, enjoyment, and intrinsic motivation.      Female adolescent soccer players (N = 141) completed measures of relevant      constructs toward the latter part of their season. Canonical correlation analysis      revealed that athletes' perceptions of greater positive and informational      feedback given by coaches in response to successful performance attempts, greater      emphasis placed on a mastery climate, and less emphasis placed on a performance      climate, were significantly related to greater ability perceptions, enjoyment,      and intrinsic motivation. Exploratory analyses also showed that the relationship       between feedback and the psychosocial outcomes may vary as a function of the      perceived motivational climate. Overall, these results suggest that coaching      feedback and motivational climate are important contributors to explaining      adolescent females' continued motivation to participate in sport.FAU - Weiss, Maureen RAU  - Weiss MRAD  - School of Kinesiology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.FAU - Amorose, Anthony JAU  - Amorose AJFAU - Wilko, Anna MarieAU  - Wilko AMLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Multicenter StudyPL  - United StatesTA  - Pediatr Exerc SciJT  - Pediatric exercise scienceJID - 8909729SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Athletic Performance/psychologyMH  - Factor Analysis, StatisticalMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - *Knowledge of Results (Psychology)MH  - *MotivationMH  - Personal SatisfactionMH  - *Self EfficacyMH  - Soccer/*education/*psychologyMH  - *Social SupportMH  - United StatesEDAT- 2010/02/05 06:00MHDA- 2010/03/12 06:00CRDT- 2010/02/05 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Pediatr Exerc Sci. 2009 Nov;21(4):475-92.PMID- 20102049OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20100127DCOM- 20100318IS  - 0350-6134 (Print)IS  - 0350-6134 (Linking)VI  - 33IP  - 4DP  - 2009 DecTI  - Why do we follow sporting events?PG  - 1065-70AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate the motives for following sporting events      and their dependence upon gender and age of spectators. The study was based on a       survey of 1727 adult Slovenes. According to the results the most important      motives could be classified in the category of Dionysian values. This means that       the role of sport in a spectator's life is not that influential; it is much more       considered a source of relaxation and pleasure. Higher values of all motives were      given by men. Women found the motive "National importance of sport" more      important, while the motives "Attraction of sports" and "Competitiveness,      fighting spirit, victory" were placed higher by men. Younger spectators evaluated      the motives higher, with motives "Pleasure, Entertainment" and "Sport Dynamism"      being most important. The data reveal those attributes of sport that have always       caught and will also continue to catch the eye of the spectators.FAU - Pori, MajaAU  - Pori MAD  - Faculty of Sport, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia. maja.pori@fsp.uni-lj.siFAU - Jost, BojanAU  - Jost BFAU - Hosta, MilanAU  - Hosta MFAU - Pori, PrimozAU  - Pori PLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - CroatiaTA  - Coll AntropolJT  - Collegium antropologicumJID - 8003354SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Age FactorsMH  - *AttitudeMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - *MotivationMH  - PleasureMH  - RelaxationMH  - Sex FactorsMH  - SloveniaMH  - Sports/*psychologyEDAT- 2010/01/28 06:00MHDA- 2010/03/20 06:00CRDT- 2010/01/28 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Coll Antropol. 2009 Dec;33(4):1065-70.PMID- 20091620OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20100121DCOM- 20100416LR  - 20140730IS  - 1469-493X (Electronic)IS  - 1361-6137 (Linking)IP  - 1DP  - 2010TI  - Sports and games for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).PG  - CD007171LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD007171.pub2 [doi]AB  - BACKGROUND: Traumatic experiences evoke emotions such as fear, anxiety and      distress and may encourage avoidance of similar situations in the future. For a      proportion of those exposed to a traumatic event, this emotional reaction becomes      uncontrollable and can develop into Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)      (Breslau 2001). Most of those diagnosed with PTSD fully recover while a small      proportion develop a chronic PTSD a year after the event (First 2004). Sports and      games may be able to alleviate symptoms of PTSD. OBJECTIVES: PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:      1. To assess the effectiveness of sports, and games in alleviating and/or      diminishing the symptoms of PTSD when compared to usual care or other      interventions. SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: 2. To assess the effectiveness of different      types of sports and games in alleviating and/or diminishing symptoms of PTSD.      SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis      Controlled Trials Registers (CCDAN-CTR) were searched up to June 2008.The      following databases were searched up to June 2008: the Cochrane Central registry       of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; EMBASE; CINAHL; PsycINFO. Reference lists of      relevant papers were searched and experts in the field were contacted to      determine if other studies were available. SELECTION CRITERIA: To be included,      participants had to be diagnosed with PTSD using criteria outlined in the      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM IV) and/or ICD      criteria. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that considered one or more      well-specified sports or games for alleviating and/or diminishing symptoms of      PTSD were included.Sports, and games were defined as any organized physical      activity done alone or with a group and non-physical activities such as computer       games and card games done alone or with a group. Psychological interventions such      as music therapy, art therapy and play therapy and behavioural therapy were      excluded. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers (SL and MD) separately      checked the titles and abstracts of the search results to determine which studies      met the pre-determined inclusion criteria. A flow chart was used to guide the      selection process. No studies met the inclusion criteria. MAIN RESULTS: The      search strategy identified five papers but none of the studies met inclusion      criteria. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: No studies met the inclusion criteria. More      research is therefore required before a fair assessment can be made of the      effectiveness of sports and games in alleviating symptoms of PTSD.FAU - Lawrence, SueAU  - Lawrence SAD  - c/o Lifespan Research Group, Royal Holloway, University of London, 11 Bedford      Square, London, WC1B 3RF, UK.FAU - De Silva, MaryAU  - De Silva MFAU - Henley, RobertAU  - Henley RLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20100120PL  - EnglandTA  - Cochrane Database Syst RevJT  - The Cochrane database of systematic reviewsJID - 100909747SB  - IMMH  - Chronic DiseaseMH  - HumansMH  - *SportsMH  - Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/psychology/*therapyMH  - *Video GamesRF  - 48EDAT- 2010/01/22 06:00MHDA- 2010/04/17 06:00CRDT- 2010/01/22 06:00AID - 10.1002/14651858.CD007171.pub2 [doi]PST - epublishSO  - Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2010 Jan 20;(1):CD007171. doi:      10.1002/14651858.CD007171.pub2.PMID- 20058398OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20100108DCOM- 20100226IS  - 0091-3847 (Print)IS  - 0091-3847 (Linking)VI  - 37IP  - 3DP  - 2009 OctTI  - Psychiatric conditions in sports: diagnosis, treatment, and quality of life.PG  - 29-34AB  - The social stigma surrounding psychiatric illness may prevent athletes from      seeking counseling, psychotherapy, medication, or other treatment when needed.      Few controlled studies on athletes exist to guide the team physician, clinician,       or psychiatrist who must deal with diagnostic issues. Management involves setting      realistic goals, educating as well as inducing the patient into treatment,      soliciting support from family or significant others, and delivering appropriate       treatment (the most difficult task). The objective is to improve performance and       quality of life. Confidentiality issues are paramount during diagnosis and      treatment.

The Zurich Consensus statement is designed to build on the principles outlined in      the original Vienna and Prague documents and to develop further conceptual      understanding of this problem using a formal consensus-based approach. A detailed      description of the consensus process is outlined at the end of this document      under the "background" section (see Section 11). This document is developed for      use by physicians, therapists, certified athletic trainers, health professionals,      coaches and other people involved in the care of injured athletes, whether at the      recreational, elite, or professional level.

Participants (n = 76)      recruited from four semi- professional soccer and basketball teams completed      cohesiveness and efficacy questionnaires who. Data were analyzed through a      correlational methodology. Results indicated significant correlations between      self-efficacy and task cohesion and social cohesion. Regression analysis results       suggest task cohesion positively related to coaches and teammate's perception of       efficacy. These results have implications for practitioners in terms of the      importance of team building to enhance team cohesion and feelings of efficacy.

The      study's participants comprised 336 Portuguese coaches from twenty-two sports. A      questionnaire was used to identify coaches' demographic characteristics and      representations about their preferred sources of coaching knowledge. MANOVA using      Tukey's HSD test was used to compare groups. The results highlighted that coaches      perceived that coaching knowledge is built from a broad range of sources from      personal coaching and playing experiences to more explicit formal, informal and      non-formal learning situations. Results indicated that the coaches ascribed more       importance to experiential sources such as working with experts, learning by      doing, interacting with peer coaches and attending informal seminars and clinics,      than to the formal learning situations provided by the national coaching      certification programs. Differences, however, were found in that coaches who had       a greater background within higher education (physical) and sport valued informal      and non-formal learning sources more than did coaches who were defined as not      coming from an academic background. The findings point to the importance of      developing new learning, experientially-based, opportunities within the      Portuguese context, where curricula content continues to be delivered via      didactic means. Key pointsCoaches recognized that learning is obtained from a      broad range of sources of coaching knowledge and each source has a particular      role in the development of a coach.Experiential guided sources reached more      importance to coaches as working with experts, learning by doing, attending      seminars/clinics outside of the formal system and interaction with peers were the      most acknowledged.The only source that is related to formal learning, national      certification programs, was recognized as the less importance than all informal      and non-formal learning situations.The profile of the source of coaching      knowledge showed to be stable among coaches as only the academic education level       differentiated the coaches' perceptions.FAU - Mesquita, IsabelAU  - Mesquita IAD  - Centre of Research, Education, Innovation and Intervention in Sport, University      of Porto, Sport Faculty , Portugal.FAU - Isidro, SofiaAU  - Isidro SFAU - Rosado, AntonioAU  - Rosado ALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20100901PL  - TurkeyTA  - J Sports Sci MedJT  - Journal of sports science & medicineJID - 101174629PMC - PMC3761720OID - NLM: PMC3761720OTO - NOTNLMOT  - coaches’ perceptionsOT  - coaching educationOT  - coaching scienceOT  - learning situationsEDAT- 2010/01/01 00:00MHDA- 2010/01/01 00:01CRDT- 2013/10/24 06:00PHST- 2010/09 [ecollection]PHST- 2010/04/01 [received]PHST- 2010/07/18 [accepted]PHST- 2010/09/01 [epublish]PST - epublishSO  - J Sports Sci Med. 2010 Sep 1;9(3):480-9. eCollection 2010.PMID- 24149387OWN - NLMSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINEDA  - 20131023DCOM- 20131023LR  - 20140124IS  - 1303-2968 (Electronic)IS  - 1303-2968 (Linking)VI  - 9IP  - 1DP  - 2010TI  - Coaches' perceptions of competence and acknowledgement of training needs related       to professional competences.PG  - 62-70AB  - The purpose of the present study was to examine coaches' perceptions of      competence and acknowledgement of training needs related to professional      competences according to the professional experience and academic education. The       participants were 343 coaches from several sports, who answered to a      questionnaire that includes a scale focused on perceptions of competence and      another scale on acknowledgment of training needs. An exploratory factor analysis      with Maximum Likelihood Factoring was used with Oblimin rotation for the      identification of emergent factors. Comparison on coaches' perceptions in      function of coaching experience and coaches' academic background were made      applying One-way ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc multiple comparisons. Factor analysis      on coaches' perceptions of competence and acknowledgement of training needs made       apparent three main areas of competences, i.e. competences related to annual and       multi-annual planning; competences related to orientation towards practice and      competition; and personal and coaching education competences. Coaches'      perceptions were influenced by their experience, as low experienced coaches rated      themselves at lower levels of competence and with more training needs; also      coaches with high education, in Physical Education or others, perceived      themselves as more competent than coaches with no higher education. Finally, the       majority of the coaches perceived themselves to be competent but, nevertheless,      they indicated to have training needs, which brings an important feedback to      coach education. This suggests that coaches are interested in increasing their      knowledge and competence in a broad range of areas which should be considered in       future coach education programs. Key pointsCoaches' perceptions of competence and      acknowledgement of training needs resulted in three main areas: competences      related to annual and multi-annual planning, competences related to practice and       competition orientation and, finally, personal and coaching education      competences.The professional tasks that coaches had the most need in performing      were related to the training orientation.Coaches with higher education degrees      (P.E. or others) perceive themselves as more competent than coaches with no      higher education.Low experienced coaches perceived themselves less competent than      high experienced coaches. Also, they pointed out more training needs in issues      related to practice and competition orientation, and annual and multi-annual      planning.FAU - Santos, SofiaAU  - Santos SAD  - Centre of Research, Education, Innovation and Intervention in Sport, University      of Porto, Sport Faculty Portugal.FAU - Mesquita, IsabelAU  - Mesquita IFAU - Graca, AmandioAU  - Graca AFAU - Rosado, AntonioAU  - Rosado ALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20100301PL  - TurkeyTA  - J Sports Sci MedJT  - Journal of sports science & medicineJID - 101174629PMC - PMC3737976OID - NLM: PMC3737976OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Coaching educationOT  - perceptions of competenceOT  - professional competencesOT  - science of coachingOT  - training needsEDAT- 2010/01/01 00:00MHDA- 2010/01/01 00:01CRDT- 2013/10/24 06:00PHST- 2010/03 [ecollection]PHST- 2009/11/16 [received]PHST- 2009/12/31 [accepted]PHST- 2010/03/01 [epublish]PST - epublishSO  - J Sports Sci Med. 2010 Mar 1;9(1):62-70. eCollection 2010.PMID- 24149380OWN - NLMSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINEDA  - 20131023DCOM- 20131023LR  - 20140124IS  - 1303-2968 (Electronic)IS  - 1303-2968 (Linking)VI  - 9IP  - 1DP  - 2010TI  - Prediction of sport adherence through the influence of autonomy-supportive      coaching among spanish adolescent athletes.PG  - 8-14AB  - The purpose of this study was to test a motivational model of the coach-athlete      relationship, based on self-determination theory and on the hierarchical model of      intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. The sample comprised of 608 athletes (ages of      12-17 years) completed the following measures: interest in athlete's input,      praise for autonomous behavior, perceived autonomy, intrinsic motivation, and the      intention to be physically active. Structural equation modeling results      demonstrated that interest in athletes' input and praise for autonomous behavior       predicted perceived autonomy, and perceived autonomy positively predicted      intrinsic motivation. Finally, intrinsic motivation predicted the intention to be      physically active in the future. The results are discussed in relation to the      importance of the climate of autonomy support created by the coach on intrinsic      motivation and adherence to sport by adolescent athletes. Further, the results      provide information related to the possible objectives of future interventions      for the education of coaches, with the goal of providing them with tools and      strategies to favor the development of intrinsic motivation among their athletes.      In conclusion, the climate of autonomy support created by the coach can predict      the autonomy perceived by the athletes which predicts the intrinsic motivation      experienced by the athletes, and therefore, their adherence to athletic practice.

Here, we address the psychological impact of these      demands via a critical review of the literature pertaining to stress in sport      coaches. The narrative is divided into three main sections: (1) conceptual and      definitional issues, (2) theoretical and empirical issues, and (3) implications      for applied practice. The review focuses on the environmental stressors that      coaches encounter, their appraisals of and responses to these demands, and the      impact this has on their personal well-being and job performance. The influence      of various personal and situational characteristics is also discussed. A key      message to emerge from this review is that the potential health and performance      costs of psychological stress to sports coaches are significant. The rapid rate      of change in contemporary sport and the dynamic nature of stress mean that stress      in coaches is an ongoing problem that needs to be monitored and addressed.FAU - Fletcher, DavidAU  - Fletcher DAD  - School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences, Loughborough University, Epinal      Way, Loughborough LE11 3TU, UK. d.fletcher2@lboro.ac.ukFAU - Scott, MichaelAU  - Scott MLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - EnglandTA  - J Sports SciJT  - Journal of sports sciencesJID - 8405364SB  - IMMH  - *Burnout, ProfessionalMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Models, PsychologicalMH  - Sports/*psychologyMH  - *Stress, PsychologicalRF  - 57EDAT- 2009/12/26 06:00MHDA- 2010/08/13 06:00CRDT- 2009/12/26 06:00AID - 918061683 [pii]AID - 10.1080/02640410903406208 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Sci. 2010 Jan;28(2):127-37. doi: 10.1080/02640410903406208.PMID- 20034315OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20091225DCOM- 20100126IS  - 0300-8134 (Print)IS  - 0300-8134 (Linking)VI  - 38IP  - 1DP  - 2009 JunTI  - How the number of years of sports experience and the frequency of sports      activities can influence the quality of life of people with challenges.PG  - 19-26AB  - The present study focused on the users of sports centres for people with      challenges to identify the relationship between sports activities and quality of       life (QOL) of the users. A centre established in H Prefecture in 1996 (Centre H)       and another in T Prefecture in 2006 (Centre T) were studied to find out how      differences in the number of years of sports experience and frequency of sports      activities could affect QOL scores of the 36-Item Medical Outcomes Study      Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). The examination of the relationship between the      number of years of sports experience and the total QOL scores of the respondents       at both centres revealed significantly better QOL scores on the bodily pain (BP)       and role emotional (RE) scales among the respondents with three or more years of       sports experience, compared to those with less than three years of sports      experience. On the whole, the higher the number of years of sports experience and      the greater the frequency of sports activities, the better the QOL scores were.      These results suggest that sports activities contribute greatly to the      improvement of the everyday QOL of challenged individuals and long years of      frequent sports activities have a beneficial impact on the QOL of      physically-challenged individuals.FAU - Nakashima, ShiroAU  - Nakashima SAD  - Graduate School of Integrated Arts and Sciences, Hiroshima University, 1-7-1      Kagamiyama, Higashi-Hiroshima 739-8521, Japan. d062154@hiroshima-u.ac.jpFAU - Miki, YumikoAU  - Miki YFAU - Miki, TomoyukiAU  - Miki TFAU - Wang, HongliAU  - Wang HFAU - Yamasaki, MasahiroAU  - Yamasaki MLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Multicenter StudyPL  - JapanTA  - J Hum Ergol (Tokyo)JT  - Journal of human ergologyJID - 0364267SB  - IMMH  - *Disabled Persons/psychology/rehabilitationMH  - *Health PromotionMH  - Health StatusMH  - Health SurveysMH  - HumansMH  - JapanMH  - Mental HealthMH  - Pain/prevention & controlMH  - *Quality of LifeMH  - Social AdjustmentMH  - *SportsMH  - Time FactorsEDAT- 2009/12/26 06:00MHDA- 2010/01/27 06:00CRDT- 2009/12/26 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Hum Ergol (Tokyo). 2009 Jun;38(1):19-26.PMID- 20001370OWN - NLMSTAT- PublisherDA  - 20091216IS  - 1440-1665 (Electronic)IS  - 1039-8562 (Linking)VI  - 17IP  - 6DP  - 2009 DecTI  - Evaluation of a mental health literacy training program for junior sporting      clubs.PG  - 475-479AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to describe and evaluate a training program       designed to improve mental health literacy in junior sporting club coaches and      leaders. It was anticipated that participants would demonstrate an improvement in      knowledge, confidence, and attitudes in relation to mental disorders and help      seeking. Methods: A training program called Read the Play was delivered to 40      participants from junior AFL football and netball leagues in the Barwon region of      Victoria. The effects of the training were evaluated using pre- and      post-questionnaires. Results: The course led to significant improvement in      knowledge about mental disorders, increased confidence in helping someone with a       mental disorder and more positive attitudes towards people with mental disorders.      Conclusions: Training programs delivered within sporting settings may be      effective in improving mental health literacy. Future evaluations would benefit      from assessing whether these changes are sustained over time and whether trainees      subsequently assist young club members to seek appropriate professional help.FAU - Bapat, SwagataAU  - Bapat SAD  - Manager of Training and Development, ORYGEN Youth Health, Parkville, VIC,      Australia.FAU - Jorm, AnthonyAU  - Jorm AFAU - Lawrence, KatherineAU  - Lawrence KLA  - ENGPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLETA  - Australas PsychiatryJT  - Australasian psychiatry : bulletin of Royal Australian and New Zealand College of      PsychiatristsJID - 9613603EDAT- 2009/12/17 06:00MHDA- 2009/12/17 06:00CRDT- 2009/12/17 06:00AID - 10.1080/10398560902964586 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Australas Psychiatry. 2009 Dec;17(6):475-479.PMID- 19996991OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20100420DCOM- 20100804IS  - 1530-0315 (Electronic)IS  - 0195-9131 (Linking)VI  - 42IP  - 5DP  - 2010 MayTI  - Does sports club participation contribute to health-related quality of life?PG  - 1022-8LID - 10.1249/MSS.0b013e3181c3adaa [doi]AB  - Given the social nature of participation in sport, we hypothesized that club      sports participants would have greater well-being and quality of life than      participants in other forms of physical activity (PA). PURPOSE: The purpose of      this study was to examine health-related quality of life and life satisfaction in      women who participate in three contrasting forms of PA: club sport, gym      activities, and walking. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of the      relationship between type of PA setting and measures of health-related quality of      life (Short-Form Health Survey [SF-36]) and life satisfaction in 818 women living      in rural Victoria, Australia, in 2007. Data were also compared with those from a       normative sample of 2345 women. RESULTS: After adjustment for potential      confounders (age, education, marital status, children aged <16 yr, perceived      financial stress, and level of recreational PA), four of the eight SF-36      subscales, the SF-36 mental health component summary score, and life satisfaction      were significantly higher in the club sport group than that in the other groups.       CONCLUSION: Although cross-sectional research cannot establish causal links, the       results suggest that participation in club sport may enhance the health benefits       of PA.FAU - Eime, Rochelle MAU  - Eime RMAD  - School of Human Movement and Sport Sciences, University of Ballarat, Ballarat,      Australia.FAU - Harvey, Jack TAU  - Harvey JTFAU - Brown, Wendy JAU  - Brown WJFAU - Payne, Warren RAU  - Payne WRLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - United StatesTA  - Med Sci Sports ExercJT  - Medicine and science in sports and exerciseJID - 8005433SB  - IMSB  - SMH  - AdultMH  - Cross-Sectional StudiesMH  - FemaleMH  - *Health StatusMH  - HumansMH  - Mental HealthMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Personal SatisfactionMH  - *Quality of LifeMH  - Rural PopulationMH  - *SportsMH  - VictoriaMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2009/12/10 06:00MHDA- 2010/08/05 06:00CRDT- 2009/12/10 06:00AID - 10.1249/MSS.0b013e3181c3adaa [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Med Sci Sports Exerc. 2010 May;42(5):1022-8. doi: 10.1249/MSS.0b013e3181c3adaa.PMID- 19966569OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20100113DCOM- 20100325IS  - 1531-698X (Electronic)IS  - 1040-8703 (Linking)VI  - 22IP  - 1DP  - 2010 FebTI  - Hockey injuries: a pediatric sport update.PG  - 54-60LID - 10.1097/MOP.0b013e3283350f32 [doi]AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Ice hockey is a fast-paced sport played by an increasing      number of children and teens across the nation. RECENT FINDINGS: The risk of      injury in youth hockey is high due to contact from body checking. Youth hockey      programs need to educate players, coaches, and parents about the importance of      knowing and following the rules as well as the dangers of body checking another      player from behind.

The method      produces a continuous picture of participation across the life-course, allowing      key transition periods in the life-course to be identified and the determinants      of transitions to be analysed with multivariate models. Late adolescence emerges       as an important period, when many people drop out from team sports, especially      females. Participation in adulthood mostly involves taking up individual sports      and exercise activities. The likelihood of making this transition is strongly      associated with socio-economic status. Transitions in activity during adulthood      do not display significant sex differences, suggesting that the gender gap for      involvement in sports and exercise has its roots in childhood. The method also      allows age and cohort effects to be distinguished, revealing higher participation      among more recent cohorts. The findings must be interpreted carefully, since they      are reliant on the accuracy of personal recall. Yet they have implications for      how physical activity policy applies over the life-course, suggesting possible      returns to targeting lower socio-economic groups in early adulthood, to offering       a broader range of activities to young females, and to researching and promoting       those activities most likely to be of interest to current young adults as they      age.CI  - 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Many of these ethical issues arise because the      traditional relationship between doctor and patient is distorted or absent. The      emergence of a doctor-patient-team triad has created a scenario in which the      team's priority can conflict with or even replace the doctor's primary obligation      to player well-being. As a result, the customary ethical norms that provide      guidelines for most forms of clinical practice, such as patient autonomy and      confidentiality, are not easily translated in the field of sports medicine.      Sports doctors are frequently under intense pressure, whether implicit or      explicit, from management, coaches, trainers and agents, to improve performance      of the athlete in the short term rather than considering the long-term sequelae      of such decisions. A myriad of ethical dilemmas are encountered, and for many of       these dilemmas there are no right answers. In this article, a number of ethical      principles and how they relate to sports medicine are discussed. To conclude, a      list of guidelines has been drawn up to offer some support to doctors facing an      ethical quandary, the most important of which is 'do not abdicate your      responsibility to the individual player.''I am in blood Stepp'd in so far that,      should I wade no more, Returning would be as tedious as to go o'er' -Macbeth: Act      III, Scene IV, William Shakespeare.FAU - Devitt, Brian MeldanAU  - Devitt BMAD  - Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital, Dublin, Ireland. bdevitt@hotmail.comFAU - McCarthy, ConorAU  - McCarthy CLA  - engPT  - Historical ArticlePT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20091129PL  - EnglandTA  - Br J Sports MedJT  - British journal of sports medicineJID - 0432520SB  - IMMH  - Ethics, MedicalMH  - History, 19th CenturyMH  - History, AncientMH  - HumansMH  - Practice Guidelines as TopicMH  - Professional AutonomyMH  - Professional Misconduct/ethicsMH  - Professional Practice/*ethicsMH  - Sports Medicine/*ethics/historyEDAT- 2009/12/02 06:00MHDA- 2011/04/19 06:00CRDT- 2009/12/02 06:00PHST- 2009/11/29 [aheadofprint]AID - bjsm.2009.068056 [pii]AID - 10.1136/bjsm.2009.068056 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Br J Sports Med. 2010 Feb;44(3):175-8. doi: 10.1136/bjsm.2009.068056.

DESIGN: Prospective injury surveillance study. SETTING: Eighteen      United States high schools PARTICIPANTS: Athletic trainers and varsity coaches      for football, boys' and girls' soccer, and boys' and girls' basketball. MAIN      OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Quantity and quality of exposure and injury reports. RESULTS:      All enrolled ATs participated, compared with only 43.0% of enrolled coaches.      Participating ATs submitted 96.7% of expected exposure reports, whereas      participating coaches submitted only 36.5%. All ATs reported athlete exposures      correctly, compared with only 2 in 3 coaches. Participating ATs submitted 338      injury reports; participating coaches submitted only 55 (16.3% of the 338      submitted by ATs). Injury patterns differed between AT-submitted and      coach-submitted injury reports, with ATs reporting a higher proportion of ankle      injuries and coaches reporting a higher proportion of knee injuries. The reports       submitted by ATs and coaches for the same injury had low agreement for diagnosis       and time loss, with only 63.2% and 55.3% of pairs, respectively, providing the      same response. The ATs lacked more responses for demographic questions, whereas      coaches lacked more responses regarding the need for surgery. CONCLUSIONS:      Whenever possible, ATs should be the primary data reporters in large, national      studies. In high schools without access to an AT, researchers must be willing to       devote significant time and resources to achieving high participation and      compliance from other reporters.FAU - Yard, Ellen EAU  - Yard EEAD  - The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH, USA.FAU - Collins, Christy LAU  - Collins CLFAU - Comstock, R DawnAU  - Comstock RDLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - United StatesTA  - J Athl TrainJT  - Journal of athletic trainingJID - 9301647SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Athletic Injuries/*epidemiologyMH  - Basketball/injuriesMH  - Feasibility StudiesMH  - FemaleMH  - Football/injuriesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Population Surveillance/methodsMH  - Prospective StudiesMH  - Research DesignMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Schools/*statistics & numerical dataMH  - Soccer/injuriesMH  - Sports Medicine/*statistics & numerical dataMH  - United States/epidemiologyPMC - PMC2775367OID - NLM: PMC2775367OTO - NOTNLMOT  - injury epidemiologyOT  - methodologiesEDAT- 2009/11/17 06:00MHDA- 2010/04/07 06:00CRDT- 2009/11/14 06:00AID - 10.4085/1062-6050-44.6.645 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Athl Train. 2009 Nov-Dec;44(6):645-52. doi: 10.4085/1062-6050-44.6.645.PMID- 19875270OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20091113DCOM- 20100127LR  - 20111117IS  - 1873-3379 (Electronic)IS  - 0891-4222 (Linking)VI  - 31IP  - 1DP  - 2010 Jan-FebTI  - Effects of different variations of mental and physical practice on sport skill      learning in adolescents with mental retardation.PG  - 81-6LID - 10.1016/j.ridd.2009.07.022 [doi]AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of five variations of      imagery and physical practice on learning of Basketball free throws in      adolescents with mental retardation (AWMR). Forty AWMR were randomly assigned to       five groups and performed a variation of practice: physical practice, mental      practice, physical practice followed by mental practice, mental practice followed      by physical practice, and no practice. The groups exercised the task for 24      sessions. Following training, posttest and retention test were taken. All      variations of practice resulted in performance improvement, yet the mental      practice followed by physical practice resulted in better improvement. The      results suggest that mental practice associated with physical practice results in      an outstanding performance improvement in AWMR.FAU - Hemayattalab, RasoolAU  - Hemayattalab RAD  - Department of Physical Education and Sport Sciences, University of Tehran,      Tehran, Iran. rhemayat@ut.ac.ir.comFAU - Movahedi, AhmadrezaAU  - Movahedi ALA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Randomized Controlled TrialDEP - 20091028PL  - United StatesTA  - Res Dev DisabilJT  - Research in developmental disabilitiesJID - 8709782SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - *Athletic PerformanceMH  - Basketball/*psychologyMH  - ChildMH  - Education of Intellectually DisabledMH  - ElectromyographyMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - *ImaginationMH  - Intellectual Disability/*diagnosis/psychology/rehabilitationMH  - MaleMH  - *Motor SkillsMH  - *Practice (Psychology)MH  - Retention (Psychology)EDAT- 2009/10/31 06:00MHDA- 2010/01/28 06:00CRDT- 2009/10/31 06:00PHST- 2009/07/22 [received]PHST- 2009/07/27 [accepted]PHST- 2009/10/28 [aheadofprint]AID - S0891-4222(09)00121-8 [pii]AID - 10.1016/j.ridd.2009.07.022 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Res Dev Disabil. 2010 Jan-Feb;31(1):81-6. doi: 10.1016/j.ridd.2009.07.022.

Fatal heat injury is relatively rare (0.20 per 100 000      player-seasons in US high school football) and there are very limited data on      non-fatal incidence. Expert recommendations for prevention include gradual      acclimatisation of youth athletes to hot conditions, reductions in activity in      hot and humid conditions, wearing light and light-coloured clothing, careful      monitoring of athletes for signs of heat injury to facilitate immediate      detection, having the resources to immediately and rapidly cool affected      athletes, and education of athletes, care givers, and coaches about heat injury.       Although a base of observational case data, physiological information, and expert      opinion exists, the science surrounding this field is devoid of health      communication and health behaviour research, and there is a pressing need for      analytical studies to evaluate intervention programmes and/or identify new risk      factors. There is also a need for ongoing data collection on heat injury      incidence and on the knowledge, attitudes and behaviours towards heat injury      among youth athletes, their care givers and their coaches.FAU - Marshall, S WAU  - Marshall SWAD  - Department of Epidemiology, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University      of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7435, USA.      smarshall@unc.edu.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20091025PL  - EnglandTA  - Br J Sports MedJT  - British journal of sports medicineJID - 0432520SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - ChildMH  - Environmental ExposureMH  - Fluid TherapyMH  - Heat Stress Disorders/etiology/mortality/*prevention & controlMH  - Hot TemperatureMH  - HumansMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - *SportsEDAT- 2009/10/28 06:00MHDA- 2011/04/05 06:00CRDT- 2009/10/28 06:00PHST- 2009/10/25 [aheadofprint]AID - bjsm.2009.068171 [pii]AID - 10.1136/bjsm.2009.068171 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Br J Sports Med. 2010 Jan;44(1):8-12. doi: 10.1136/bjsm.2009.068171.

This      article examines how the demarcation of Australian institutional spaces along      gender divisions was also mirrored by the gender-specific recreational activities      provided in purpose-built facilities. Using Australian examples I demonstrate how      the main forms of recreation-that is divine service, music and dance, and      sport-were justified to governments on medical grounds. Some designated      recreational spaces even offered select female and male patients the opportunity       to mix under medical supervision. Recreation was therapeutic because of its      psychological, physical, social, and moral benefits, and government authorities      funded the construction of costly chapels, recreation halls, and sports grounds      expressly for this medical purpose.FAU - MacKinnon, DollyAU  - MacKinnon DAD  - University of Melbourne.LA  - engPT  - Historical ArticlePT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - AustraliaTA  - Health HistoryJT  - Health and historyJID - 100888373SB  - QISMH  - AustraliaMH  - Dance Therapy/*historyMH  - History, 19th CenturyMH  - History, 20th CenturyMH  - Hospitals, Psychiatric/*historyMH  - HumansMH  - Mental Disorders/*history/therapyMH  - Music Therapy/*historyMH  - Recreation/psychologyMH  - Religion/*historyMH  - Sports/*historyEDAT- 2009/10/27 06:00MHDA- 2009/12/30 06:00CRDT- 2009/10/27 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Health History. 2009;11(1):128-48.PMID- 19842541OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20091021DCOM- 20091201IS  - 0895-2779 (Print)IS  - 0895-2779 (Linking)VI  - 31IP  - 4DP  - 2009 AugTI  - Individual, team, and coach predictors of players' likelihood to aggress in youth      soccer.PG  - 425-43AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine personal and socioenvironmental factors       of players' likelihood to aggress. Participants were youth soccer players (N =      258) and their coaches (N = 23) from high school and club teams. Players      completed the Judgments About Moral Behavior in Youth Sports Questionnaire      (JAMBYSQ; Stephens, Bredemeier, & Shields, 1997), which assessed athletes' stage       of moral development, team norm for aggression, and self-described likelihood to       aggress against an opponent. Coaches were administered the Coaching Efficacy      Scale (CES; Feltz, Chase, Moritz, & Sullivan, 1999). Using multilevel modeling,      results demonstrated that the team norm for aggression at the athlete and team      level were significant predictors of athletes' self likelihood to aggress scores.      Further, coaches' game strategy efficacy emerged as a positive predictor of their      players' self-described likelihood to aggress.

Results      indicated that coaches felt alcohol use was less of a problem among high school      student-athletes than high school students in general. Only one-third of coaches       (39%) worked at a school requiring them to talk to their athletes about alcohol      use. Coaches most likely to be involved in alcohol prevention were those who had       attended an alcohol prevention class/workshop and those who worked for schools      with strong alcohol prevention policies and schools that required them to talk      with athletes about alcohol use.FAU - King, Keith AAU  - King KAAD  - Health Promotion and Education Program, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH       45221-0068, USA. keith.king@uc.eduFAU - Dowdall, Mark PAU  - Dowdall MPFAU - Wagner, Donald IAU  - Wagner DILA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - NetherlandsTA  - J Community HealthJT  - Journal of community healthJID - 7600747SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - *Adolescent BehaviorMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Alcohol Drinking/*prevention & control/psychologyMH  - *Athletes/education/psychology/statistics & numerical dataMH  - *Attitude to HealthMH  - Data CollectionMH  - FemaleMH  - *Health EducationMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - SportsMH  - *TeachingMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2009/10/20 06:00MHDA- 2010/03/06 06:00CRDT- 2009/10/20 06:00AID - 10.1007/s10900-009-9190-4 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Community Health. 2010 Feb;35(1):68-75. doi: 10.1007/s10900-009-9190-4.PMID- 19831110OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20091016DCOM- 20091125IS  - 0031-5125 (Print)IS  - 0031-5125 (Linking)VI  - 109IP  - 1DP  - 2009 AugTI  - Understanding the relationship between perceived development of the competition      plan and sport performance: mediating effects of self-efficacy and state      depression.PG  - 304-14AB  - The effectiveness of competition plans on athletes' performance outcomes was      assessed while accounting for the mediating influence of state depression and      self-efficacy. Competition plans reflect an integrated and personalized plan that      consists of a set of decision-making rules based on the principles of      self-control and self-efficacy development that are tailored to the specific      demands of an upcoming competition in a given sport and highly individualized to       take into account the specific qualities of the athlete. The relationship between      the development of a competition plan and athletes' evaluations of their      competitive outcomes was of interest. 11 elite athletes participating in 104      competitions involving 7 different sports participated. Results support the      beneficial effect of a well-developed competition plan in affecting athletes'      perceived performance; the relationship was mediated by state depression and      self-efficacy. Coaches and sport psychologists should devote increased attention       to the development and refinement of athletes' precompetition performance plans      while also considering participants' self-efficacy and mood characteristics.FAU - Arruza, Jose AntonioAU  - Arruza JAAD  - University of Pais Vasco.FAU - Telletxea, SaioaAU  - Telletxea SFAU - De Montes, Lorena GilAU  - De Montes LGFAU - Arribas, SilviaAU  - Arribas SFAU - Balague, GloriaAU  - Balague GFAU - Cecchini, Jose AntonioAU  - Cecchini JAFAU - Brustad, Robert JAU  - Brustad RJLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Percept Mot SkillsJT  - Perceptual and motor skillsJID - 0401131SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Athletic Performance/*psychologyMH  - CognitionMH  - *Competitive BehaviorMH  - *Decision MakingMH  - Depression/*psychologyMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Models, PsychologicalMH  - Personality InventoryMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Self ConceptMH  - *Self EfficacyMH  - Sports/*psychologyEDAT- 2009/10/17 06:00MHDA- 2009/12/16 06:00CRDT- 2009/10/17 06:00AID - 10.2466/PMS.109.1.304-314 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Percept Mot Skills. 2009 Aug;109(1):304-14.PMID- 19826289OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20091110DCOM- 20100225LR  - 20111117IS  - 1533-4287 (Electronic)IS  - 1064-8011 (Linking)VI  - 23IP  - 8DP  - 2009 NovTI  - Using basketball test battery to monitor players with mental retardation across 2      sports seasons.PG  - 2345-50LID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181bb7313 [doi]AB  - Although sport for athletes with mental retardation (MR) is achieving an      important role, literature concerning basketball test and training is still poor.      The aims of this study were to assess basketball ability before (PRE) and after      (POST) a 6-month training in athletes with MR across 2 sports seasons (ss) and to      analyze the variation of basketball abilities by subjects' MR level. Fifteen      trained basketball players with MR participated (11 men and 4 women; age range      19-43 years; MR: 3 Mild, 8 Moderate, 3 Severe, and 1 Profound). Athletes were      tested PRE and POST a 6-month training during 2 following sports seasons (ss1 and      ss2). The tests assessed 4 ability levels, each one characterized by the analysis      of 4 fundamental areas (ball handling, reception, passing, and shooting), divided      into 5 specific components. The athletes' global score improved after training in      both ss1 (41.5 +/- 12.0 vs. 48.6 +/- 15.4; p < 0.01) and ss2 (41.7 +/- 12.4 vs.      50.8 +/- 16.2; p < 0.01). Levels II, III, and IV showed an increase both after      each ss and the 2 following ss (p < 0.01). No significant difference was found      between POST-ss1 and POST-ss2 due to score decrease during the resting period      between the 2 ss. In both ss, global and level scores were negatively correlated       to MR level indicating that athletes with a lower MR obtained higher ability      scores. In conclusion, a 6-month training caused a general improvement,      especially evident in levels II and III in both ss. Global and level scores were       negatively correlated to MR level (p < 0.05) indicating that athletes with a      lower MR obtained higher scores. Therefore, the basketball test battery could be       useful for improving and monitoring training.FAU - Baldari, CarloAU  - Baldari CAD  - Department of Health Sciences, University IUSM of Rome Foro Italico, Rome, Italy.FAU - Franciosi, EmanueleAU  - Franciosi EFAU - Gallotta, Maria ChiaraAU  - Gallotta MCFAU - Emerenziani, Gian PietroAU  - Emerenziani GPFAU - Reis, Victor MachadoAU  - Reis VMFAU - Guidetti, LauraAU  - Guidetti LLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Strength Cond ResJT  - Journal of strength and conditioning research / National Strength & Conditioning       AssociationJID - 9415084SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Analysis of VarianceMH  - Athletic Performance/*physiology/psychologyMH  - Basketball/*physiology/psychologyMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - Intellectual Disability/*physiopathology/psychologyMH  - MaleMH  - Physical Education and Training/*methodsEDAT- 2009/10/15 06:00MHDA- 2010/02/26 06:00CRDT- 2009/10/15 06:00AID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181bb7313 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Strength Cond Res. 2009 Nov;23(8):2345-50. doi: 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181bb7313.PMID- 19804577OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20101118DCOM- 20110316IS  - 1600-0838 (Electronic)IS  - 0905-7188 (Linking)VI  - 20IP  - 5DP  - 2010 OctTI  - Psychometric properties of the Belgian coach version of the coach-athlete      relationship questionnaire (CART-Q).PG  - 779-86LID - 10.1111/j.1600-0838.2009.01020.x [doi]AB  - The study examined the psychometric properties of the Belgian coach version of      the Coach-Athlete Relationship Questionnaire (CART-Q). The questionnaire includes      three dimensions (Closeness, Commitment, and Complementarity) in a model that      intends to measure the quality of the coach-athlete relationship. Belgian coaches      (n=144) of athletes who performed at various competition levels in such sports as      football, basketball, and volleyball responded to the CART-Q and to the      Leadership Scale for Sport (LSS). A confirmatory factor analysis proved to be      slightly more satisfactory for a three-order factor model, compared with a      hierarchical first-order factor model. The three factors showed acceptable      internal consistency scores. Moreover, functional associations between the three       factors and coach leadership behaviors were found offering support to the      instrument's concurrent validity. The findings support previous validation      studies and verify the psychometric properties of the CART-Q applied to Belgian      coaches of team sports.CI  - (c) 2009 John Wiley & Sons A/S.FAU - Balduck, A-LAU  - Balduck ALAD  - Department of Movement and Sport Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.      anneline.balduck@UGent.BeFAU - Jowett, SAU  - Jowett SLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - DenmarkTA  - Scand J Med Sci SportsJT  - Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sportsJID - 9111504SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - BelgiumMH  - Chi-Square DistributionMH  - Factor Analysis, StatisticalMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - *Interpersonal RelationsMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Models, StatisticalMH  - PsychometricsMH  - *QuestionnairesMH  - Regression AnalysisMH  - Sports/*psychologyEDAT- 2009/10/07 06:00MHDA- 2011/03/17 06:00CRDT- 2009/10/07 06:00AID - SMS1020 [pii]AID - 10.1111/j.1600-0838.2009.01020.x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Scand J Med Sci Sports. 2010 Oct;20(5):779-86. doi:      10.1111/j.1600-0838.2009.01020.x.PMID- 22218235OWN - NLMSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINEDA  - 20120105DCOM- 20121002LR  - 20140620IS  - 1105-2333 (Print)IS  - 1105-2333 (Linking)VI  - 20IP  - 4DP  - 2009 OctTI  - Doping in sports.PG  - 336-41AB  - Regardless of one's stance on the topic, drugs are an important issue in sports.       Sports pages in newspapers around the globe routinely report on athletes at every      level ofcompetition using performance enhancing substances to gain an unfair      advantage over their competitors. The level of sophistication in beating drug      testing, and developing "next-generation" agents continues to raise. The relative      paucity of well designed research has been an additional factor impeding attempts      to adequately address the problem. Very limited funds are currently available to       conduct the necessary research. Without credible data, athletes are more      vulnerable to the claims made by those benefiting from the sales of these      compounds. Many younger fans and those dreaming of a similar future admire highly      successful professional athletes. A strong, consistent statement admonishing drug      use is needed. Actions speak louder than words. Every time a successful athlete      is caught using PE drugs, every effort to diminish drug use is negatively      impacted. The "win at all cost" and "second place is the first loser" mentality      needs to be continually challenged by words and actions in youth sports at every       level of competition. Finally, the war on drugs in sports needs to be a      coordinated, well organized international undertaking as sports play an important      role in virtually every culture. If we are to maintain the integrity of      competition and protect the health of the athletes, we must dramatically increase      our efforts to eliminate performance enhancing drugs as an acceptable option for       any athlete. Sports science professionals and sports psychiatrists need to work      with coaches, trainers, athletes, and national governing bodies to educating      athletes on the effects of performance enhancing drug use. To achieve this      important goal everyone involved in sports needs to be knowledgeable on the      negative impact this has on all aspects of organized sports. It is a difficult      challenge, but one that must be addressed.FAU - Baron, D AAU  - Baron DAAD  - Section of Exercise, Psychiatry and Sport, World Psychiatric Association.FAU - Foley, TAU  - Foley TLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - GreeceTA  - PsychiatrikiJT  - Psychiatrike = PsychiatrikiJID - 101534363EDAT- 2009/10/01 00:00MHDA- 2009/10/01 00:01CRDT- 2012/01/06 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - Psychiatriki. 2009 Oct;20(4):336-41.PMID- 19787540OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20100225DCOM- 20100721IS  - 1466-447X (Electronic)IS  - 0264-0414 (Linking)VI  - 27IP  - 13DP  - 2009 NovTI  - Understanding the coach's role in the development of mental toughness:      perspectives of elite Australian football coaches.PG  - 1483-96LID - 10.1080/02640410903150475 [doi]AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore elite coaches' perceptions of how they      can both facilitate and impede the development of key mental toughness      characteristics in the context of Australian football. Eleven coaches from a      previous study (Gucciardi, Gordon, & Dimmock, 2008) were re-interviewed and the      transcribed verbatim data were analysed using grounded theory data analytical      procedures (Strauss & Corbin, 1998). Five categories that appear to be central to      the coach's role in the development of mental toughness in Australian football      emerged. Four of these categories (coach-athlete relationship, coaching      philosophy, training environments, and specific strategies) were said to      facilitate the developmental process, whereas the final category (negative      experiences and influences) was said to impede this process. A grounded theory in      which the aforementioned categories enable coaches to nurture a "generalized      form" of mental toughness acquired during one's formative years into a      "sport-specific form" pertinent to Australian football is presented. The      theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.FAU - Gucciardi, Daniel FAU  - Gucciardi DFAD  - School of Sport Science, Exercise and Health, The University of Western      Australia, Perth, WA, Australia. daniel.gucciardi@graduate.uwa.edu.auFAU - Gordon, SandyAU  - Gordon SFAU - Dimmock, James AAU  - Dimmock JAFAU - Mallett, Clifford JAU  - Mallett CJLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - EnglandTA  - J Sports SciJT  - Journal of sports sciencesJID - 8405364SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - AthletesMH  - Athletic Performance/*psychologyMH  - AustraliaMH  - *Competitive BehaviorMH  - Football/education/*psychologyMH  - HumansMH  - Interpersonal RelationsMH  - Interviews as TopicMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Teaching/*methodsEDAT- 2009/09/30 06:00MHDA- 2010/07/22 06:00CRDT- 2009/09/30 06:00AID - 915326490 [pii]AID - 10.1080/02640410903150475 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Sci. 2009 Nov;27(13):1483-96. doi: 10.1080/02640410903150475.PMID- 19769412OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20090922DCOM- 20091106IS  - 0112-1642 (Print)IS  - 0112-1642 (Linking)VI  - 39IP  - 8DP  - 2009TI  - The evolution of sport psychiatry, circa 2009.PG  - 607-13LID - 10.2165/00007256-200939080-00001 [doi]AB  - Over the past three decades, the world of both amateur and professional sports      has expanded greatly and become more complex. In part related to these changes -       and relatively unknown to sports medicine practitioners - the field of sport      psychiatry has steadily evolved and grown. This paper focuses on what these      changes have been. A sport psychiatrist is a physician-psychiatrist who diagnoses      and treats problems, symptoms and/or disorders associated with an athlete, with      their family/significant others, with their team, or with their sport, including       spectators/fans. The primary aims of the specialty are to (i) optimize health,      (ii) improve athletic performance, and (iii) manage psychiatric symptoms or      disorders. The training includes medical training to provide knowledge and skills      unique to physicians; psychiatric training to provide knowledge and skills      inherent in that field, and training and/or experience in sport psychiatry to      provide knowledge and skills about psychiatric aspects of sports. The sport      psychiatrist first makes an individual, family-systems and phenomenological      diagnosis of the clinical situation. Based on this evaluation, he sets goals for       not only the athlete, but also for significant others involved. He delivers      treatment based on the psychiatric disorder or problem using a combination of      medication, psychotherapy or self-help group interventions plus strategies      targeted to specific sport performance issues. Evolution of the International      Society of Sport Psychiatry as well as the field, including incorporation into      school and professional team sports, is described along with a 'typical day' for       a sport psychiatrist.

This might result in      impaired motor skill or cognitive performance. Given the high cognitive demand of      putting and the potential fatiguing effects from prolonged walking, the      combination of a caffeine and carbohydrate drink could be beneficial in      offsetting hypoglycemia and hypohydration. This study used a laboratory-simulated      round of golf to examine the effect of an isotonic carbohydrate and caffeine      sports drink on putting performance during a round of golf. After institutional      ethics approval, 20 male golfers (mean +/- standard deviation: age 23 +/- 4      years, stature 176.4 +/- 5.6 cm, mass 72.8 +/- 17.4 kg, handicap 15 +/- 4, daily       caffeine consumption 157.3 +/- 47.2 mg) consumed either an isotonic sports drink       containing caffeine (6.4 g carbohydrate and 16 mg caffeine per 100 mL) or a      no-energy, flavour-matched placebo drink in a double-blind, randomized,      counter-balanced crossover design . Drinks were consumed preround (5 mL.kg-1 body      mass (BM)) and at holes 6 and 12 (2.5 mL.kg-1 BM). Participants therefore      consumed 1.6 mg.kg-1 BM of caffeine and 0.64 g.kg-1 BM of carbohydrate throughout      the trial. Five and 2 m putting performance were assessed at each hole.      Self-rated mood assessments were carried out every third hole. Putting      performance over 5 m and 2 m and self-rated scores for alertness and relaxation      showed a main effect for drink (p < 0.05). Ratings of mental fatigue and      tiredness significantly increased during the round (p < 0.001). In experienced      golfers, the consumption of an isotonic carbohydrate sports drink containing      caffeine prior to and during a round of golf improved putting performance and      increased feelings of alertness.FAU - Stevenson, Emma JAU  - Stevenson EJAD  - School of Psychology and Sports Sciences, Northumbria University, Newcastle upon       Tyne, NE1 8ST, UK. e.stevenson@northumbria.ac.ukFAU - Hayes, Philip RAU  - Hayes PRFAU - Allison, Sarah JAU  - Allison SJLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Randomized Controlled TrialPL  - CanadaTA  - Appl Physiol Nutr MetabJT  - Applied physiology, nutrition, and metabolism = Physiologie appliquee, nutrition       et metabolismeJID - 101264333RN  - 0 (Blood Glucose)RN  - 0 (Dietary Carbohydrates)RN  - 0 (Isotonic Solutions)RN  - 3G6A5W338E (Caffeine)SB  - IMMH  - Administration, OralMH  - AdultMH  - Affect/drug effectsMH  - Attention/drug effectsMH  - *BeveragesMH  - Blood Glucose/drug effectsMH  - Body Water/metabolismMH  - Caffeine/*administration & dosageMH  - Cognition/*drug effectsMH  - Cross-Over StudiesMH  - Dietary Carbohydrates/*administration & dosageMH  - Double-Blind MethodMH  - Fatigue/prevention & controlMH  - *GolfMH  - Heart Rate/drug effectsMH  - HumansMH  - Isotonic SolutionsMH  - MaleMH  - Motor Skills/*drug effectsMH  - Osmolar ConcentrationMH  - Oxygen Consumption/drug effectsMH  - Task Performance and AnalysisMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2009/09/22 06:00MHDA- 2009/10/16 06:00CRDT- 2009/09/22 06:00AID - h09-057 [pii]AID - 10.1139/H09-057 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Appl Physiol Nutr Metab. 2009 Aug;34(4):681-8. doi: 10.1139/H09-057.PMID- 19767270OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20090921DCOM- 20100127IS  - 0227-5910 (Print)IS  - 0227-5910 (Linking)VI  - 30IP  - 3DP  - 2009TI  - Can sports events affect suicidal behavior? A review of the literature and      implications for prevention.PG  - 144-52LID - 10.1027/0227-5910.30.3.144 [doi]AB  - BACKGROUND: Engagement in sports and physical activity, either actively as an      athlete or in a passive way as a spectator, impacts interpersonal behavior and      physical and mental health. AIMS: The study reviews literature on the      relationship between sports spectatorship and suicidal behavior to ascertain      whether sports spectatorship has an impact on suicidal behavior, either      increasing the risk or being a protective factor. METHODS: The literature was      searched via PubMed/MEDLINE and PsycINFO. Nine studies published between 1986 and      2006 were identified. RESULTS: The reviewed studies focused on the impact of      sports events on the societal level, and analyzed data regarding national or      local suicide rates. Their results indicate that sports events can have an impact      on suicide mortality and morbidity, but this relationship seems to be mediated by      age, gender, marital status, and alcohol consumption, as well as the process and       outcome of the game (e.g., victory vs. defeat of the favored team). CONCLUSIONS:       There is some evidence that sports events can reduce the rates of suicide on the       societal level; however, there is a lack of studies exploring how sports      spectatorship might influence levels of suicide risk in individuals and how      mediating variables might operate on the individual level.FAU - Andriessen, KarlAU  - Andriessen KAD  - Suicide Prevention Program of the Flemish Mental Health Centres FDGG-Zorgnet,      Gent, Belgium. karl.andriessen@pandora.beFAU - Krysinska, KarolinaAU  - Krysinska KLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - CanadaTA  - CrisisJT  - CrisisJID - 8218602SB  - IMMH  - Alcohol Drinking/adverse effects/psychologyMH  - Athletic PerformanceMH  - Cross-Sectional StudiesMH  - HumansMH  - ImaginationMH  - Imitative BehaviorMH  - Interpersonal RelationsMH  - Mass MediaMH  - *Motor ActivityMH  - RiskMH  - Social IdentificationMH  - Sports/*psychology/statistics & numerical dataMH  - Suicide, Attempted/prevention & control/*psychology/statistics & numerical dataRF  - 63EDAT- 2009/09/22 06:00MHDA- 2010/01/28 06:00CRDT- 2009/09/22 06:00AID - K770T40337663465 [pii]AID - 10.1027/0227-5910.30.3.144 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Crisis. 2009;30(3):144-52. doi: 10.1027/0227-5910.30.3.144.PMID- 19764000OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20100225DCOM- 20100531LR  - 20131121IS  - 1466-447X (Electronic)IS  - 0264-0414 (Linking)VI  - 27IP  - 12DP  - 2009 OctTI  - Ubiquitous computing in sports: A review and analysis.PG  - 1335-46LID - 10.1080/02640410903277427 [doi]AB  - Ubiquitous (pervasive) computing is a term for a synergetic use of sensing,      communication and computing. Pervasive use of computing has seen a rapid increase      in the current decade. This development has propagated in applied sport science      and everyday life. The work presents a survey of recent developments in sport and      leisure with emphasis on technology and computational techniques. A detailed      analysis on new technological developments is performed. Sensors for position and      motion detection, and such for equipment and physiological monitoring are      discussed. Aspects of novel trends in communication technologies and data      processing are outlined. Computational advancements have started a new trend -      development of smart and intelligent systems for a wide range of applications -      from model-based posture recognition to context awareness algorithms for      nutrition monitoring. Examples particular to coaching and training are discussed.      Selected tools for monitoring rules' compliance and automatic decision-making are      outlined. Finally, applications in leisure and entertainment are presented, from       systems supporting physical activity to systems providing motivation. It is      concluded that the emphasis in future will shift from technologies to intelligent      systems that allow for enhanced social interaction as efforts need to be made to       improve user-friendliness and standardisation of measurement and transmission      protocols.FAU - Baca, ArnoldAU  - Baca AAD  - Department of Biomechanics/Kinesiology and Applied Computer Science, University      of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. arnold.baca@univie.ac.atFAU - Dabnichki, PeterAU  - Dabnichki PFAU - Heller, MarioAU  - Heller MFAU - Kornfeind, PhilippAU  - Kornfeind PLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - EnglandTA  - J Sports SciJT  - Journal of sports sciencesJID - 8405364SB  - IMMH  - Biomechanical PhenomenaMH  - Computer SimulationMH  - *ComputersMH  - *Computing MethodologiesMH  - ExerciseMH  - HumansMH  - Leisure ActivitiesMH  - Monitoring, Ambulatory/instrumentationMH  - Monitoring, Physiologic/*instrumentationMH  - MovementMH  - Research/*instrumentationMH  - *SportsMH  - *Task Performance and AnalysisMH  - Time and Motion StudiesRF  - 63EDAT- 2009/09/19 06:00MHDA- 2010/06/01 06:00CRDT- 2009/09/19 06:00AID - 915047854 [pii]AID - 10.1080/02640410903277427 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Sci. 2009 Oct;27(12):1335-46. doi: 10.1080/02640410903277427.PMID- 19741353OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20090910DCOM- 20091201IS  - 1537-8918 (Electronic)IS  - 1537-890X (Linking)VI  - 8IP  - 5DP  - 2009 Sep-OctTI  - Injuries and medical issues in synchronized Olympic sports.PG  - 255-61LID - 10.1249/JSR.0b013e3181b84a09 [doi]AB  - Spectators of the Olympic Games can enjoy a wide variety of sports, including      strength, team, timed, endurance, and artistic sports. In the Olympic program,      there are two synchronized events: synchronized diving and synchronized swimming.      The precision of the synchronization of the athlete's movements and skills is an       added feature of entertainment. Synchronized athletes have additional training      requirements to perfect the synchronization of their skills. The physical demands      on the athlete from the repetition of training required for the perfection of      synchronization result in injuries unique to these sports. Although both      traumatic and overuse injuries occur, overuse injuries are more common. As these       disciplines are artistic, judged sports, these athletes also are susceptible to      eating disorders and the female athlete triad.

It is equally important to explore involvement of other       resources in society, such as sports associations. This study was designed to      investigate the possibility of reducing the degree of obesity in obese children      by focusing on physical activity as an intervention. METHODS: Seventy-six      children (40 boys) aged 8-12 years (mean age 10.5 years, mean body mass index      (BMI) 28.9, standard deviation (SD) 3.0; mean BMI z-score 3.24, SD 0.49) were      invited to participate in a one-week sports camp and six-month support system.      After the camp a sports coach from a local sports club supported the child during      participation in a chosen sport for six months. Weight, height, body composition       (using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry and magnetic resonance imaging), and      lifestyle (using a questionnaire) were measured at baseline and after 12 months.       Data were pooled from two camps, one with a self-selected control group and one      randomized controlled trial. RESULTS: Twelve months after the camp the      intervention group had a significant decrease in BMI z-score (baseline BMI      z-score 3.22; follow up 3.10, p = 0.023). The control group also reduced their      BMI z-score (baseline BMI z-score 3.27; follow up 3.18, p = 0.022). No      differences were found in baseline values, follow-up values, or changes in BMI      z-score between groups, nor between boys and girls.

The injured      athlete commonly receives care from several providers during rehabilitation. As      their condition improves, injured athletes resume strength and conditioning      programs and sport-specific activities in preparation for return to play. Until      full medical clearance is provided to return to sport and the athlete is      psychologically ready to return to play, the injured athlete remains a patient      regardless of who is developing and supervising each component of the recovery      process.

CONCLUSIONS: By using a standardized clinical      examination that is supported by objective measures of concussion-related      symptoms, mental status, and postural control, the medical professional becomes      well equipped to make an informed diagnosis.FAU - Broglio, Steven PAU  - Broglio SPAD  - University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.FAU - Guskiewicz, Kevin MAU  - Guskiewicz KMLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Sports HealthJT  - Sports healthJID - 101518422PMC - PMC3445181OID - NLM: PMC3445181OTO - NOTNLMOT  - mild traumatic brain injuryOT  - neurocognitive statusOT  - postural controlOT  - symptomsEDAT- 2009/09/01 00:00MHDA- 2009/09/01 00:01CRDT- 2012/09/28 06:00AID - 10.1177/1941738109343158 [doi]AID - 10.1177_1941738109343158 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Sports Health. 2009 Sep;1(5):361-9.PMID- 19686705OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20100611DCOM- 20110125IS  - 1872-6240 (Electronic)IS  - 0006-8993 (Linking)VI  - 1341DP  - 2010 Jun 23TI  - Sport expert's motor imagery: functional imaging of professional motor skills and      simple motor skills.PG  - 52-62LID - 10.1016/j.brainres.2009.08.014 [doi]AB  - Numerous studies provide evidence that motor skill acquisition is associated with      dynamic changes in cortical and subcortical regions. Athletes are a professional       population who are engaged in extensive motor training for long periods. However,      the neural substrates of extreme level motor performance have not been clarified.      We used kinesthetic imagery task to induce the mental representation of sport      expert's extraordinary performance in view of the shared substrates of executing       movement and motor imagery. For the first time, we compared, through functional      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the pattern of cerebral activations in 12      professional divers and 12 normal people without extensive training, during      imagery of professional skills and imagery of simple motor skills. The sport      experts showed significant activation in the parahippocampus during imagery of      professional skills relative to the novices, which might reflect the      representation adapted to experience-related motor tasks. No significant      difference was found between experts and novices when they imagined simple motor       skills. These results indicated the experts might utilize their kinesthetic      imagery more efficiently than novices, but only for the activity in which they      had expertise. The sport experts also demonstrated more focused activation      patterns in prefrontal areas in both of imagery tasks, which may be relevant to      higher order of motor control during motor imagery. Moreover, this study      suggested that the brains of sport experts could be regarded as the ideal      subjects to explore the relationship between cerebral plasticity and learning of       complex motor skills.CI  - Copyright 2009 Elsevier B.V.

To gain a clearer picture of      amenorrhea/oligomenorrhea in Iran, one of the main components of the female      athlete triad, we therefore established this study on the prevalence of      amenorrhea/oligomenorrhea in elite Iranian female athletes, also evaluating the      risk factors of these disorders in the same population. METHODS: This study      performed as a cross-sectional study. All elite Iranian female athletes of 34      sports federation, including female athletes in national teams and medalists of      Tehran were invited to participate. A total of 788 (95% response rate) returned      the questionnaires and were examined. Younger athletes under the age of menarche       were excluded. Each athlete completed a self-administered questionnaire, which      covered the following questions about participant's demographic information,      athletic history, history of injuries and menstrual pattern. In order to diagnose      the causes of amenorrhea/Oligomenorrhea including polycystic ovary      syndrome(PCOS), participants with amenorrhea/Oligomenorrhea underwent further      investigation. They were evaluated by following Para clinic investigation, and an      ultrasonographic study of ovary. RESULTS: The age ranged from 13-37 (mean = 21.1,      SD = 4.5). Seventy one (9.0%) individuals had amenorrhea/oligomenorrhea, among      those, 11 (15.5%) had PCOS.There was also a positive association between      amenorrhea/oligomenorrhea and the following: age under 20 OR; 2.67, 95%CI(1.47 -       4.85), weight class sports OR; 2.09, 95%CI(1.15 - 3.82), endurance sports OR;      2.89, 95%CI(1.22 - 6.84), late onset of menarche OR; 3.32 95%CI(1.04-10.51), and       use of oral contraceptive pills OR; 6.17, 95%CI(3.00 - 12.69). Intensity of      training sport or BMI were not risk factors. CONCLUSION: These findings support      the previous findings in the literature that the prevalence of      amenorrhea/oligomenorrhea is high in athletes. Furthermore, we provided the first      report on the prevalence of PCOS in female athletes with      amenorrhea/oligomenorrhea. Athletes would be greatly benefited by greater general      awareness about the complications of amenorrhea/oligomenorrhea.To increase      awareness of exercise-associated menstrual cycle irregularities, it is necessary       to design complete and comprehensive education programs for female athletes,      their parents, their coaches, and the relevant authorities.FAU - Dadgostar, HalehAU  - Dadgostar HAD  - Sport Medicine Department of Iran Medical University, Rassole Akram Hospital,,      Iran University, Tehran, Iran. hldadgostar@gmail.com.FAU - Razi, MohammadAU  - Razi MFAU - Aleyasin, AshrafAU  - Aleyasin AFAU - Alenabi, TaliaAU  - Alenabi TFAU - Dahaghin, SaeidehAU  - Dahaghin SLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20090730PL  - EnglandTA  - Sports Med Arthrosc Rehabil Ther TechnolJT  - Sports medicine, arthroscopy, rehabilitation, therapy & technology : SMARTTJID - 101484554PMC - PMC2732598OID - NLM: PMC2732598EDAT- 2009/08/01 09:00MHDA- 2009/08/01 09:01CRDT- 2009/08/01 09:00PHST- 2009/03/08 [received]PHST- 2009/07/30 [accepted]PHST- 2009/07/30 [aheadofprint]AID - 1758-2555-1-16 [pii]AID - 10.1186/1758-2555-1-16 [doi]PST - epublishSO  - Sports Med Arthrosc Rehabil Ther Technol. 2009 Jul 30;1(1):16. doi:      10.1186/1758-2555-1-16.PMID- 19598050OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20090714DCOM- 20091005IS  - 1540-3548 (Electronic)IS  - 1089-4160 (Linking)VI  - 13IP  - 3DP  - 2009TI  - Queering lesbian sexualities in collegiate sporting spaces.PG  - 306-18LID - 10.1080/10894160902876804 [doi]AB  - This article utilizes cultural studies praxis, queer theory, and feminist      poststructuralism to explore the ways in which eight collegiate-level coaches who      self-identify with non-normative sexualities transgress heteronormative      boundaries by being "out" or visible in sporting spaces. Data were collected      through semi-structured qualitative interviews and analyzed within a      queer-feminist hybrid framework (Sykes, 1998). I found that compulsory      heterosexuality continually worked to silence female coaches with non-normative      sexualities despite their efforts to change heterosexist sport cultures. Many of       these women engaged in necessary practical strategies for historically silenced      groups (Sedgewick, 1990) to create change, such as changing language in athletic       department policy, and using a politics of difference to challenge the status quo      on several fronts (e.g., gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality). However, in spite      of conscientious efforts to do otherwise, poststructuralist and queer      deconstructions of the transcripts illustrated how forced norms and discursive      practices inherent in sport regulated both silence and speech for many of the      interviewees.FAU - Kauer, Kerrie JAU  - Kauer KJAD  - Department of Kinesiology, California State University, Long Beach, 1250      Bellflower Boulevard, Long Beach, CA 90840-8306, USA. kkauer@csulb.eduLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Lesbian StudJT  - Journal of lesbian studiesJID - 9891002SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Competitive BehaviorMH  - Conflict (Psychology)MH  - FemaleMH  - Homosexuality, Female/*psychologyMH  - HumansMH  - *Interpersonal RelationsMH  - Peer GroupMH  - *PrejudiceMH  - Social EnvironmentMH  - Social PerceptionMH  - Sports/*psychologyMH  - Students/psychologyMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2009/07/15 09:00MHDA- 2009/10/06 06:00CRDT- 2009/07/15 09:00AID - 913112430 [pii]AID - 10.1080/10894160902876804 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Lesbian Stud. 2009;13(3):306-18. doi: 10.1080/10894160902876804.PMID- 19595702OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20091023DCOM- 20110104IS  - 1096-0260 (Electronic)IS  - 0091-7435 (Linking)VI  - 49IP  - 4DP  - 2009 OctTI  - "Live, Learn and Play": building strategic alliances between professional sports       and public health.PG  - 322-5LID - 10.1016/j.ypmed.2009.06.029 [doi]AB  - Public-private partnerships allow communities and corporate entities to pool      resources to address a mission of relevance to their common constituency or      consumer base. Collaborations between public health and professional sports may      present unique opportunities to improve health outcomes related to physical      activity since athletes are fitness icons, both for adults and children. There      are many "win-win" opportunities, as sports venues regularly host huge numbers of      spectators, offering food and entertainment, providing hours of exposure, and      introducing new ideas for engaging fans in order to remain a competitive draw. In      2008, the San Diego Padres embarked on a communitywide fitness initiative,      FriarFit, including incorporating 10-minute Instant Recess breaks during their      Sunday homestand pre-game shows. Many lessons have been learned that may be      useful to others mounting such initiatives, such as: there is more at stake in      cost-benefit and risk-benefit assessment for sports executives, requiring greater      caution and circumspection than is typical for public health projects; the core      business of the corporate entity must be accommodated without undermining the      health objectives; and health aims must be addressed in a way that is financially      viable and delivers tangible value for profit-making concerns, in terms of      marketing, revenues or brand enhancement.FAU - Yancey, AntronetteAU  - Yancey AAD  - Department of Health Services, Division of Cancer Prevention and Control      Research, UCLA School of Public Health, Los Angeles, California, USA.      aYancey@ucla.eduFAU - Winfield, DavidAU  - Winfield DFAU - Larsen, JudiAU  - Larsen JFAU - Anderson, MicheleAU  - Anderson MFAU - Jackson, PortiaAU  - Jackson PFAU - Overton, JeffAU  - Overton JFAU - Wilson, ShawnAU  - Wilson SFAU - Rossum, AllenAU  - Rossum AFAU - Kumanyika, ShirikiAU  - Kumanyika SLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20090709PL  - United StatesTA  - Prev MedJT  - Preventive medicineJID - 0322116SB  - IMMH  - African Americans/statistics & numerical dataMH  - *AthletesMH  - Evidence-Based PracticeMH  - *ExerciseMH  - Hispanic Americans/statistics & numerical dataMH  - HumansMH  - Motor ActivityMH  - Professional RoleMH  - Program DevelopmentMH  - Program EvaluationMH  - *Public HealthMH  - *Public-Private Sector PartnershipsMH  - *Social MarketingMH  - *SportsMH  - United StatesEDAT- 2009/07/15 09:00MHDA- 2011/01/05 06:00CRDT- 2009/07/15 09:00PHST- 2009/02/03 [received]PHST- 2009/06/08 [revised]PHST- 2009/06/30 [accepted]PHST- 2009/07/09 [aheadofprint]AID - S0091-7435(09)00333-8 [pii]AID - 10.1016/j.ypmed.2009.06.029 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Prev Med. 2009 Oct;49(4):322-5. doi: 10.1016/j.ypmed.2009.06.029.

DESIGN: Longitudinal study. SETTING:      School- and telephone-based surveys in New Hampshire and Vermont between      September 1999 through November 1999 and February 2006 through February 2007.      PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2048 youths aged 16 to 21 years at follow-up. Main      Exposures Baseline movie smoking exposure categorized in quartiles assessed when       respondents were aged 9 to 14 years and team sports participation assessed when      respondents were aged 16 to 21 years. Main Outcome Measure Established smoking      (having smoked > or =100 cigarettes in one's lifetime) at follow-up. RESULTS: At       follow-up, 353 respondents (17.2%) were established smokers. Exposure to the      highest quartile of movie smoking compared with the lowest increased the      likelihood of established smoking (odds ratio = 1.63; 95% confidence interval,      1.03-2.57), and team sports nonparticipants compared with participants were twice      as likely to be established smokers (odds ratio = 2.01; 95% confidence interval,       1.47-2.74). The joint effects of movie smoking exposure and team sports      participation revealed that at each quartile of movie smoking exposure, the odds       of established smoking were greater for team sports nonparticipants than for      participants. We saw a dose-response relationship of movie smoking exposure for      established smoking only among team sports participants. CONCLUSIONS: Team sports      participation clearly plays a protective role against established smoking, even      in the face of exposure to movie smoking. However, movie smoking exposure      increases the risk of established smoking among both team sports participants and      nonparticipants. Parents, teachers, coaches, and clinicians should be aware that       encouraging team sports participation in tandem with minimizing early exposure to      movie smoking may offer the greatest likelihood of preventing youth smoking.FAU - Adachi-Mejia, Anna MAU  - Adachi-Mejia AMAD  - Community Health Research Program, Hood Center for Children and Families,      Dartmouth Medical School, One Medical Center Drive, Lebanon, NH 03756-0001, USA.       anna.adachi-mejia@dartmouth.eduFAU - Primack, Brian AAU  - Primack BAFAU - Beach, Michael LAU  - Beach MLFAU - Titus-Ernstoff, LindaAU  - Titus-Ernstoff LFAU - Longacre, Meghan RAU  - Longacre MRFAU - Weiss, Julia EAU  - Weiss JEFAU - Dalton, Madeline AAU  - Dalton MALA  - engGR  - CA 108918/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - CA 77026/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - K07 CA114315/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - K07 CA114315-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 CA077026/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 CA108918/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralPL  - United StatesTA  - Arch Pediatr Adolesc MedJT  - Archives of pediatrics & adolescent medicineJID - 9422751SB  - AIMSB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Adolescent BehaviorMH  - ChildMH  - Effect Modifier, EpidemiologicMH  - Health BehaviorMH  - HumansMH  - Imitative BehaviorMH  - Longitudinal StudiesMH  - *Motion Pictures as TopicMH  - Multivariate AnalysisMH  - New Hampshire/epidemiologyMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Smoking/*epidemiology/*psychologyMH  - Social ConformityMH  - *SportsMH  - Vermont/epidemiologyMH  - Young AdultPMC - PMC3006430MID - NIHMS256345OID - NLM: NIHMS256345OID - NLM: PMC3006430EDAT- 2009/07/08 09:00MHDA- 2009/08/06 09:00CRDT- 2009/07/08 09:00AID - 163/7/638 [pii]AID - 10.1001/archpediatrics.2009.59 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med. 2009 Jul;163(7):638-43. doi:      10.1001/archpediatrics.2009.59.PMID- 19530752OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20090617DCOM- 20090902LR  - 20131121IS  - 0112-1642 (Print)IS  - 0112-1642 (Linking)VI  - 39IP  - 7DP  - 2009TI  - Shoulder muscle recruitment patterns and related biomechanics during upper      extremity sports.PG  - 569-90LID - 10.2165/00007256-200939070-00004 [doi]AB  - Understanding when and how much shoulder muscles are active during upper      extremity sports is helpful to physicians, therapists, trainers and coaches in      providing appropriate treatment, training and rehabilitation protocols to these      athletes. This review focuses on shoulder muscle activity (rotator cuff,      deltoids, pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, triceps and biceps brachii, and      scapular muscles) during the baseball pitch, the American football throw, the      windmill softball pitch, the volleyball serve and spike, the tennis serve and      volley, baseball hitting, and the golf swing. Because shoulder electromyography      (EMG) data are far more extensive for overhead throwing activities compared with       non-throwing upper extremity sports, much of this review focuses on shoulder EMG       during the overhead throwing motion. Throughout this review shoulder kinematic      and kinetic data (when available) are integrated with shoulder EMG data to help      better understand why certain muscles are active during different phases of an      activity, what type of muscle action (eccentric or concentric) occurs, and to      provide insight into the shoulder injury mechanism. Kinematic, kinetic and EMG      data have been reported extensively during overhead throwing, such as baseball      pitching and football passing. Because shoulder forces, torques and muscle      activity are generally greatest during the arm cocking and arm deceleration      phases of overhead throwing, it is believed that most shoulder injuries occur      during these phases. During overhead throwing, high rotator cuff muscle activity       is generated to help resist the high shoulder distractive forces approximately      80-120% bodyweight during the arm cocking and deceleration phases. During arm      cocking, peak rotator cuff activity is 49-99% of a maximum voluntary isometric      contraction (MVIC) in baseball pitching and 41-67% MVIC in football throwing.      During arm deceleration, peak rotator cuff activity is 37-84% MVIC in baseball      pitching and 86-95% MVIC in football throwing. Peak rotator cuff activity is also      high is the windmill softball pitch (75-93% MVIC), the volleyball serve and spike      (54-71% MVIC), the tennis serve and volley (40-113% MVIC), baseball hitting      (28-39% MVIC), and the golf swing (28-68% MVIC). Peak scapular muscle activity is      also high during the arm cocking and arm deceleration phases of baseball      pitching, with peak serratus anterior activity 69-106% MVIC, peak upper, middle      and lower trapezius activity 51-78% MVIC, peak rhomboids activity 41-45% MVIC,      and peak levator scapulae activity 33-72% MVIC.

Participants included 476 (male = 275, female = 201) National Collegiate Athletic      Association Division I collegiate football, soccer, and volleyball athletes; the       men were from football programs and the women were from soccer and volleyball      programs. The Attitudes of Athletes toward Male versus Female Coaches      Questionnaire was used to assess the attitudes and feelings of male and female      athletes toward the gender of their strength coach (29). The results of a 2 x 2      multivariate analysis of variance (athlete gender x coach gender) revealed that      the male athletes (all football players) were less comfortable with a female      strength coach in all regards and preferred to have a male strength coach (p <      0.05). Female athletes did not have a gender preference, nor did they have any      negative attitudes toward a strength coach. The women would be productive      training with any qualified strength coach, whereas the men would prefer working       with a male strength coach no matter how qualified the female coach might be. As       a result of this study, one suggestion is for male athletes to be exposed to      female strength coaches much earlier in their sport experience. This might help      reduce gender bias later in their athletic careers.FAU - Magnusen, Marshall JAU  - Magnusen MJAD  - Department of Sport Management, Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida,      USA. mjm07n@fsu.eduFAU - Rhea, Deborah JAU  - Rhea DJLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Strength Cond ResJT  - Journal of strength and conditioning research / National Strength & Conditioning       AssociationJID - 9415084SB  - IMMH  - Analysis of VarianceMH  - *AttitudeMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Physical Education and Training/*manpowerMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Sex FactorsMH  - *SportsMH  - UniversitiesEDAT- 2009/06/17 09:00MHDA- 2009/10/23 06:00CRDT- 2009/06/17 09:00AID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e318199d8c4 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Strength Cond Res. 2009 Jul;23(4):1084-90. doi: 10.1519/JSC.0b013e318199d8c4.PMID- 19476227OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20090529DCOM- 20090619IS  - 1138-7416 (Print)IS  - 1138-7416 (Linking)VI  - 12IP  - 1DP  - 2009 MayTI  - Coach autonomy support and quality of sport engagement in young soccer players.PG  - 138-48AB  - Based on the self-determination theory (Ryan & Deci, 2000), this study tested a      model of the assumed sequential relationships between perceived autonomy support,      psychological need satisfaction, self-determined motivation, and      enjoyment/boredom. The hypothesized mediational roles of psychological need      satisfaction and self-determined motivation were also studied. In a sample of 370      young male soccer players, path analysis results offered support for the proposed      model. Total mediation was supported in the case of the psychological need      satisfaction in the relationship between autonomy support and self-determined      motivation, and partial mediation for self-determined motivation in the links      between psychological need satisfaction and enjoyment (positive) and boredom      (negative).

STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive cohort study.      SETTING: University of Calgary. SUBJECTS: 260 male and female university      football, ice hockey and wrestling athletes over three seasons (2005-7). METHODS:      A baseline SCAT was completed during preseason medical evaluation. Subjects were       grouped as follows: all participants, men, women, never concussed (NC) and      previously concussed (PC). MAIN RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 20.5      years (range 17-32). In total, 41.2% of all athletes had a total post-concussion       symptom scale (PCSS) score of 0. The mean baseline PCSS scores were as follows:      all participants 4.29; men 3.52; women 6.39; NC 3.75 and PC 5.25. The five most      frequently reported symptoms for all athletes were fatigue/low energy (37% of      subjects), drowsiness (23%), neck pain (20%), difficulty concentrating (18%) and       difficulty remembering (18%). The median immediate recall score was 5/5 for all      groups. Women scored a median of 5/5 on delayed recall, whereas all remaining      groups scored a median of 4/5. Months in reverse order were successfully      completed by 91.6% of subjects. All participants, women and PC scored a median of      6 on reverse digits, whereas men and NC scored a median of 5. CONCLUSIONS: The      mean SCAT baseline PCSS score was approximately 5, although just under half of      the athletes scored 0. Female athletes scored better on tests of neurocognitive      function. PC athletes scored better than NC athletes on all neurocognitive tests       except delayed five-word recall.FAU - Shehata, NAU  - Shehata NAD  - University of Calgary Sport Medicine Centre, 2500 University Drive NW, Calgary,      Alberta T2N 1N4, Canada.FAU - Wiley, J PAU  - Wiley JPFAU - Richea, SAU  - Richea SFAU - Benson, B WAU  - Benson BWFAU - Duits, LAU  - Duits LFAU - Meeuwisse, W HAU  - Meeuwisse WHLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20090520PL  - EnglandTA  - Br J Sports MedJT  - British journal of sports medicineJID - 0432520SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - Anxiety/etiologyMH  - AttentionMH  - Brain Concussion/*diagnosis/psychologyMH  - Cohort StudiesMH  - Fatigue/etiologyMH  - FemaleMH  - Football/*injuries/psychologyMH  - Headache/etiologyMH  - Hockey/*injuries/psychologyMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Mental RecallMH  - Neck Pain/etiologyMH  - Sleep StagesMH  - *Trauma Severity IndicesMH  - Wrestling/*injuries/psychologyMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2009/05/23 09:00MHDA- 2010/11/03 06:00CRDT- 2009/05/23 09:00PHST- 2009/05/20 [aheadofprint]AID - bjsm.2009.059832 [pii]AID - 10.1136/bjsm.2009.059832 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Br J Sports Med. 2009 Oct;43(10):730-4. doi: 10.1136/bjsm.2009.059832.

The role that specialists with a background       in skill acquisition can play is illustrated and the need to move towards a      culture where evidence-based practice permeates all aspects of this process      reiterated. We provide examples from contemporary research to illustrate how      skill-acquisition theory and practice can help inform and guide practitioners,      coaches, and administrators in their quest to develop Olympic athletes. Although       the acquisition and refinement of skills are essential to performance in most      Olympic sports, paradoxically the area of skill acquisition has not impacted in a      concerted and meaningful way on this agenda. Skill-acquisition specialists need      to be more proactive in forging links with elite sport, whereas practitioners,      coaches, and administrators need to appreciate the important role that sports      scientists with a background in this area can play in helping to develop future      generations of podium athletes.FAU - Williams, A MarkAU  - Williams AMAD  - Research Institute for Sport and Exercise Sciences, Liverpool John Moores      University, Liverpool L3 2ET, UK. m.williams@livjm.ac.ukFAU - Ford, Paul RAU  - Ford PRLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - EnglandTA  - J Sports SciJT  - Journal of sports sciencesJID - 8405364SB  - IMMH  - *AthletesMH  - *Athletic PerformanceMH  - HumansMH  - *LearningMH  - *Motor SkillsMH  - Sports/*educationMH  - Task Performance and AnalysisMH  - Teaching/methodsEDAT- 2009/05/19 09:00MHDA- 2010/07/22 06:00CRDT- 2009/05/19 09:00AID - 911222335 [pii]AID - 10.1080/02640410902874737 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Sci. 2009 Nov;27(13):1381-92. doi: 10.1080/02640410902874737.PMID- 19437187OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20090521DCOM- 20090825IS  - 0264-0414 (Print)IS  - 0264-0414 (Linking)VI  - 27IP  - 7DP  - 2009 MayTI  - Influence of order effects and mode of judgement on assessments of ability in      sport.PG  - 745-52LID - 10.1080/02640410902939647 [doi]AB  - We examined the influence of order effects on assessments of sporting ability.      Club-standard ultimate frisbee players (n = 240) viewed footage of a target      player performing a series of ultimate frisbee skills. Participants viewed either      a declining (successful to unsuccessful) pattern of performance or an ascending      (unsuccessful to successful) pattern. Ratings were made on three descriptors of      ultimate frisbee ability. One group of participants made ratings at the end of      the sequence of clips, one group updated their ratings after each clip in a      step-by-step manner, and one group used an extended step-by-step processing      strategy. Finally, a fourth group made end-of-sequence ratings, but a delay      condition was used to control for the time taken to make step-by-step ratings.      Analyses of covariance (order vs. judgement condition) were conducted on the      ratings. Results revealed primacy effects for the ratings of the target player in      the end-of-sequence and delay conditions, and in the first step-by-step      condition, but no order effects in the second step-by-step condition. Findings      indicate order effects can be reduced by using a more thorough step-by-step      processing strategy.FAU - Smith, Matthew JAU  - Smith MJAD  - School of Sport, Health and Exercise Sciences, University of Chichester,      Chichester, UK. matt.smith@chi.ac.ukFAU - Greenlees, IainAU  - Greenlees IFAU - Manley, AndrewAU  - Manley ALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - EnglandTA  - J Sports SciJT  - Journal of sports sciencesJID - 8405364SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - Athletic Performance/*psychologyMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - *Mental ProcessesMH  - Models, PsychologicalMH  - Perceptual MaskingMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2009/05/14 09:00MHDA- 2009/08/26 09:00CRDT- 2009/05/14 09:00AID - 911110981 [pii]AID - 10.1080/02640410902939647 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Sci. 2009 May;27(7):745-52. doi: 10.1080/02640410902939647.PMID- 19433428OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20090512DCOM- 20100621IS  - 1473-0480 (Electronic)IS  - 0306-3674 (Linking)VI  - 43 Suppl 1DP  - 2009 MayTI  - Knowledge transfer principles as applied to sport concussion education.PG  - i68-75LID - 10.1136/bjsm.2009.058180 [doi]AB  - OBJECTIVE: To (a) examine knowledge transfer literature and optimal learning      needs as applied to healthcare professionals, coaches and student athletes; (b)      apply the practice of knowledge transfer to sport concussion education resources;      and (c) identify needs and make recommendations for optimising concussion      education. DESIGN: Qualitative literature review of knowledge transfer and      concussion education literature. INTERVENTION: Pubmed, Medline, Psych Info and      Sport Discus databases were reviewed. 52 journal articles, 20 websites and 2      books were reviewed. RESULTS: The methods in which individuals experience optimal      learning varies and should be considered when developing effective concussion      education strategies. Physician knowledge and performance are impacted by      education outreach, interaction and reminder messages. Educational strategies      associated with optimal learning for physio and athletic therapists include      problem and evidence-based practice, socialisation and peer-assisted learning.      From a coaching perspective, research supports the reflective process as a      learning modality. Student athletes have strengths and weaknesses in different      areas and so perform differently on activities requiring distinct strategies.      Knowing the impact of sport concussion resources on knowledge enhancement and      modifying attitudes and behaviours toward concussion requires evaluation      strategies. Review of concussion resources using the perspective of knowledge      transfer and methods for improvement is discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge      transfer is a relatively new concept in sports medicine and its influence on      enhancing concussion education is not well known. The needs and optimal learning       styles of target audiences coupled with evaluation need to be a piece of the      overall concussion education puzzle to effectively impact knowledge of and      attitudes and behaviours towards sport concussion.FAU - Provvidenza, C FAU  - Provvidenza CFAD  - Cancer Care Ontario, Ontario, Canada.FAU - Johnston, K MAU  - Johnston KMLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - EnglandTA  - Br J Sports MedJT  - British journal of sports medicineJID - 0432520SB  - IMMH  - Allied Health Personnel/educationMH  - *Athletic InjuriesMH  - *Brain ConcussionMH  - Clinical Competence/standardsMH  - CommunicationMH  - Education, Medical, Continuing/*methodsMH  - HumansMH  - Interprofessional RelationsMH  - Patient Care TeamMH  - Sports Medicine/*educationMH  - Teaching/methodsMH  - Teaching MaterialsRF  - 53EDAT- 2009/05/14 09:00MHDA- 2010/06/22 06:00CRDT- 2009/05/13 09:00AID - 43/Suppl_1/i68 [pii]AID - 10.1136/bjsm.2009.058180 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Br J Sports Med. 2009 May;43 Suppl 1:i68-75. doi: 10.1136/bjsm.2009.058180.PMID- 19387405OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20090506DCOM- 20090805IS  - 1533-4287 (Electronic)IS  - 1064-8011 (Linking)VI  - 23IP  - 3DP  - 2009 MayTI  - Maximal anaerobic power test in athletes of different sport disciplines.PG  - 751-5LID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181a07a9a [doi]AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the values of anaerobic energetic      capacity variables in athletes engaged in different sport disciplines and to      compare them in relation to specific demands of each sport. Wingate anaerobic      tests were conducted on 145 elite athletes (14 boxers, 17 wrestlers, 27 hockey      players, 23 volleyball players, 20 handball players, 25 basketball players, and      19 soccer players). Three variables were measured as markers of anaerobic      capacity: peak power, mean power, and explosive power. The highest values of peak      power were measured in volleyball 11.71 +/- 1.56 W.kg and basketball players      10.69 +/- 1.67 W.kg, and the difference was significant compared with the other      athletes (p <or= 0.05). The lowest value of peak power (8.58 +/- 1.56 W.kg) was      registered in handball players. The mean power variable showed a similar      distribution as peak power among groups. The highest values of explosive power      were also registered in volleyball 1.75 +/- 0.33 W.s.kg and basketball players      1.64 +/- 0.35 W.s.kg, but there was no significant difference in values between      volleyball players and wrestlers, between boxers and wrestlers, between boxers      and basketball players, and between volleyball and hockey players (p > 0.05). The      measured results show the influence of anaerobic capacity in different sports and      the referral values of these variables for the elite male athletes. Explosive      power presented a new dimension of anaerobic power, i.e., how fast maximal energy      for power development can be obtained, and its values are high in all sports      activities that demand explosiveness and fast maximal energy production. Coaches       or other experts in the field could, in the future, find useful to follow and      improve, through training process, one of the variables that is most informative       for that sport.FAU - Popadic Gacesa, Jelena ZAU  - Popadic Gacesa JZAD  - Department of Physiology, Medical School, University of Novi Sad, Serbia.      jpopadic@uns.ns.ac.yuFAU - Barak, Otto FAU  - Barak OFFAU - Grujic, Nikola GAU  - Grujic NGLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - United StatesTA  - J Strength Cond ResJT  - Journal of strength and conditioning research / National Strength & Conditioning       AssociationJID - 9415084SB  - IMMH  - *Anaerobic ThresholdMH  - Analysis of VarianceMH  - AnthropometryMH  - Energy MetabolismMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Prospective StudiesMH  - Sports/*physiologyMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2009/04/24 09:00MHDA- 2009/08/06 09:00CRDT- 2009/04/24 09:00AID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181a07a9a [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Strength Cond Res. 2009 May;23(3):751-5. doi: 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181a07a9a.PMID- 19372597OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20101102DCOM- 20111122IS  - 1473-0480 (Electronic)IS  - 0306-3674 (Linking)VI  - 44IP  - 14DP  - 2010 NovTI  - The role of the faculty of sports and exercise medicine for public health and      elite athlete care.PG  - 998-1001LID - 10.1136/bjsm.2009.060145 [doi]FAU - Noakes, Timothy DAU  - Noakes TDAD  - Department of Human Biology, University of Cape Town, Sports Science of South      Africa, PO Box 115, Newlands 7725, South Africa. timothy.noakes@uct.ac.zaLA  - engPT  - LecturesDEP - 20090416PL  - EnglandTA  - Br J Sports MedJT  - British journal of sports medicineJID - 0432520SB  - IMMH  - Attitude to HealthMH  - CommerceMH  - *ExerciseMH  - Faculty, MedicalMH  - Health PromotionMH  - HumansMH  - Mental ProcessesMH  - Public HealthMH  - *Societies, MedicalMH  - SportsMH  - *Sports MedicineEDAT- 2009/04/18 09:00MHDA- 2011/12/13 00:00CRDT- 2009/04/18 09:00PHST- 2009/04/16 [aheadofprint]PHST- 2010/05/19 [aheadofprint]AID - bjsm.2009.060145 [pii]AID - 10.1136/bjsm.2009.060145 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Br J Sports Med. 2010 Nov;44(14):998-1001. doi: 10.1136/bjsm.2009.060145.

METHODS: A      questionnaire was applied to 30 brasilians hang-gliding and paragliding      apprentices in order to identify aspects such as, physical activity, preventive      behavior, nutrition, stress control and social relationships. RESULTS: Comparing       results with the ones found in other adventure sports, it was observed that      flyers adopt a competitive and risky behavior, not showing good results in      relation to affectionate relationships and physical exercises. On the other hand,      all of them are considered as wealthy and more used to dealing with stress. Even       not possessing good physical conditioning, individuals practice flight just due      to their technical knowledge and the dominium of technology Thus, apprentices use      those sport tensions as a form of training the stress control in risky      situations. CONCLUSIONS: Regarding mental health, activities of active leisure      are highly recommended as an escape valve to stress. The group studied showed      that besides increasing the tolerance to stress, generated by risky situations,      individuals went beyond, once it was observed that the risks of such sport have      turned the individuals into more and more insensitive to the professional life      pressure.FAU - Pimentel, Giuliano Gomes de AssisAU  - Pimentel GGAD  - Centro de Ciencias da Saude da Universidade Estadual de Maringa, Brasil.      ggapimentel@uem.brLA  - porPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - English AbstractPT  - Evaluation StudiesPT  - Journal ArticleTT  - Aspectos socioculturais na percepcao da qualidade de vida entre praticantes de      esportes de aventura.PL  - ColombiaTA  - Rev Salud Publica (Bogota)JT  - Revista de salud publica (Bogota, Colombia)JID - 100936348SB  - IMMH  - BrazilMH  - Cultural CharacteristicsMH  - HumansMH  - *Quality of LifeMH  - *Risk-TakingMH  - Socioeconomic FactorsMH  - *Sports/psychologyMH  - *Stress, PsychologicalEDAT- 2009/04/11 09:00MHDA- 2009/05/09 09:00CRDT- 2009/04/11 09:00PHST- 2007/10/18 [received]PHST- 2008/09/04 [accepted]AID - S0124-00642008000400006 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Rev Salud Publica (Bogota). 2008 Aug-Oct;10(4):561-70.PMID- 19331478OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20090331DCOM- 20090602IS  - 1076-8998 (Print)IS  - 1076-8998 (Linking)VI  - 14IP  - 2DP  - 2009 AprTI  - Job stressors and the pursuit of sport activities: a day-level perspective.PG  - 165-81LID - 10.1037/a0014953 [doi]AB  - This article addresses the relation between day-specific experiences of job      stressors and the pursuit of off-job activities. Following the limited-resources       model of self-regulation, the authors proposed that job stressors and long      working hours are negatively related to pursuit of sport activities after work      because, after stressful days, employees have no resources left for initiating      and persisting in effortful behaviors such as sport. Routines for off-job      activities were hypothesized to be positively related to the pursuit of sport      activities after work. Seventy-eight police employees completed a daily survey      over 5 working days and indicated that they perceive sport to be highly useful      for recovery. Random coefficient modeling showed that job stressors (particularly      situational constraints) encountered on a specific day were negatively related to      self-regulatory resources and to the amount of time spent on sport activities      after work, whereas the relation with low-effort activities was positive. Thus,      after a stressful day when an effective recovery activity such as sport is highly      needed, persons tend to engage less in such an activity.FAU - Sonnentag, SabineAU  - Sonnentag SAD  - University of Konstanz, Department of Psychology, Konstanz, Germany.      sabine.sonnentag@uni-konstanz.deFAU - Jelden, StefanieAU  - Jelden SLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Multicenter StudyPL  - United StatesTA  - J Occup Health PsycholJT  - Journal of occupational health psychologyJID - 9612485SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - FemaleMH  - GermanyMH  - *Health BehaviorMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Mental Fatigue/etiology/psychologyMH  - Multivariate AnalysisMH  - Occupational Diseases/*prevention & control/psychologyMH  - PoliceMH  - *Social Control, InformalMH  - *SportsMH  - Stress, Psychological/*prevention & control/psychologyEDAT- 2009/04/01 09:00MHDA- 2009/06/03 09:00CRDT- 2009/04/01 09:00AID - 2009-03985-005 [pii]AID - 10.1037/a0014953 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Occup Health Psychol. 2009 Apr;14(2):165-81. doi: 10.1037/a0014953.PMID- 19326273OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20110411DCOM- 20110714IS  - 1477-2205 (Electronic)IS  - 1061-5806 (Linking)VI  - 23IP  - 2DP  - 2010TI  - The effect of perceived stress on the relationship between perfectionism and      burnout in coaches.PG  - 195-212LID - 10.1080/10615800802629922 [doi]AB  - The effects of perceived stress (PS) on the relationship between adaptive and      maladaptive forms of perfectionism and burnout were examined. Smith's      (1986)stress appraisal model and Kelley, Eklund, and Ritter-Taylor's (1999) model      of coach burnout were used to test two models of burnout in a sample of college      coaches (N=177). The results indicated that there is an indirect effect of      self-evaluative perfectionism (i.e., maladaptive form of perfectionism) on      burnout through PS as well as a significant direct link to burnout, accounting      for 56% of its variance. In contrast, conscientious perfectionism (CP) (i.e.,      adaptive perfectionism) did not directly impact burnout, nor was there an      indirect effect through PS. Based on Lazarus's (1999) ideas about stress      appraisal, the results suggested that maladaptive forms of perfectionism resulted      in more threatening perceptions of stress, thus, potentially leading to the      experience of burnout. However, adaptive forms of perfectionism did not seem to      result in increased appraisals of stress or result in burnout. The results did      indicate a significant correlation between the two forms of perfectionism, which       may explain why CP did not significantly impact PS or burnout.FAU - Tashman, Lauren SAU  - Tashman LSAD  - Department of Educational Psychology & Learning Systems, Florida State      University, Tallahassee, FL, USA. lst03@fsu.eduFAU - Tenenbaum, GershonAU  - Tenenbaum GFAU - Eklund, RobertAU  - Eklund RLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - EnglandTA  - Anxiety Stress CopingJT  - Anxiety, stress, and copingJID - 9212242SB  - IMMH  - Burnout, Professional/etiology/*psychologyMH  - FemaleMH  - FloridaMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - *PersonalityMH  - Personality InventoryMH  - Psychological TestsMH  - Sports/*psychologyMH  - Stress, Psychological/etiology/*psychologyMH  - Universities/manpowerEDAT- 2009/03/28 09:00MHDA- 2011/07/16 06:00CRDT- 2009/03/28 09:00AID - 909925317 [pii]AID - 10.1080/10615800802629922 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Anxiety Stress Coping. 2010;23(2):195-212. doi: 10.1080/10615800802629922.PMID- 19302200OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20090708DCOM- 20091015IS  - 1600-9657 (Electronic)IS  - 1600-4469 (Linking)VI  - 25IP  - 3DP  - 2009 JunTI  - Use of mouthguard rates among university athletes during sport activities in      Erzurum, Turkey.PG  - 318-22LID - 10.1111/j.1600-9657.2009.00769.x [doi]AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the attitudes of mouthguard users in      Erzurum, Turkey. The participants' appreciation in the use of protective devices,      such as mouthguards, during sport activities was also evaluated. In this study, a      10-item questionnaire was distributed to 50 coaches and a 10-item questionnaire      was distributed to 768 university athletes of three different sport modalities      (basketball, soccer and volleyball) in the Ataturk University Sport Competitions.      The Sport Competitions are composed of 20 faculty, except the faculty of      dentistry. The result of the coaches' questionnaires indicated that none of the      athletes used mouthguards while participating in sports. Of the coaches, 64% had       seen orofacial trauma in their athletes during sport activities and 76% believed       that mouthguards prevented oral injuries. Of the coaches, 76% reported that      university athletes should use mouthguards in sport activities. The result of the      university athletes' questionnaires revealed that the mouthguard utilization rate      was 0%. Of all players, 78.1% were males (age 17-29) and 21.9% were females (age       18-23). Of all players, 7.31% had suffered from one or more type of oral injury      while not wearing mouthguards. The results indicate that in Turkey, the use of      mouthguards is rare in sports. It should be a combined duty of dentists, sports      physicians, and coaches to encourage the use of mouthguards during training and      sport activities. Doctors and dentists need to recommend a more intensive      education of students in sports medicine and sports dentistry.FAU - Yesil Duymus, ZeynepAU  - Yesil Duymus ZAD  - Department of Prosthodontics, Faculty of Dentistry, Ataturk University, Erzurum,       Turkey. zyesilz@hotmail.comFAU - Gungor, HasanAU  - Gungor HLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20090227PL  - DenmarkTA  - Dent TraumatolJT  - Dental traumatology : official publication of International Association for      Dental TraumatologyJID - 101091305SB  - DMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - Athletic Injuries/*prevention & controlMH  - Basketball/statistics & numerical dataMH  - FemaleMH  - *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, PracticeMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Mouth Protectors/*utilizationMH  - Soccer/statistics & numerical dataMH  - Sports Equipment/*statistics & numerical dataMH  - Students/statistics & numerical dataMH  - TurkeyMH  - UniversitiesMH  - Volleyball/statistics & numerical dataMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2009/03/24 09:00MHDA- 2009/10/16 06:00CRDT- 2009/03/24 09:00PHST- 2009/02/27 [aheadofprint]AID - EDT769 [pii]AID - 10.1111/j.1600-9657.2009.00769.x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Dent Traumatol. 2009 Jun;25(3):318-22. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-9657.2009.00769.x.

Therefore, better      measures are needed to determine the psychological readiness of injured athletes       to return to sport participation. OBJECTIVE: To develop a scale that measures the      psychological readiness of injured athletes to return to sport participation and       to provide preliminary evidence of reliability and validity for the scale.      DESIGN: The Delphi method was used to develop the Injury-Psychological Readiness       to Return to Sport scale (I-PRRS). Two 1-way analyses of variance with repeated      measures and 6 Pearson product moment correlations were computed to help validate      the scale. SETTING: Athletic training clinics at 3 National Collegiate Athletic      Association (NCAA) schools. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Four certified      athletic trainers (ATs) and professors of Commission on Accreditation of Athletic      Training Education-accredited athletic training programs and 3 NCAA Division III       coaches made up a panel of experts that participated in the Delphi portion of the      study to develop the I-PRRS. In the second part of the study, 22 injured      athletes, who missed a minimum of 1 week of practice, from 3 NCAA schools in      Divisions II and III were surveyed along with their respective ATs. The injured      athletes and ATs participated in the validation of the I-PRRS. MAIN OUTCOME      MEASURE(S): The injured athlete completed the Profile of Mood States (POMS) short      form and the I-PRRS shortly after injury, before returning to the first practice,      before returning to competition, and immediately after competition. The      respective AT completed the I-PRRS before and after competition. The I-PRRS is a       6-item scale that measures the psychological readiness of injured athletes to      return to sport, and the POMS short form is a 30-item scale that measures mood      states. I added the negative moods of the POMS and subtracted the positive moods       of the POMS to calculate a Total Mood Disturbance (TMD) score. RESULTS: The      I-PRRS scores were negatively correlated with the TMD scores of the POMS short      form at all 4 time intervals, showing concurrent validity. The I-PRRS scores were      lowest after injury, increased before practice, increased again before      competition, and had no change after competition. The I-PRRS as completed by the       athlete and respective AT was positively correlated both before and after      practice, demonstrating external validity. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary evidence for       reliability and validity of the I-PRRS was demonstrated. The I-PRRS can be a      beneficial tool for ATs to assess an athlete's psychological readiness to return       to sport participation after injury.FAU - Glazer, Douglas DAU  - Glazer DDAD  - Endicott College, Department of Sport Science, Beverly, MA 01915, USA.      dglazer@endicott.eduLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Validation StudiesPL  - United StatesTA  - J Athl TrainJT  - Journal of athletic trainingJID - 9301647SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Analysis of VarianceMH  - Athletic Injuries/*psychology/*rehabilitationMH  - Cohort StudiesMH  - Delphi TechniqueMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - Injury Severity ScoreMH  - MaleMH  - PsychometricsMH  - Recovery of Function/*physiologyMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Sensitivity and SpecificityMH  - Sports/*psychologyMH  - Sports Medicine/standardsMH  - Stress, PsychologicalMH  - Young AdultPMC - PMC2657021OID - NLM: PMC2657021OTO - NOTNLMOT  - athletic injuriesOT  - confidenceOT  - psychologyEDAT- 2009/03/20 09:00MHDA- 2009/07/16 09:00CRDT- 2009/03/20 09:00AID - 10.4085/1062-6050-44.2.185 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Athl Train. 2009 Mar-Apr;44(2):185-9. doi: 10.4085/1062-6050-44.2.185.PMID- 19271821OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20090310DCOM- 20090511IS  - 0012-1649 (Print)IS  - 0012-1649 (Linking)VI  - 45IP  - 2DP  - 2009 MarTI  - The effects of autonomy-supportive coaching, need satisfaction, and      self-perceptions on initiative and identity in youth swimmers.PG  - 320-8LID - 10.1037/a0014027 [doi]AB  - This study tested a sequential process model linking youth sport coaching      climates (perceived coach behaviors and perceived need satisfaction) to youth      self-perceptions (perceived competence and global self-esteem) and youth      development outcomes (initiative, identity reflection, identity exploration). A      sample of 119 youth between the ages of 10 and 18 who participated in a      community-directed summer swim league completed questionnaires over the course of      the 7-week season. Results indicated that coaches' autonomy support, particularly      via process-focused praise, predicted youth competence need satisfaction and      relatedness need satisfaction in the coaching relationship. Youth competence need      satisfaction predicted self-esteem indirectly via perceived competence. Finally,       self-esteem predicted identity reflection, and perceived competence predicted      both identity reflection and initiative. Effects of age, sex, and perceptions of       direct contact with the coach were not significant. Findings suggest that the      quality of the coaching climate is an important predictor of the developmental      benefits of sport participation and that one pathway by which the coaching      climate has its effect on initiative and identity reflection is through      developing youth self-perceptions.FAU - Coatsworth, J DouglasAU  - Coatsworth JDAD  - Department of Human Development and Family Studies, The Pennsylvania State      University, University Park, PA 16802, USA. jdc15@psu.eduFAU - Conroy, David EAU  - Conroy DELA  - engGR  - HD42535/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralPL  - United StatesTA  - Dev PsycholJT  - Developmental psychologyJID - 0260564SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Athletic Performance/psychologyMH  - CharacterMH  - ChildMH  - Competitive BehaviorMH  - FemaleMH  - GoalsMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - *MotivationMH  - *Personal AutonomyMH  - *Personal SatisfactionMH  - *Self ConceptMH  - Social EnvironmentMH  - *Social IdentificationMH  - *Social SupportMH  - Swimming/*psychologyMH  - *TeachingEDAT- 2009/03/11 09:00MHDA- 2009/05/12 09:00CRDT- 2009/03/11 09:00AID - 2009-02701-003 [pii]AID - 10.1037/a0014027 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Dev Psychol. 2009 Mar;45(2):320-8. doi: 10.1037/a0014027.PMID- 19248412OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20090302DCOM- 20090409IS  - 1092-0811 (Print)IS  - 1092-0811 (Linking)VI  - 17IP  - 6DP  - 2008 DecTI  - First down!

Several infantry units in the Israel Defense Forces distributed      maxillary boil-and-bite mouthguards to their recruits. Target companies from      these battalions and from similar battalions (comparison group--mouthguards not      supplied), were selected. Soldiers were interviewed using a structured      questionnaire. Of the 630 male participants, 272 received a mouthguard and 358      served as the comparison group. No differences were found between groups      regarding demographic parameters or overall trauma cases. When compliance to a      free-of-charge distributed boil-and-bite mouthguard was assessed, 93 (34.2%)      participants reported using the mouthguard during sport activities. Compliance      was high for martial arts, but low for other sports. Although the number of      self-reported sport-related oral/dental trauma cases was similar between      mouthguard users and non-users, the users group showed less severe injuries.      However, free distribution to young amateur sportsmen does not affect oral and      dental trauma unless accompanied by education and motivation.FAU - Zadik, YehudaAU  - Zadik YAD  - Zrifin Central Dental Clinic, and Center for Health Promotion and Preventive      Medicine, Medical Corps, Israel Defense Forces, Jerusalem, Israel.FAU - Levin, LiranAU  - Levin LLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - DenmarkTA  - Dent TraumatolJT  - Dental traumatology : official publication of International Association for      Dental TraumatologyJID - 101091305SB  - DMH  - Athletic Injuries/*prevention & controlMH  - HumansMH  - IsraelMH  - MaleMH  - Maxillofacial Injuries/*prevention & controlMH  - Military PersonnelMH  - Mouth Protectors/*economics/*utilizationMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Sports Equipment/economicsMH  - Tooth Injuries/*prevention & controlMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2009/02/12 09:00MHDA- 2009/05/28 09:00CRDT- 2009/02/12 09:00AID - EDT708 [pii]AID - 10.1111/j.1600-9657.2008.00708.x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Dent Traumatol. 2009 Feb;25(1):69-72. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-9657.2008.00708.x.PMID- 19201766OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20101005DCOM- 20111122IS  - 1473-0480 (Electronic)IS  - 0306-3674 (Linking)VI  - 44IP  - 13DP  - 2010 OctTI  - A sports setting matrix for understanding the implementation context for      community sport.PG  - 973-8LID - 10.1136/bjsm.2008.056069 [doi]AB  - There has been increasing recognition of the need for effectiveness research      within the real-world intervention context of community sport. This is important       because, even if interventions have been shown to be efficacious in controlled      trials, if they are not also widely adopted and sustained, then it is unlikely      that they will have a public health impact. There is very little information      about how to best conduct such studies, but application of health promotion      frameworks, such as the RE-AIM framework, to evaluate the public health impact of      interventions could potentially help to understand the implementation context.      Care needs to be taken when directly applying the RE-AIM framework, however,      because the definitions for each of its dimensions will depend on the level/s the      intervention is targeted at. This paper provides a novel extension to the RE-AIM       framework (the RE-AIM Sports Setting Matrix (RE-AIM SSM)), which accounts for the      fact that many sports injury interventions need to be targeted at multiple levels      of sports delivery. Accordingly, the RE-AIM components also need to be measured      across all tiers of possible influence on the rate of uptake and effectiveness.      Specific examples are given for coachdelivered exercise training interventions.      The RE-AIM SSM is specific to the community sports setting implementation context      and could be used to guide the delivery of future sports safety, and other health      promotion, interventions in this area.FAU - Finch, C FAU  - Finch CFAD  - School of Human Movement and Sport Science, University of Ballarat, Mt Helen,      Victoria, 3353, Australia. c.finch@ballarat.edu.auFAU - Donaldson, AAU  - Donaldson ALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20090206PL  - EnglandTA  - Br J Sports MedJT  - British journal of sports medicineJID - 0432520SB  - IMMH  - Athletic Injuries/*prevention & controlMH  - Diffusion of InnovationMH  - Exercise Therapy/methodsMH  - Health PromotionMH  - HumansMH  - Residence CharacteristicsMH  - Safety ManagementEDAT- 2009/02/10 09:00MHDA- 2011/12/13 00:00CRDT- 2009/02/10 09:00PHST- 2009/02/06 [aheadofprint]PHST- 2010/05/19 [aheadofprint]AID - bjsm.2008.056069 [pii]AID - 10.1136/bjsm.2008.056069 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Br J Sports Med. 2010 Oct;44(13):973-8. doi: 10.1136/bjsm.2008.056069.

For children with disabilities, their injury risk may be complicated by      preexisting disability. However, very little research exists on sports injuries      to young athletes with disabilities. To best manage potential injuries to      children with disabilities, data on sports injury patterns are needed. The      purpose of this study was to measure the frequency of and risk factors for injury      to high school athletes with disabilities. METHODS: A total of 210 athletes from       8 special education high schools that are part of an interscholastic sports      league participated in the study. Seven of the 8 schools were followed for 1      season each of basketball, softball, soccer, and field hockey, and 1 school      enrolled only during field hockey. Data were collected from coaches on daily      exposure sessions (game, practice, and conditioning, as well as length of      session), athlete characteristics (disability, gender, age, seizure history, and       behavioral problems), and nature of injuries resulting in any type of medical      treatment. RESULTS: Thirty-eight injuries were reported among 512 special      athletes for a rate of 2.0 per 1000 athlete exposures. Soccer (3.7 per 1000) had       the highest rate of injury. More than half of the injuries were abrasions and      contusions. Those at highest risk for injury were athletes with autism, athletes       with histories of seizures, and starters. Athletes with autism had approximately       5 times the injury rate of athletes with mental disabilities. Athletes with      seizures had >2.5 times the rate of injury reported among those with no seizure      history. CONCLUSIONS: This adapted sports program is a reasonably safe activity      for children with disabilities. Nonetheless, findings have important implications      for prevention. The preparticipation medical examination may be an excellent      opportunity to create special guidelines, particularly for athletes with autism      and seizure history.FAU - Ramirez, MarizenAU  - Ramirez MAD  - Departments of Occupational and Environmental Health, College of Public Health,      University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USA. marizen-ramirez@uiowa.eduFAU - Yang, JingzhenAU  - Yang JFAU - Bourque, LindaAU  - Bourque LFAU - Javien, JohnAU  - Javien JFAU - Kashani, SamanAU  - Kashani SFAU - Limbos, Mary AnnAU  - Limbos MAFAU - Peek-Asa, CorinneAU  - Peek-Asa CLA  - engGR  - R49CCR703640/PHS HHS/United StatesGR  - R49CCR922457/PHS HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.PL  - United StatesTA  - PediatricsJT  - PediatricsJID - 0376422SB  - AIMSB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Athletic Injuries/*epidemiologyMH  - ChildMH  - *Disabled ChildrenMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2009/01/28 09:00MHDA- 2009/03/06 09:00CRDT- 2009/01/28 09:00AID - 123/2/690 [pii]AID - 10.1542/peds.2008-0603 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Pediatrics. 2009 Feb;123(2):690-6. doi: 10.1542/peds.2008-0603.PMID- 19160914OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20090123DCOM- 20090213IS  - 1056-6716 (Print)IS  - 1056-6716 (Linking)VI  - 17IP  - 4DP  - 2008 NovTI  - Sport psychology education: a preliminary survey on chartered physiotherapists'      preferred methods of training delivery.PG  - 399-412AB  - OBJECTIVE: To gain an insight to the existing suggestions and recommendations on       chartered physiotherapists' preferred methods of delivery for further training in      sport psychology. PARTICIPANTS: 22 delegates (14 women, 8 men) from the 2006      Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Sports Medicine/International      Federation of Sports Physiotherapy annual conference (response rate 53.7%).      MEASUREMENTS: A questionnaire survey for best method of sport psychology delivery      was developed. RESULTS: The most suitable methods for sport-psychology-training      delivery were workshops, seminars, mentoring, and coaching. Intense training days      and weekends were considered most appropriate. The vast majority were willing to       travel over 50 miles to receive training, and they indicated that the most      suitable organizations to arrange training would be professional bodies and      associations. CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide suggestions into how further      training in sport psychology for chartered physiotherapists could be delivered.      To gain more detailed information on these issues, however, further research with      a larger sample size is recommended.FAU - Arvinen-Barrow, MonnaAU  - Arvinen-Barrow MAD  - Sport and Exercise Psychology, The University of Northampton, Northampton NN2      7AL, UK.FAU - Hemmings, BrianAU  - Hemmings BFAU - Becker, Caryl AAU  - Becker CAFAU - Booth, LynnAU  - Booth LLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Sport RehabilJT  - Journal of sport rehabilitationJID - 9206500SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Athletic Injuries/psychology/*rehabilitationMH  - Athletic Performance/*education/*psychologyMH  - Congresses as TopicMH  - FemaleMH  - Health Care SurveysMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Physical Therapy Modalities/*education/psychologyMH  - PsychometricsMH  - QuestionnairesEDAT- 2009/01/24 09:00MHDA- 2009/02/14 09:00CRDT- 2009/01/24 09:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Sport Rehabil. 2008 Nov;17(4):399-412.PMID- 19142063OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20090114DCOM- 20090504IS  - 1710-2774 (Print)IS  - 1710-2774 (Linking)VI  - 12IP  - 1DP  - 2009TI  - The use of coaching to improve peri-operative efficiencies: the Ontario      experience.PG  - 48-54, 2AB  - Coaching has traditionally been associated with sports, where coaches help teams       and individuals focus on improving their athletic performance and achieving top      results.

Ninety-seven youth sports      clubs participated, and 273 sports club officials and 240 coaches answered the      questionnaires. To describe clubs health promotion orientations, an HPSC index      was created. The HPSC index was formulated on sub-indices by factor analysis. The      sub-indices were: policy, ideology, practice and environment indexes. The results      indicate that youth sports clubs are fairly health promoting in general. On      average, the clubs fulfilled 12 standards for HPSC out of 22. Every fourth club      was categorized as higher health promoting (> or = 15 fulfilled standards), and      every third as lower health promoting (<11 fulfilled standards). The variation      between clubs was wide. The clubs that had been recognized as exemplary and hence      certified by the Young Finland Association were more likely to recognize health      promotion than non-certified clubs (OR = 2.36, p = 0.016). The sports club      officials were twice as likely to evaluate their clubs as higher health promoting      than the coaches (OR = 2.04, p = 0.041). Under the sub-indices, ideologies were      recognized best, others less. These findings indicate that minority of the youth       sports clubs have realized health promotion comprehensively as a part of their      activities. There is a lot of need for development, especially in the area of      health promotion policies and practices.

The data were collected by a questionnaire assessing demographic      information, athletes' perceptions on their experience, their parents, teammates       and coach. t-tests revealed that current and former athletes were distinct on      numerous variables. A discriminant function analysis showed three proximal      predictors of sport dropout (perceived value of the activity, satisfaction,      parents' investment). Subsequent regression analyses showed that perceived value       was positively predicted by perceived competence, the value of the activity for      teammates, coach's investment, and negatively by conflicts of interest and goal      conflict with teammates; satisfaction was positively predicted by the coach's      mastery climate, but negatively predicted by conflicts of interest and goal      conflict with teammates and with the coach; parents investment was negatively      predicted by the goal conflicts with them. This study permitted to discriminate      between proximal and more distal psychological antecedents of the dropout      behaviour. It brings information relative to the possible targets of      interventions aiming at preventing dropout from organized sport. Key      pointsGeographical, financial and time constraints did not predict dropout from      organized sport.The value of the activity, the level of satisfaction of the      athlete, and the perceived parental investment, were identified as proximal      predictors of maintained participation.Athletes' perceptions about themselves      (perceived competence, conflict of interest) or their coach (investment, climate,      goal conflicts), peers (value, goal conflicts) or parents (goal conflicts), seem       to act as distal factors.FAU - Boiche, Julie C SAU  - Boiche JCAD  - University of La Reunion, France.FAU - Sarrazin, Philippe GAU  - Sarrazin PGLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20090301PL  - TurkeyTA  - J Sports Sci MedJT  - Journal of sports science & medicineJID - 101174629PMC - PMC3737782OID - NLM: PMC3737782OTO - NOTNLMOT  - PsychologyOT  - athletes.OT  - motivationOT  - public healthEDAT- 2009/01/01 00:00MHDA- 2009/01/01 00:01CRDT- 2013/10/24 06:00PHST- 2009/03 [ecollection]PHST- 2008/07/02 [received]PHST- 2008/09/18 [accepted]PHST- 2009/03/01 [epublish]PST - epublishSO  - J Sports Sci Med. 2009 Mar 1;8(1):9-16. eCollection 2009.PMID- 24149588OWN - NLMSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINEDA  - 20131023DCOM- 20131023LR  - 20140124IS  - 1303-2968 (Electronic)IS  - 1303-2968 (Linking)VI  - 8IP  - 4DP  - 2009TI  - The sports science of curling: a practical review.PG  - 495-500AB  - Curling is a sport played on ice in which two teams each deliver 8 granite stones      towards a target, or 'house'. It is the only sport in which the trajectory of the      projectile can be influenced after it has been released by the athlete. This is      achieved by sweeping the ice in front of the stone to change the stone-ice      friction and thereby enable to stone to travel further, curl more or stay      straight. Hard sweeping is physically demanding. Different techniques of sweeping      can also have different effects on the stone. This paper will review the current       research behind sweeping a curling stone, outline the physiological demands of      sweeping, the associated performance effects and suggest potential strategies of       sweeping that can be used by both coaches and curling teams. Key pointsSweeping a      curling stone can be highly physically demanding.Effective sweeping requires a      combination of downward force and brush head speed, determined by the stone      velocity.Sweeping on the left or right of a stone can help the stone to remain      straight or curl more depending on the rotation of the stone.This can lead to the      development of sweeping and playing tactics and contribute to team selection.FAU - Bradley, John LAU  - Bradley JLAD  - Department of Education, University College Cork , Cork, Ireland.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20091201PL  - TurkeyTA  - J Sports Sci MedJT  - Journal of sports science & medicineJID - 101174629PMC - PMC3761524OID - NLM: PMC3761524OTO - NOTNLMOT  - SweepingOT  - physiological demandsOT  - sweep strategyOT  - trainingOT  - winter sportsEDAT- 2009/01/01 00:00MHDA- 2009/01/01 00:01CRDT- 2013/10/24 06:00PHST- 2009/12 [ecollection]PHST- 2009/07/10 [received]PHST- 2009/10/02 [accepted]PHST- 2009/12/01 [epublish]PST - epublishSO  - J Sports Sci Med. 2009 Dec 1;8(4):495-500. eCollection 2009.PMID- 19097766OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20090112DCOM- 20090424IS  - 0929-693X (Print)IS  - 0929-693X (Linking)VI  - 16IP  - 1DP  - 2009 JanTI  - [Anorexia athletica's place in female sports athletes].PG  - 88-92LID - 10.1016/j.arcped.2008.10.021 [doi]AB  - This work analyzes the links between eating disorders and intensive exercise      training and tries to define the anorexia athletica's place in this context.      Through a review of the literature, we examined the arguments favoring the      hypothesis of a "princeps" disorder, which would orientate girls towards some      sports, and the arguments, which emphasize the capacity of some sports to lead to      the apparition of these eating disorders. The description of a clinical case      allows the evocation of the complexity of this relationship showing that      intensive exercise training may be a facilitatory factor as well as a limitatory       factor of the severity of the anorexia nervosa. In this situation, it seems      interesting to use the anorexia athletica's concept to improve coach and doctor's      vigilance around the young female athlete. Lastly, we propose to replace the      concept of sport by "exercise practice" where the intensity, the sport      "centration", the weight stress became risk factors and to define populations at       risk (adolescents, females). Based on these data, prevention actions should be      started in populations particularly exposed.FAU - Afflelou, SAU  - Afflelou SAD  - CAPS, hopital Saint-Andre, Bordeaux, France. sabine.afflelou@chu-bordeaux.frLA  - frePT  - Case ReportsPT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticleTT  - Place de l'anorexia athletica chez la sportive intensive.DEP - 20081220PL  - FranceTA  - Arch PediatrJT  - Archives de pediatrie : organe officiel de la Societe francaise de pediatrieJID - 9421356SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - *Anorexia Nervosa/diagnosis/prevention & control/psychology/therapyMH  - *Body ImageMH  - *Bulimia/diagnosis/prevention & control/psychology/therapyMH  - ChildMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Sex FactorsMH  - *SportsMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2008/12/23 09:00MHDA- 2009/04/25 09:00CRDT- 2008/12/23 09:00PHST- 2007/03/26 [received]PHST- 2008/10/16 [revised]PHST- 2008/10/30 [accepted]PHST- 2008/12/20 [aheadofprint]AID - S0929-693X(08)00539-3 [pii]AID - 10.1016/j.arcped.2008.10.021 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Arch Pediatr. 2009 Jan;16(1):88-92. doi: 10.1016/j.arcped.2008.10.021.

A small-size      descriptive study was conducted in both sports, to assess the efficacy of      integrating sports injury prevention into coach education. NetballSmart was      evaluated at the end of 2005, via a telephone survey of 217 coaches (53% response      rate) who had attended a NetballSmart course earlier in the year. SoccerSmart was      evaluated at the start of 2007, via an Internet questionnaire completed by 71      coaches (20% response rate) who had attended a SoccerSmart course in 2006. The      evaluations focused on the quality and use of the course resource material, as      well as assessing the extent to which coaches had incorporated injury prevention       behaviours into player practices. After attending a NetballSmart course, 89% of      coaches changed the way they coached, with 95% reported using knowledge from the       course and passing it on to players. Ninety-six percent of football/soccer      coaches also changed the way they coached, with most change relating to      warm-up/cool-down and stretch (65%), technique (63%), fitness (60%) and      nutrition/hydration (58%) practices. Although this was a descriptive study in      nature, with a small sample size, we conclude that integration of injury      prevention content within coach education courses and resources may be a viable      and effective strategy to help community coaches--and therefore community      players--help reduce their risk of injury.CI  - Copyright (c) 2008 Sports Medicine Australia.

Real-time or near-real-time feedback can be more helpful to coaches and      athletes than delayed feedback. The purpose of this study was to validate      measures obtained by a commercially available accelerometer in comparison with      kinematic data derived from video. The hypothesis was that there would be a high       positive relationship between accelerometer data and acceleration measures      derived from video records of a barbell high-pull movement. Accelerometer values       and kinematic data from high-speed video were obtained from 7 volunteers      performing 2 trials each of a barbell high-pull. The results showed that the      accelerometer measures were highly correlated with derived acceleration data from      video (r = 0.94-0.99). On the basis of these results, the device was considered      to be validated; thus, the unit may be a useful tool to measure acceleration      during real-time training sessions rather than only reserved for collecting data       in a laboratory setting. This device can be a valuable tool to provide instant      feedback to coaches and athletes to assess individual barbell acceleration      performance.FAU - Sato, KimitakeAU  - Sato KAD  - Department of Sport and Exercise Science, University of Northern Colorado,      Greeley, Colorado, USA. jpnsatok@hotmail.comFAU - Smith, Sarah LAU  - Smith SLFAU - Sands, William AAU  - Sands WALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Validation StudiesPL  - United StatesTA  - J Strength Cond ResJT  - Journal of strength and conditioning research / National Strength & Conditioning       AssociationJID - 9415084SB  - IMMH  - *AccelerationMH  - AdultMH  - Athletic Performance/*physiologyMH  - Biomechanical PhenomenaMH  - Equipment DesignMH  - Equipment SafetyMH  - Exercise Test/*instrumentationMH  - HumansMH  - Kinesiology, Applied/instrumentationMH  - MaleMH  - Resistance Training/*instrumentation/methodsMH  - Sensitivity and SpecificityMH  - Video RecordingMH  - Weight Lifting/*physiologyMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2008/12/04 09:00MHDA- 2009/05/06 09:00CRDT- 2008/12/04 09:00AID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181876a01 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Strength Cond Res. 2009 Jan;23(1):341-7. doi: 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181876a01.PMID- 19030142OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20081125DCOM- 20090303LR  - 20140902IS  - 1938-162X (Electronic)IS  - 1062-6050 (Linking)VI  - 43IP  - 6DP  - 2008 Oct-DecTI  - Research methodology: endocrinologic measurements in exercise science and sports       medicine.PG  - 631-9LID - 10.4085/1062-6050-43.6.631 [doi]AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide background information on methodologic factors that      influence and add variance to endocrine outcome measurements. Our intent is to      aid and improve the quality of exercise science and sports medicine research      endeavors of investigators inexperienced in endocrinology. BACKGROUND: Numerous      methodologic factors influence human endocrine (hormonal) measurements and,      consequently, can dramatically compromise the accuracy and validity of exercise      and sports medicine research. These factors can be categorized into those that      are biologic and those that are procedural-analytic in nature. RECOMMENDATIONS:      Researchers should design their studies to monitor, control, and adjust for the      biologic and procedural-analytic factors discussed within this paper. By doing      so, they will find less variance in their hormonal outcomes and thereby will      increase the validity of their physiologic data. These actions can assist the      researcher in the interpretation and understanding of endocrine data and, in      turn, make their research more scientifically sound.FAU - Hackney, Anthony CAU  - Hackney ACAD  - University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA.      ach@email.unc.eduFAU - Viru, AtkoAU  - Viru ALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Athl TrainJT  - Journal of athletic trainingJID - 9301647RN  - 0 (Gonadal Steroid Hormones)SB  - IMMH  - Age FactorsMH  - Biological AssayMH  - Circadian RhythmMH  - Continental Population GroupsMH  - Endocrine System/*physiologyMH  - Exercise/*physiologyMH  - FemaleMH  - Gonadal Steroid Hormones/*analysisMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Menstrual CycleMH  - Mental HealthMH  - *ResearchMH  - Sex FactorsMH  - Sports Medicine/*methodsPMC - PMC2582556OID - NLM: PMC2582556OTO - NOTNLMOT  - biomedical sciencesOT  - hormonesOT  - sport research designOT  - study designEDAT- 2008/11/26 09:00MHDA- 2009/03/04 09:00CRDT- 2008/11/26 09:00AID - 10.4085/1062-6050-43.6.631 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Athl Train. 2008 Oct-Dec;43(6):631-9. doi: 10.4085/1062-6050-43.6.631.PMID- 19026019OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20081125DCOM- 20090303IS  - 0112-1642 (Print)IS  - 0112-1642 (Linking)VI  - 38IP  - 12DP  - 2008TI  - A review of vision-based motion analysis in sport.PG  - 1025-43LID - 10.2165/00007256-200838120-00006 [doi]AB  - Efforts at player motion tracking have traditionally involved a range of data      collection techniques from live observation to post-event video analysis where      player movement patterns are manually recorded and categorized to determine      performance effectiveness. Due to the considerable time required to manually      collect and analyse such data, research has tended to focus only on small numbers      of players within predefined playing areas. Whilst notational analysis is a      convenient, practical and typically inexpensive technique, the validity and      reliability of the process can vary depending on a number of factors, including      how many observers are used, their experience, and the quality of their viewing      perspective. Undoubtedly the application of automated tracking technology to team      sports has been hampered because of inadequate video and computational facilities      available at sports venues. However, the complex nature of movement inherent to      many physical activities also represents a significant hurdle to overcome.      Athletes tend to exhibit quick and agile movements, with many unpredictable      changes in direction and also frequent collisions with other players. Each of      these characteristics of player behaviour violate the assumptions of smooth      movement on which computer tracking algorithms are typically based. Systems such       as TRAKUS, SoccerMan, TRAKPERFORMANCE, Pfinder and Prozone all provide extrinsic       feedback information to coaches and athletes. However, commercial tracking      systems still require a fair amount of operator intervention to process the data       after capture and are often limited by the restricted capture environments that      can be used and the necessity for individuals to wear tracking devices. Whilst      some online tracking systems alleviate the requirements of manual tracking, to      our knowledge a completely automated system suitable for sports performance is      not yet commercially available. Automatic motion tracking has been used      successfully in other domains outside of elite sport performance, notably for      surveillance in the military and security industry where automatic recognition of      moving objects is achievable because identification of the objects is not      necessary. The current challenge is to obtain appropriate video sequences that      can robustly identify and label people over time, in a cluttered environment      containing multiple interacting people. This problem is often compounded by the      quality of video capture, the relative size and occlusion frequency of people,      and also changes in illumination. Potential applications of an automated motion      detection system are offered, such as: planning tactics and strategies; measuring      team organisation; providing meaningful kinematic feedback; and objective      measures of intervention effectiveness in team sports, which could benefit      coaches, players, and sports scientists.FAU - Barris, SianAU  - Barris SAD  - Human Performance Centre, School of Physical Education, University of Otago,      Dunedin, New Zealand. sian.barris@otago.ac.nzFAU - Button, ChrisAU  - Button CLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - New ZealandTA  - Sports MedJT  - Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)JID - 8412297SB  - IMMH  - HumansMH  - Motion Perception/*physiologyMH  - Movement/*physiologyMH  - SoftwareMH  - Sports/*physiologyMH  - *Time and Motion StudiesMH  - Video Recording/*instrumentationRF  - 75EDAT- 2008/11/26 09:00MHDA- 2009/03/04 09:00CRDT- 2008/11/26 09:00AID - 6 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Sports Med. 2008;38(12):1025-43. doi: 10.2165/00007256-200838120-00006.PMID- 18986035OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20081106DCOM- 20090107IS  - 0031-5125 (Print)IS  - 0031-5125 (Linking)VI  - 107IP  - 1DP  - 2008 AugTI  - Development and factor analysis of the Coaching and Athletic Training      Questionnaire.PG  - 81-8AB  - To explore athletes' perceptions related to coaching and athletic training care,       the Coaching and Athletic Training Questionnaire was developed. A 10-item version      was administered to 708 varsity athletes from three Division I universities in      the National Collegiate Athletic Association. 341 women and 344 men completed      questionnaires. Data from half of the sample of 685 were used for an exploratory       factor analysis using principal components analysis with oblique rotation and the      second half for a confirmatory factor analysis. Analyses yielded three      interpretable factors, accounting for 68% of the variance, which were labeled      Comfort with Athletic Trainer or Coach, Sex Influence on Quality of Care, and      Athletic Trainer Preference. Multivariate analysis of variance indicated that      factor scores of women and men differed significantly, and at followup women and       men differed significantly on Comfort with Athletic Trainer or Coach, but the      small effect size minimizes its meaningfulness. No significant difference was      noted for the other two factors. It appears coaches should be sensitive and      available in case of injury or other need. Athletes' perceived quality of care by      athletic trainers does not appear related to sex of athlete or trainer.FAU - Drummond, Jan LAU  - Drummond JLAD  - School of Nursing, The University of Tulsa, 800 South Tucker Drive, Tulsa, OK      74104-9700, USA. jan-drummond@utulsa.eduFAU - Hostetter, Karen SAU  - Hostetter KSFAU - Ploeger, Robin LAU  - Ploeger RLLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Percept Mot SkillsJT  - Perceptual and motor skillsJID - 0401131SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - Athletic Injuries/psychology/rehabilitationMH  - Athletic Performance/psychology/statistics & numerical dataMH  - Attitude to HealthMH  - Factor Analysis, StatisticalMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - Interpersonal RelationsMH  - MaleMH  - Occupations/standards/statistics & numerical dataMH  - Personal SatisfactionMH  - Principal Component AnalysisMH  - *QuestionnairesMH  - Sex FactorsMH  - Sports/*education/*psychology/statistics & numerical dataMH  - Students/psychology/statistics & numerical dataMH  - Teaching/methods/*statistics & numerical dataMH  - UniversitiesEDAT- 2008/11/07 09:00MHDA- 2009/01/08 09:00CRDT- 2008/11/07 09:00AID - 10.2466/pms.107.1.81-88 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Percept Mot Skills. 2008 Aug;107(1):81-8.PMID- 18979324OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20081103DCOM- 20081202IS  - 1096-4673 (Electronic)IS  - 0161-2840 (Linking)VI  - 29IP  - 11DP  - 2008 NovTI  - Social support for and through exercise and sport in a sample of men with serious      mental illness.PG  - 1179-99LID - 10.1080/01612840802370640 [doi]AB  - Social support is important for people experiencing serious mental illness and is      also important during the initiation and maintenance of exercise. In this article      we draw on interpretive research into the experiences of 11 men with serious      mental illness to explore four dimensions of social support both for and through       exercise. Our findings suggest that informational, tangible, esteem, and      emotional support were both provided for and given by participants through      exercise. We conclude that experiences of both receiving and giving diverse forms      of support in this way are significant for some people living with and recovering      from serious mental illness.FAU - Carless, DavidAU  - Carless DAD  - Leeds Metropolitan University, Beckett Park, Leeds, United Kingdom.      d.carless@leedsmet.ac.ukFAU - Douglas, KitrinaAU  - Douglas KLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Issues Ment Health NursJT  - Issues in mental health nursingJID - 7907126SB  - NMH  - Adaptation, PsychologicalMH  - AdultMH  - Anthropology, CulturalMH  - *Attitude to HealthMH  - EmotionsMH  - Exercise/*psychologyMH  - Health Knowledge, Attitudes, PracticeMH  - Health Promotion/methodsMH  - HumansMH  - Interpersonal RelationsMH  - MaleMH  - Men/education/*psychologyMH  - *Mental Disorders/prevention & control/psychologyMH  - Models, PsychologicalMH  - MotivationMH  - NarrationMH  - Nursing Methodology ResearchMH  - Patient Education as TopicMH  - Psychiatric Nursing/methodsMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Self ConceptMH  - Social IdentificationMH  - *Social SupportMH  - Sports/*psychologyEDAT- 2008/11/04 09:00MHDA- 2008/12/17 09:00CRDT- 2008/11/04 09:00AID - 905010246 [pii]AID - 10.1080/01612840802370640 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Issues Ment Health Nurs. 2008 Nov;29(11):1179-99. doi: 10.1080/01612840802370640.PMID- 18971511OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20081030DCOM- 20090109IS  - 0895-2779 (Print)IS  - 0895-2779 (Linking)VI  - 30IP  - 5DP  - 2008 OctTI  - Passion in sport: on the quality of the coach-athlete relationship.PG  - 541-60AB  - Vallerand et al. (2003) developed a dualistic model of passion, wherein two types      of passion are proposed: harmonious (HP) and obsessive (OP) passion that predict       adaptive and less adaptive interpersonal outcomes, respectively. In the present      research, we were interested in understanding the role of passion in the quality       of coach-athlete relationships. Results of Study 1, conducted with athletes      (N=157), revealed that HP positively predicts a high-quality coach-athlete      relationship, whereas OP was largely unrelated to such relationships. Study 2 was      conducted with coaches (N=106) and showed that only HP positively predicted the      quality of the coach-athlete relationship. Furthermore, these effects were fully       mediated by positive emotions. Finally, the quality of the coach-athlete      relationship positively predicted coaches' subjective well-being. Future research      directions are discussed in light of the dualistic model of passion.FAU - Lafreniere, Marc-Andre KAU  - Lafreniere MAAD  - Departement de Psychologie, Laboratoire de Recherche sur le Comportement Social,       Universite du Quebec a Montreal, QC, Canada.FAU - Jowett, SophiaAU  - Jowett SFAU - Vallerand, Robert JAU  - Vallerand RJFAU - Gonahue, Eric GAU  - Gonahue EGFAU - Lorimer, RossAU  - Lorimer RLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Sport Exerc PsycholJT  - Journal of sport & exercise psychologyJID - 8809258SB  - IMMH  - AchievementMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - Competitive BehaviorMH  - EmotionsMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - *Interpersonal RelationsMH  - JudgmentMH  - *LeadershipMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - *MotivationMH  - Physical Education and TrainingMH  - Sports/*psychologyMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2008/10/31 09:00MHDA- 2009/01/10 09:00CRDT- 2008/10/31 09:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Sport Exerc Psychol. 2008 Oct;30(5):541-60.PMID- 18949920OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20081027DCOM- 20081113LR  - 20130715IS  - 1330-0164 (Print)IS  - 1330-0164 (Linking)VI  - 61 Suppl 1DP  - 2007TI  - [Sports injuries of temporomandibular joints and oral muscles in basketball      players].PG  - 19-22AB  - All sporting activities have an associated risk of orofacial injuries due to      falls, collisions with players, devices, and hard surfaces. Many authors have      reported about incidence of orofacial injuries during sports activities. Flanders      and Bhat concluded that 34% of all injuries in basketball are orofacial injuries,      while orofacial injuries account for only 0.07% of all injuries in American      football. AIM, METHODS AND EXAMINEES: The aim of this investigation was to      identify the incidence, type and severity of temporomandibular joint injuries,      stiffness and pain in oral muscles, and pain during opening and closure of the      mouth while playing basketball. The sample consisted of 195 basketball players,      135 professionals and 60 non-professionals. They filled out the questionnaire      individually with help of the researchers. RESULTS: The data received by the      survey revealed a total of 350 temporomandibular joint injuries and/or pain, oral      muscles stiffness and pain during opening and closure of the mouth during      basketball career. The incidence of injuries was higher in professional 72.6%      (254) than in non-professional players 27.4% (96). Twenty-four professional and 9      non-professional players reported pain or oral muscles stiffness, while 58      professional and 15 non-professional players reported pain during opening and      closing the mouth. Only 1 non-professional player and 6 professional players      reported injuries of the temporomandibular joint. All basketball players who were      injured during their career had more than one injury. During career, professional      players reported pain while opening and closing of the mouth more often than      non-professional players, on the average 1.3 and 0.9 times, respectively. Pain or      oral muscles stiffness during basketball career was reported 0.6 times on the      average by non-professional players, as compared to 0.5 times by professional      players. Non-professional players reported 5.2% injuries of temporomandibular      joints during their career, while professional players only 3.2%. With regard to       positions in the team, most injuries of temporomandibular joints, stiffness and      pain in oral muscles were reported by forwards, on the average 2.33 incidents.      Centers were the second most frequently injured group with an average of 1.96      incidents, followed by point guards with 1.74, power forwards with 1.62 and      guards with 1.55 incidents. CONCLUSION: Only 2 basketball players (1%) frequently      used a mouthguard and 93.3% of them never even tried to wear a mouthguard.      Implementation of mandatory mouthguard usage in sports, such as basketball, would      decrease such a large number of sports injuries. Mouthguards would absorb the      force of impact and consequently stiffness and pain in oral muscles so that      injuries of temporomandibular joints would be reduced or even avoided. Such a low      percentage of mouthguard use in basketball players reflects poor awareness and      education of both athletes and coaches, as well as an insufficient role of      dentists in sports medicine and education.FAU - Lesic, NikolinaAU  - Lesic NAD  - nikolina.dilberovic@zg.t-com.hrFAU - Seifert, DavorAU  - Seifert DFAU - Jerolimov, VjekoslavAU  - Jerolimov VLA  - hrvPT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticleTT  - Sportske ozljedetemporomandibularnih zglobova i zvacnih misica u kosarkasa.PL  - CroatiaTA  - Acta Med CroaticaJT  - Acta medica Croatica : casopis Hravatske akademije medicinskih znanostiJID - 9208249SB  - IMMH  - Basketball/*injuriesMH  - HumansMH  - Mouth/*injuriesMH  - Mouth ProtectorsMH  - Temporomandibular Joint/*injuriesEDAT- 2008/10/28 09:00MHDA- 2008/11/14 09:00CRDT- 2008/10/28 09:00PST - ppublishSO  - Acta Med Croatica. 2007;61 Suppl 1:19-22.PMID- 18940102OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20081022DCOM- 20081217IS  - 0214-9915 (Print)IS  - 0214-9915 (Linking)VI  - 20IP  - 4DP  - 2008 NovTI  - [Development of a scale to measure leadership capacity of players in sports      teams].PG  - 913-7AB  - This study describes the process of developing a scale to measure the leadership       capacity of players in sports teams. Research into sports leadership has focused       almost exclusively on the formal leadership of the coach, in which the studies by      Chelladurai, with his five-factor model, have become an essential point of      reference. Nevertheless, hardly any research has been carried out into the      leadership that certain players exercise over the other team members. For this      purpose, a sample of 143 male basketball players was used; these participants      were asked to evaluate the characteristics of the sports leader over a total of      54 indicators. Firstly, explanatory factor analysis was performed with      participants' responses, using principal axis and oblique rotation methods. The      factor structure obtained was then subjected to confirmatory factorial analysis,       enabling us to propose a Sports Leader Evaluation Scale (EELD, in Spanish) with      18 items grouped into 3 factors, denominated empathy and responsibility,      assertiveness, and impulsiveness. Satisfactory fit indices were obtained for the       model, for the reliability of items and for the internal consistency of factors.FAU - Arce, ConstantinoAU  - Arce CAD  - Facultad de Psicologia, Universidad de Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de      Compostela, Spain. constantino.arce@usc.esFAU - Torrado, JulioAU  - Torrado JFAU - Andrade, ElenaAU  - Andrade EFAU - Garrido, JavierAU  - Garrido JFAU - de Francisco, CristinaAU  - de Francisco CLA  - spaPT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticleTT  - Elaboracion de una escala para la medida de la capacidad de liderazgo de los      deportistas de equipo.PL  - SpainTA  - PsicothemaJT  - PsicothemaJID - 101189384SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - *Cooperative BehaviorMH  - HumansMH  - *LeadershipMH  - *QuestionnairesMH  - *SportsEDAT- 2008/10/23 09:00MHDA- 2008/12/18 09:00CRDT- 2008/10/23 09:00PST - ppublishSO  - Psicothema. 2008 Nov;20(4):913-7.PMID- 18816941OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20080926DCOM- 20090108IS  - 0270-1367 (Print)IS  - 0270-1367 (Linking)VI  - 79IP  - 3DP  - 2008 SepTI  - A confirmatory study of rating scale category effectiveness for the Coaching      Efficacy Scale.PG  - 300-11AB  - This study extended validity evidence for measures of coaching efficacy derived      from the Coaching Efficacy Scale (CES) by testing the rating scale      categorizations suggested in previous research. Previous research provided      evidence for the effectiveness of a four-category (4-CAT) structure for high      school and collegiate sports coaches; it also suggested that a five-category      (5-CAT) structure may be effective for youth sports coaches, because they may be       more likely to endorse categories on the lower end of the scale. Coaches of youth      sports (N = 492) responded to the CES items with a 5-CAT structure. Across rating      scale category effectiveness guidelines, 32 of 34 evidences (94%) provided      support for this structure. Data were condensed to a 4-CAT structure by      collapsing responses in Category 1 (CAT-1) and Category 2 (CAT-2). Across rating       scale category effectiveness guidelines, 25 of 26 evidences (96%) provided      support for this structure. Findings provided confirmatory, cross-validation      evidence for both the 5-CAT and 4-CAT structures. For empirical, theoretical, and      practical reasons, the authors concluded that the 4-CAT structure was preferable       to the 5-CAT when CES items are used to measure coaching efficacy. This      conclusion is based on the findings of this confirmatory study and the more      exploratory findings of Myers, Wolfe, and Feltz (2005).FAU - Myers, Nicholas DAU  - Myers NDAD  - Department of Educational and Psychological Studies, University of Miami, Coral      Gables, FL 33124-2040, USA. nmyers@miami.eduFAU - Feltz, Deborah LAU  - Feltz DLFAU - Wolfe, Edward WAU  - Wolfe EWLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - United StatesTA  - Res Q Exerc SportJT  - Research quarterly for exercise and sportJID - 8006373SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - ChildMH  - *ExerciseMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - MentorsMH  - Models, StatisticalMH  - Physical Education and Training/*methodsMH  - Professional CompetenceMH  - Psychometrics/*methodsMH  - Reproducibility of ResultsMH  - Self EfficacyMH  - Sports/*education/physiology/psychologyEDAT- 2008/09/27 09:00MHDA- 2009/01/09 09:00CRDT- 2008/09/27 09:00AID - 10.1080/02701367.2008.10599493 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Res Q Exerc Sport. 2008 Sep;79(3):300-11.PMID- 18806551OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20080922DCOM- 20081215IS  - 1536-3724 (Electronic)IS  - 1050-642X (Linking)VI  - 18IP  - 5DP  - 2008 SepTI  - Characterizing the perception of the placebo effect in sports medicine.PG  - 432-7LID - 10.1097/JSM.0b013e318185362a [doi]AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize differences in the perception and understanding of the      placebo effect between sports physicians, coaches, athletes, and sports science      personnel. DESIGN: A short 11-item questionnaire was administered addressing      demographic details, understanding of the placebo effect, and willingness to use       the effect in an elite sport setting. SETTING: All participants were involved in       national level sporting programs. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 187 individuals (17      sports physicians, 44 sports scientists, 30 national-level coaches, and 96      national-level athletes) completed the questionnaire. All participants were      contacted and invited to participate voluntarily. INTERVENTIONS/ASSESSMENT OF      RISK FACTORS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported responses       on understanding and use of placebo effect in sport. RESULTS: A total of 94% of      physicians and 98% of scientists, but only 44% of athletes, indicated a good      understanding of the placebo effect. A majority of scientists (63%) and      physicians (59%) administered placebo at least once a year. Most of scientists      (95%) and a majority of physicians (71%) either mildly or strongly encouraged use      of the placebo in their clinical practice. About 60% of athletes indicated they      would not care if they were unknowingly administered a placebo: however, 30% of      them would not appreciate being misled. CONCLUSIONS: There is a substantial      difference in the level of understanding of the placebo effect between physicians      and athletes in elite sport. Although athletes are willing to use the placebo      effect, physicians need to be mindful of the manner of its implementation.FAU - Brooling, JohnAU  - Brooling JAD  - Faculty of Medicine, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia.FAU - Pyne, DavidAU  - Pyne DFAU - Fallon, KieranAU  - Fallon KFAU - Fricker, PeterAU  - Fricker PLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Clin J Sport MedJT  - Clinical journal of sport medicine : official journal of the Canadian Academy of       Sport MedicineJID - 9103300SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - AustraliaMH  - FemaleMH  - *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, PracticeMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - *Placebo EffectMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - *Sports MedicineMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2008/09/23 09:00MHDA- 2008/12/17 09:00CRDT- 2008/09/23 09:00AID - 10.1097/JSM.0b013e318185362a [doi]AID - 00042752-200809000-00011 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Clin J Sport Med. 2008 Sep;18(5):432-7. doi: 10.1097/JSM.0b013e318185362a.PMID- 18806544OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20080922DCOM- 20081215IS  - 1536-3724 (Electronic)IS  - 1050-642X (Linking)VI  - 18IP  - 5DP  - 2008 SepTI  - Twelve-month outcomes of serious orthopaedic sport and active recreation-related       injuries admitted to Level 1 trauma centers in Melbourne, Australia.PG  - 387-93LID - 10.1097/JSM.0b013e3181859f8d [doi]AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe and identify predictors of 12-month outcomes of serious      orthopaedic injuries due to sport and active recreation. DESIGN: Prospective      cohort study with 12-month follow-up. SETTING: Two Level 1 adult trauma centers      in Victoria, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 366 adults admitted to two Level      1 trauma centers for an orthopaedic sport and active recreation injury between      August 2003 and March 2006. Patients were captured by the Victorian Orthopaedic      Trauma Outcomes Registry (VOTOR), followed up at 12 months, and were free of      moderate to severe disability prior to injury. ASSESSMENT OF RISK FACTORS:      Independent variables assessed for predictors of outcome were sporting group,      age, sex, marital status, education level, Injury Severity Score, injury      patterns, and head injury status. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: The 12-item Short      Form Health Survey and maximum pain scores. RESULTS: At 12 months postinjury,      22.8% of patients reported moderate to severe physical disability, 12.1% reported      moderate to severe mental health disability, and 11.1% reported moderate to      severe pain. There were significant differences in physical outcomes between      sporting groups, with motor and equestrian sports reporting the worst physical      outcomes. Multivariate analysis indentified increasing age (P = 0.010) and      patterns of injury (P = 0.040) as significant predictors of a poor physical      outcome at 12 months. No significant independent predictors of outcome for mental      health and maximum pain at 12 months were identified. CONCLUSION: Almost      one-quarter of participants reported moderate to severe physical disability at 12      months postinjury. Increasing age and patterns of injury were found to be      significant predictors of a poor physical outcome at 12 months.FAU - Andrew, Nadine EAU  - Andrew NEAD  - Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne,      Victoria, Australia.FAU - Gabbe, Belinda JAU  - Gabbe BJFAU - Wolfe, RoryAU  - Wolfe RFAU - Williamson, Owen DAU  - Williamson ODFAU - Richardson, Martin DAU  - Richardson MDFAU - Edwards, Elton RAU  - Edwards ERFAU - Cameron, Peter AAU  - Cameron PALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - United StatesTA  - Clin J Sport MedJT  - Clinical journal of sport medicine : official journal of the Canadian Academy of       Sport MedicineJID - 9103300SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Athletic Injuries/epidemiology/*physiopathologyMH  - Cohort StudiesMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - *OrthopedicsMH  - *Outcome Assessment (Health Care)MH  - Prospective StudiesMH  - Recreation/*physiologyMH  - Regression AnalysisMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Sports/*physiologyMH  - *Trauma Centers/utilizationMH  - VictoriaMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2008/09/23 09:00MHDA- 2008/12/17 09:00CRDT- 2008/09/23 09:00AID - 10.1097/JSM.0b013e3181859f8d [doi]AID - 00042752-200809000-00004 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Clin J Sport Med. 2008 Sep;18(5):387-93. doi: 10.1097/JSM.0b013e3181859f8d.PMID- 18803066OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20081014DCOM- 20090304IS  - 0264-0414 (Print)IS  - 0264-0414 (Linking)VI  - 26IP  - 12DP  - 2008 OctTI  - On passion and sports fans: a look at football.PG  - 1279-93LID - 10.1080/02640410802123185 [doi]AB  - The purpose of the present research was to test the applicability of the      Dualistic Model of Passion (Vallerand et al., 2003) to being a sport (football)      fan. Three studies provided support for this dualistic conceptualization of      passion. Study 1 showed that harmonious passion was positively associated with      adaptive behaviours (e.g. celebrate the team's victory), whereas obsessive      passion was positively associated with maladaptive behaviours (e.g. risking      losing one's job to go to a game). Study 2 used a short Passion Scale and showed       that harmonious passion was positively related to the positive affective life of       fans during the 2006 FIFA World Cup, psychological health (self-esteem and life      satisfaction), and public displays of adaptive behaviours (e.g. celebrate the      team's victory into the streets), whereas obsessive passion was predictive of      maladaptive affective life (e.g. hating opposing teams' fans) and behaviours      (e.g. mocking opposing teams' fans). Finally, Study 3 examined the role of      obsessive passion as a predictor of partner's conflict that in turn undermined      partner's relationship satisfaction. Overall, the present results provided      support for the Dualistic Model of Passion. The conceptual and applied      implications of the findings are discussed.FAU - Vallerand, Robert JAU  - Vallerand RJAD  - Universite du Quebec a Montreal, Montreal, Canada. vallerand.rober_J@uqam.caFAU - Ntoumanis, NikosAU  - Ntoumanis NFAU - Philippe, Frederick LAU  - Philippe FLFAU - Lavigne, Genevieve LAU  - Lavigne GLFAU - Carbonneau, NoemieAU  - Carbonneau NFAU - Bonneville, ArielleAU  - Bonneville AFAU - Lagace-Labonte, CamilleAU  - Lagace-Labonte CFAU - Maliha, GabrielleAU  - Maliha GLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - EnglandTA  - J Sports SciJT  - Journal of sports sciencesJID - 8405364SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Aged, 80 and overMH  - *EuphoriaMH  - *Expressed EmotionMH  - FemaleMH  - *HappinessMH  - HumansMH  - Interpersonal RelationsMH  - MaleMH  - Mental HealthMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Models, PsychologicalMH  - Personal AutonomyMH  - Personal SatisfactionMH  - Pilot ProjectsMH  - Psychological TestsMH  - Soccer/physiology/*psychologyMH  - *Social SupportMH  - Stress, PsychologicalMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2008/09/23 09:00MHDA- 2009/03/05 09:00CRDT- 2008/09/23 09:00AID - 902578823 [pii]AID - 10.1080/02640410802123185 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Sci. 2008 Oct;26(12):1279-93. doi: 10.1080/02640410802123185.PMID- 18769531OWN - NLMSTAT- PublisherDA  - 20090305IS  - 1469-0292 (Print)VI  - 8IP  - 5DP  - 2007 SepTI  - Assessing Autonomy-Supportive Coaching Strategies in Youth Sport.PG  - 671-684AB  - OBJECTIVES: Autonomy support is a component of the motivational climate in youth       sport that may promote youth's internalization of behaviors and attitudes. This      study examined the psychometric properties of the Autonomy-Supportive Coaching      Questionnaire (ASCQ), a measure of two forms of autonomy-supportive coaching      perceived by young athletes. DESIGN: The study design was non-experimental.      METHODS: Over a six-week season, youth (N = 165) participating in a recreational       summer swim league completed measures of perceived coaching behavior (weeks 1 and      5), autonomy-supportive coaching (week 5) and psychological need satisfaction      (weeks 1 and 6). RESULTS: Responses to the ASCQ could be reduced to two      correlated factors representing an "interest in athlete's input" and "praise for       autonomous behavior." These factors exhibited slightly different relations with      perceived coaching behaviors and positively predicted coaching-associated      contrasts in the satisfaction of all three basic psychological needs.      CONCLUSIONS: The ASCQ appears to provide a valid assessment of young athlete's      perceptions of autonomy-supportive coaching. Autonomy-supportive coaching should       be evaluated as a potential source of motivational consequences of coaching and      as a potential moderator of coaching effects on youth internalization.FAU - Conroy, David EAU  - Conroy DEFAU - Coatsworth, J DouglasAU  - Coatsworth JDLA  - ENGGR  - R03 HD042535/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R03 HD042535-02/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLETA  - Psychol Sport ExercJT  - Psychology of sport and exerciseJID - 101088724PMC - PMC2390874MID - NIHMS28788EDAT- 2008/09/05 09:00MHDA- 2008/09/05 09:00CRDT- 2008/09/05 09:00AID - 10.1016/j.psychsport.2006.12.001 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Psychol Sport Exerc. 2007 Sep;8(5):671-684.PMID- 18757625OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20080901DCOM- 20081124IS  - 1473-4257 (Electronic)IS  - 0306-6800 (Linking)VI  - 34IP  - 9DP  - 2008 SepTI  - Contractual obligations and the sharing of confidential health information in      sport.PG  - e6LID - 10.1136/jme.2008.024794 [doi]AB  - As an employee, a sports doctor has obligations to their employer, but also      professional and widely accepted obligations of a doctor to the patient (in this       case the individual team member). The conflict is evident when sports doctors are      asked by an athlete to keep personal health information confidential from the      coach and team management, and yet both doctor and athlete have employment      contracts specifying that such information shall be shared. Recent research in      New Zealand shows that despite the presence of an employment contract, there      appears to be a wide range of behaviours among sports doctors when an athlete      requests that information about them be kept from team management. Many seem      willing to honour requests to keep health information about the athlete      confidential, thereby being in breach of the employment contract, while others      insist on informing team management against the wishes of the athlete. There are       a number of potential solutions to this dilemma from forcing doctors to meet      their contractual obligations, to limiting the expectations of the employment      contract. This paper suggests that at times it may be appropriate to do both,      making the position of the doctor clearer and supporting the ability of this      group to resist pressure by coaches and management through having a robust code      of ethics.FAU - Anderson, LAU  - Anderson LAD  - Bioethics Centre, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.      lynley.anderson@stonebow.otago.ac.nzLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - EnglandTA  - J Med EthicsJT  - Journal of medical ethicsJID - 7513619SB  - ESB  - IMMH  - Athletic Injuries/therapyMH  - Confidentiality/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudenceMH  - *Conflict of InterestMH  - *EmploymentMH  - HumansMH  - New ZealandMH  - Physician-Patient Relations/*ethicsMH  - Sports Medicine/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudenceEDAT- 2008/09/02 09:00MHDA- 2008/12/17 09:00CRDT- 2008/09/02 09:00AID - 34/9/e6 [pii]AID - 10.1136/jme.2008.024794 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Med Ethics. 2008 Sep;34(9):e6. doi: 10.1136/jme.2008.024794.PMID- 18684323OWN - NLMSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINEDA  - 20080825DCOM- 20100628IS  - 1477-7517 (Electronic)IS  - 1477-7517 (Linking)VI  - 5DP  - 2008TI  - Virtual harm reduction efforts for Internet gambling: effects of deposit limits      on actual Internet sports gambling behavior.PG  - 27LID - 10.1186/1477-7517-5-27 [doi]AB  - BACKGROUND: In an attempt to reduce harm related to gambling problems, an      Internet sports betting service provider, bwin Interactive Entertainment, AG      (bwin), imposes limits on the amount of money that users can deposit into their      online gambling accounts. We examined the effects of these limits on gambling      behavior. METHODS: We compared (1) gambling behavior of those who exceeded      deposit limits with those who did not, and (2) gambling behavior before and after      exceeding deposit limits. We analyzed 2 years of the actual sports gambling      behavior records of 47000 subscribers to bwin. RESULTS: Only 160 (0.3%) exceeded       deposit limits at least once. Gamblers who exceeded deposit limits evidenced      higher average number of bets per active betting day and higher average size of      bets than gamblers who did not exceed deposit limits. Comparing the gambling      behavior before and after exceeding deposit limits revealed slightly more      unfavorable gambling behavior after exceeding deposit limits. CONCLUSION: Our      findings indicate that Internet gamblers who exceed deposit limits constitute a      group of bettors willing to take high risks; yet, surprisingly, they appear to do      this rather successfully because their percentage of losses is lower than others       in the sample. However, some of these gamblers exhibit some poor outcomes.      Deposit limits might be necessary harm reduction measures to prevent the loss of       extremely large amounts of money and cases of bankruptcy.

The      objective of this study was to obtain pilot data on whether youth self-report      deserves further study. We followed 67 recreational and elite soccer players aged      11-17 for one season and compared responses of injured players with those of      their parents/coaches. We defined our main outcome of discordance as any      disagreement in responses between the youth, parent and coach (triad). When one      person didn't know the answer, we categorised the responses as "concordance" if      the other two members agreed. We omitted data when two people responded "Don't      Know". Of 10 injuries that could be analysed, 29/30 interviews occurred within 21      days. For factual questions analysed, there was 100% concordance for the type and      side of injury, and place where the injury occurred. There were 1-2 discordant      triads for each of time of day, activity during injury and specific body part      injured. There were greater discordances for date of injury, first-aid treatment,      and opinions concerning underlying reasons for the injury. Interview-report by      youth themselves should be explored as a possible low cost method of documenting       youth sport injuries.FAU - Shrier, IanAU  - Shrier IAD  - Centre for Clinical Epidemiology and Community Studies, Lady Davis Institute for       Medical Research, the Department of Family Medicine, SMBD-Jewish General      Hospital, Montreal, Canada. ian.shrier@mcgill.caFAU - Feldman, DebbieAU  - Feldman DFAU - Akakpo, HuguetteAU  - Akakpo HFAU - Mazer, BarbaraAU  - Mazer BFAU - Goulet, ClaudeAU  - Goulet CFAU - Khelia, ImenAU  - Khelia IFAU - Meeuwisse, WillemAU  - Meeuwisse WFAU - Swaine, BonnieAU  - Swaine BLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20080724PL  - AustraliaTA  - J Sci Med SportJT  - Journal of science and medicine in sport / Sports Medicine AustraliaJID - 9812598SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - *Attitude to HealthMH  - ChildMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - IncidenceMH  - Interviews as TopicMH  - MaleMH  - *ParentsMH  - Pilot ProjectsMH  - QuebecMH  - Reproducibility of ResultsMH  - *Self DisclosureMH  - Soccer/*injuriesEDAT- 2008/07/29 09:00MHDA- 2010/02/06 06:00CRDT- 2008/07/29 09:00PHST- 2008/03/12 [received]PHST- 2008/05/27 [revised]PHST- 2008/06/02 [accepted]PHST- 2008/07/24 [aheadofprint]AID - S1440-2440(08)00112-6 [pii]AID - 10.1016/j.jsams.2008.06.001 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sci Med Sport. 2009 Nov;12(6):633-6. doi: 10.1016/j.jsams.2008.06.001.

These benefits can      extend beyond physical health to include other positive impacts relating to      mental health and personal development. The sport and recreation sector is viewed      as a priority area for increasing rates of physical activity. Participation rates      in organised sport have been shown to be lower in females and to decline with      age, and are reduced in lower socio-economic and minority groups including people      from non-English speaking and Indigenous backgrounds. It is important to      determine the most effective interventions that sporting organisations can use to      increase people's participation. OBJECTIVES: To update a review of all controlled      studies evaluating interventions implemented through sporting organisations to      increase participation. SEARCH STRATEGY: We updated the original (2004) searches       in May 2007. We searched: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials      (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 2 2007); MEDLINE and MEDLINE In-Process and      Other Non-Indexed Citations (2004 to Week 3 April 2007); EMBASE (2004 to Week 17       2007); PsyclNFO (2004 to April Week 1 2007); CINAHL (2004 to Week 1 May 2007);      SPORTDiscus (2004 to April 2007); Sociological Abstracts (2004 to 2007);      Dissertation Abstracts (2004 to May 2007), and a number of freely-available      online health promotion and sports-related databases. We used the internet      extensively to search for studies and locate information generated by sporting      bodies throughout the world. SELECTION CRITERIA: Controlled studies evaluating      any intervention designed to increase active and/ or non-active participation in       sport by people of all ages. Interventions could include: mass media campaigns;      information or education sessions; management or organisational change      strategies; policy changes, for example to improve the socio-cultural environment      to encourage people of specific age, gender or ethnicity to participate; changes       to traditional or existing programs, for example club or association-initiated      rule modification programs; provision of activities beyond traditional or      existing programs, for example 'Come and Try' initiatives (teaser or taster      programs); skill improvement programs; volunteer encouragement programs.      Uncontrolled studies which met other inclusion criteria were to be reported in an      annex to the review. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We assessed whether identified      citations met the inclusion criteria. Two review authors independently inspected       abstracts (NP, RA). We obtained full papers where necessary. As we located no      controlled evaluation studies, we did not undertake data collection or analysis.       We found no uncontrolled studies meeting other inclusion criteria, and therefore       present no annex to the review. MAIN RESULTS: Despite a thorough review of the      published and unpublished literature, we found no rigorous studies evaluating the      effects of interventions organised through sporting organisations to increase      participation in sport. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is an absence of high quality      evidence to support interventions designed and delivered by sporting      organisations to increase participation in sport. Interventions funded and      conducted in this area must be linked to a rigorous evaluation strategy in order       to examine overall effectiveness, socio-demographic differentials in      participation and cost-effectiveness of these strategies.FAU - Priest, NaomiAU  - Priest NAD  - McCaughey Centre, Melbourne School of Population Health, University of Melbourne,      5/207 Bouverie St, Parkville, VIC, Australia, 3052. npriest@unimelb.edu.auFAU - Armstrong, RebeccaAU  - Armstrong RFAU - Doyle, JodieAU  - Doyle JFAU - Waters, ElizabethAU  - Waters ELA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20080716PL  - EnglandTA  - Cochrane Database Syst RevJT  - The Cochrane database of systematic reviewsJID - 100909747SB  - IMUOF - Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2005;(2):CD004812.

This study targeted cheerleading       coaches as potential change agents by training them to recognize the symptoms of       eating disorders and reduce the pressures for thinness among their squads.      Cheerleading coaches at national or regional conferences attended an intervention      workshop or a control workshop. Coaches who attended the intervention workshop      received information regarding negative coaching behaviors, the symptoms of      eating disorders, and ways to manage athletes with eating disorders. In addition,      intervention coaches were encouraged to participate in six intervention      strategies (e.g., reading materials, video, parent handouts, etc.) after      attending the workshop. Eight months following the workshop, the coaches      completed an assessment battery designed to test the effectiveness of the entire       intervention. The results indicated that the intervention was successful in      producing behavior changes in coaches. However, the intervention was less      successful in producing long-term change in knowledge about eating disorders.      These findings imply that interventions can be implemented by important adult      figures (e.g., coaches, teachers) but the overall effectiveness of these      interventions must be enhanced in order to have a significant and long-term      impact.FAU - Whisenhunt, B LAU  - Whisenhunt BLAD  - Psychology Department, Missouri State University, Springfield, MO 65897, USA.      bwhisenhunt@missouristate. eduFAU - Williamson, D AAU  - Williamson DAFAU - Drab-Hudson, D LAU  - Drab-Hudson DLFAU - Walden, HAU  - Walden HLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Randomized Controlled TrialPL  - ItalyTA  - Eat Weight DisordJT  - Eating and weight disorders : EWDJID - 9707113SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - *AwarenessMH  - Body ImageMH  - *Body WeightMH  - Eating Disorders/diagnosisMH  - EducationMH  - FemaleMH  - Follow-Up StudiesMH  - Health EducationMH  - Health Knowledge, Attitudes, PracticeMH  - HumansMH  - *Physical Education and TrainingMH  - Program EvaluationMH  - Referral and ConsultationMH  - Sports/*psychologyMH  - Thinness/*psychologyEDAT- 2008/07/10 09:00MHDA- 2008/10/07 09:00CRDT- 2008/07/10 09:00AID - 4706 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Eat Weight Disord. 2008 Jun;13(2):102-10.PMID- 18602998OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20080902DCOM- 20090325LR  - 20150217IS  - 1095-9130 (Electronic)IS  - 1046-2023 (Linking)VI  - 45IP  - 4DP  - 2008 AugTI  - Neuroimaging coordination dynamics in the sport sciences.PG  - 325-35LID - 10.1016/j.ymeth.2008.06.001 [doi]AB  - Key methodological issues for designing, analyzing, and interpreting neuroimaging      experiments are presented from the perspective of the framework of Coordination      Dynamics. To this end, a brief overview of Coordination Dynamics is introduced,      including the main concepts of control parameters and collective variables,      theoretical modeling, novel experimental paradigms, and cardinal empirical      findings. Basic conceptual and methodological issues for the design and      implementation of coordination experiments in the context of neuroimaging are      discussed. The paper concludes with a presentation of neuroimaging findings      central to understanding the neural basis of coordination and addresses their      relevance for the sport sciences. The latter include but are not restricted to      learning and practice-related issues, the role of mental imagery, and the      recovery of function following brain injury.FAU - Jantzen, Kelly JAU  - Jantzen KJAD  - Human Cognition and Neural Dynamics Laboratory, Western Washington University,      Bellingham, Washington, USA. kelly.jantzen@wwu.eduFAU - Oullier, OlivierAU  - Oullier OFAU - Scott Kelso, J AAU  - Scott Kelso JALA  - engGR  - MH42900/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - NS48229/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 MH042900/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 MH042900-06/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 MH042900-19A2/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 MH080838/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 NS048229/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 NS048229-01A1/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - R01 NS048229-04/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPT  - Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.PT  - ReviewDEP - 20080709PL  - United StatesTA  - MethodsJT  - Methods (San Diego, Calif.)JID - 9426302SB  - IMMH  - Athletic Performance/*physiologyMH  - Brain/physiologyMH  - Diagnostic Imaging/methodsMH  - HumansMH  - Psychomotor Performance/*physiologyMH  - Sports/physiologyMH  - Sports Medicine/*methodsRF  - 136PMC - PMC2570103MID - NIHMS67193OID - NLM: NIHMS67193OID - NLM: PMC2570103EDAT- 2008/07/08 09:00MHDA- 2009/03/26 09:00CRDT- 2008/07/08 09:00PHST- 2008/04/15 [received]PHST- 2008/05/29 [revised]PHST- 2008/06/04 [accepted]PHST- 2008/07/09 [aheadofprint]AID - S1046-2023(08)00088-1 [pii]AID - 10.1016/j.ymeth.2008.06.001 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Methods. 2008 Aug;45(4):325-35. doi: 10.1016/j.ymeth.2008.06.001.

METHODS: The study population comprised      1124 12-year-old children and their parents. Parents' PA was assessed using the      Baecke questionnaire and a question about sport participation. Children's PA was       assessed by questions about participation in sport and vigorous activities. The      children's self-esteem and athletic competence were assessed by Harter's      Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents. RESULTS: Parents' PA was strongly      associated with their children's PA. With 2 active parents, the odds ratio for      their children to participate in sport was 3.9 (95% CI = 2.2-6.9, girls) and 8.8       (95% CI = 4.3-18.0, boys) compared with having inactive parents. Athletic      competence partly mediated these associations. CONCLUSIONS: The family is an      important target for interventions to increase PA among children, and it might be      important to consider ways to reinforce children's athletic competence.FAU - Eriksson, MaritAU  - Eriksson MAD  - Child and Adolescent Public Health Epidemiology Group, Dept of Public Health      Sciences, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.FAU - Nordqvist, TobiasAU  - Nordqvist TFAU - Rasmussen, FinnAU  - Rasmussen FLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - United StatesTA  - J Phys Act HealthJT  - Journal of physical activity & healthJID - 101189457SB  - IMMH  - ChildMH  - FemaleMH  - *Health BehaviorMH  - Health StatusMH  - Health SurveysMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - *Mental CompetencyMH  - *Motor ActivityMH  - ObesityMH  - OverweightMH  - *Parent-Child RelationsMH  - PrevalenceMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - *Self ConceptMH  - *SportsEDAT- 2008/06/27 09:00MHDA- 2008/08/16 09:00CRDT- 2008/06/27 09:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Phys Act Health. 2008 May;5(3):359-73.PMID- 18569556OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20080623DCOM- 20081118IS  - 0264-0414 (Print)IS  - 0264-0414 (Linking)VI  - 26IP  - 9DP  - 2008 JulTI  - Stressors in elite sport: a coach perspective.PG  - 905-18LID - 10.1080/02640410801885933 [doi]AB  - We examined the varying performance and organizational stressors experienced by      coaches who operate with elite athletes.

Participants were competitive female gymnasts (aged 11 to 18 years), parents, and      coaches from 7 gymnastic clubs across Ontario, Canada. Four of the seven clubs      were randomized to receive the 3-month intervention program (IG) aimed at      increasing awareness and positive climate change of body image pressures for      athletes in their clubs. Three clubs were randomized to the control group (CG). A      total of 62 female gymnasts (IG n = 31; CG n = 31) completed self-report      questionnaires examining perceptions of pressure to be thin within their sports      clubs, self-efficacy over dieting pressures, awareness and internalization of      societal pressure to be thin, body esteem, and eating attitudes and behaviours      before and following the intervention. A total of 32 mothers (IG n = 24; CG n =      8) completed measures examining their perceptions of their daughter's pressure to      be thin, awareness and internalization of societal pressures to be thin,      daughter's self-efficacy over dieting pressures, in addition to mothers' beliefs       regarding thinness and success for women in society, before and following the      intervention. The findings revealed that participation in the BodySense program      resulted in athletes perceiving a reduction in pressure from their sports clubs      to be thin, though no changes were found in body esteem, the EAT, or the SATAQ.      No significant change was observed over time on mothers' measures.

Their       incidence is greater in women, frequently appearing a low self-esteem, a      distorted body image in which the body is perceived with an excess of weight,      inefficiency, perfectionism and a sense of control loss, with compensatory      attempts exerted through food manipulation and the use of inadequate methods of      control weight. Frequently, they are associated in female athletes to      irregularities of the menstrual cycle, reduction of the bone mineral density and       osteoporosis, giving rise to so-called female athlete triad. Cardiovascular      problems, a greater incidence of fractures, and muscular power and resistance      losses which impair performance, can also develop. Between the risk for their      appearance are attempts to lose weight, often by recommendation of the coach,      increases of training loads associated to weight losses, characteristics of the      personality that take to excessive preoccupation by body image, or injuries and      traumatisms. Treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach, with participation       of physicians, psychologists/psychiatrists, nutricionists, coaches and family,      being specially important the emphasis on preventive measures.FAU - Marquez, SAU  - Marquez SAD  - Departamento de Educacion Fisica y Deportiva, Instituto de Biomedicina,      Universidad de Leon, Leon, Espana. sara.marquez@unileon.esLA  - spaPT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewTT  - Trastornos alimentarios en el deporte: factores de riesgo, consecuencias sobre la      salud, tratamiento y prevencion.PL  - SpainTA  - Nutr HospJT  - Nutricion hospitalariaJID - 9100365SB  - IMMH  - *Eating Disorders/complications/etiology/prevention & control/therapyMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - *SportsRF  - 74EDAT- 2008/06/19 09:00MHDA- 2008/10/23 09:00CRDT- 2008/06/19 09:00PHST- 2008/02/26 [received]PHST- 2008/03/18 [accepted]AID - S0212-16112008000300003 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Nutr Hosp. 2008 May-Jun;23(3):183-90.PMID- 18550984OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20080613DCOM- 20080904LR  - 20131121IS  - 1533-4287 (Electronic)IS  - 1064-8011 (Linking)VI  - 22IP  - 2DP  - 2008 MarTI  - The triple-120 meter shuttle test: a sport-specific test for assessing anaerobic       endurance fitness in rugby league players.PG  - 633-9LID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e31816600e9 [doi]AB  - The aim of this study was to design a simple field test to measure the anaerobic       endurance fitness of rugby league players, which is an important fitness quality       in the game of rugby league. Twelve amateur football players with a mean (+/-SD)       age of 21.5 years (+/-2.2) volunteered to participate in the study. The subjects       completed 1 trial of the Wingate 60-second (W60) cycle test and 2 trials of the      new Triple-120 meter shuttle (T120S) test. All trials were completed 4 days      apart. The validity of the T120S was determined by comparing physiological      responses (heart rate and blood lactate) and rating of perceived exertion to the       all-out W60 cycle test. The results indicate there is a significant relationship       between maximum heart rate (r = 0.63 and 0.71) for the 2 trials of the T120S and       the W60 cycle test. There was no significant relationship between the 2 trials      and the W60 cycle test for post 3 minute lactate (r = 0.112 and 0.101) and rating      of perceived exertion (r = 0.94 and 0.161). However, the T120S test elicited      greater mean values for these measures than the W60 cycle test. The results      indicate that the T120S is a valid test of anaerobic endurance and represents a      sports specific test of this quality that may provide useful information for      players and coaches involved in the sport of rugby league.FAU - Holloway, Kate MAU  - Holloway KMAD  - Department of Exercise Science and Sport Management, Southern Cross University,      Lismore, Australia.FAU - Meir, Rudi AAU  - Meir RAFAU - Brooks, Lyndon OAU  - Brooks LOFAU - Phillips, Cameron JAU  - Phillips CJLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Strength Cond ResJT  - Journal of strength and conditioning research / National Strength & Conditioning       AssociationJID - 9415084RN  - 33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Anaerobic Threshold/*physiologyMH  - Exercise Test/*methodsMH  - Football/*physiologyMH  - Heart Rate/physiologyMH  - HumansMH  - Lactic Acid/bloodMH  - MaleMH  - Physical Endurance/*physiologyMH  - Physical Fitness/*physiologyMH  - Reproducibility of ResultsEDAT- 2008/06/14 09:00MHDA- 2008/09/05 09:00CRDT- 2008/06/14 09:00AID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e31816600e9 [doi]AID - 00124278-200803000-00042 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - J Strength Cond Res. 2008 Mar;22(2):633-9. doi: 10.1519/JSC.0b013e31816600e9.PMID- 18550947OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20080613DCOM- 20080904IS  - 1533-4287 (Electronic)IS  - 1064-8011 (Linking)VI  - 22IP  - 2DP  - 2008 MarTI  - Sport-specific characteristics of trunk muscles in collegiate wrestlers and      judokas.PG  - 350-8LID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181635d25 [doi]AB  - This study evaluated the sport-specific characteristics of the cross-sectional      areas (CSAs) of trunk muscles and trunk muscle strength in wrestlers and judokas.      We also examined whether their trunk muscles and muscle strength depended on      athletic performance levels in each sport. The subjects comprised 14 male      collegiate wrestlers and 14 judokas. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to      assess the trunk muscle CSAs at the L3-4 level parallel to the lumbar disc space.      A Biodex System3 was used to measure isokinetic trunk flexor and extensor muscle       strength of peak torque, work, average torque, and average power. The absolute      and relative CSAs of the trunk muscles in the wrestlers and judokas were      significantly different (rectus abdominis: wrestling > judo, P < 0.05; obliques:       wrestling < judo, P < 0.05; quadratus lumborum: wrestling < judo, P < 0.01). We      confirmed that the absolute and relative trunk extensor and flexor strength of      peak torque, work, and average torque were significantly higher in the collegiate      wrestlers than in judokas. On athletic performance, the tendency of the CSAs and       muscular strength of trunk muscles was not consistent with athletic performance      levels in each sport. Our findings indicated that the sport-specific      characteristics of the CSAs of the trunk muscles and trunk muscle strength      obviously differed between the 2 similar sports. Athletes should practice the      sport-specific training of trunk muscles and develop sport specificity in their      sports. Particularly, wrestlers have to train in trunk flexion and extension      motions, and judokas need to strengthen trunk rotation and lateral flexion      motions. This information will be available for athletes as well as strength and       technical training coaches in wrestling, judo, and the other sports.FAU - Iwai, KazunoriAU  - Iwai KAD  - Graduate School of Health and Sport Science, Nippon Sport Science University,      Tokyo, Japan. iwai@hiroshima-cmt.ac.jpFAU - Okada, TakashiAU  - Okada TFAU - Nakazato, KoichiAU  - Nakazato KFAU - Fujimoto, HideoAU  - Fujimoto HFAU - Yamamoto, YosukeAU  - Yamamoto YFAU - Nakajima, HiroyukiAU  - Nakajima HLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - United StatesTA  - J Strength Cond ResJT  - Journal of strength and conditioning research / National Strength & Conditioning       AssociationJID - 9415084SB  - IMMH  - Abdominal Muscles/*anatomy & histology/*physiologyMH  - AdultMH  - Anatomy, Cross-SectionalMH  - Athletic Performance/physiologyMH  - HumansMH  - Magnetic Resonance ImagingMH  - MaleMH  - Martial Arts/*physiologyMH  - Muscle Strength/*physiologyMH  - Wrestling/*physiologyEDAT- 2008/06/14 09:00MHDA- 2008/09/05 09:00CRDT- 2008/06/14 09:00AID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181635d25 [doi]AID - 00124278-200803000-00005 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - J Strength Cond Res. 2008 Mar;22(2):350-8. doi: 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181635d25.PMID- 18523575OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20080604DCOM- 20080923LR  - 20140903IS  - 1938-162X (Electronic)IS  - 1062-6050 (Linking)VI  - 43IP  - 3DP  - 2008 May-JunTI  - Athletic trainers' and physical therapists' perceptions of the effectiveness of      psychological skills within sport injury rehabilitation programs.PG  - 258-64LID - 10.4085/1062-6050-43.3.258 [doi]AB  - CONTEXT: Psychological skills are alleged to augment sport-injury rehabilitation;      however, implementation of mental imagery within rehabilitation programs is      limited. OBJECTIVE: To examine attitudes of athletic trainers (ATs) and physical       therapists (PTs) on the effectiveness of mental imagery, goal setting, and      positive self-talk to improve rehabilitation adherence and recovery speed of      injured athletes. DESIGN: The ATs and PTs were contacted via electronic or      physical mailings to complete a single administration survey that measured their       beliefs about the effectiveness of psychological skills for increasing adherence       and recovery speed of injured athletes undergoing rehabilitation. SETTING:      Professional member databases of the National Athletic Trainers' Association and       the American Physical Therapy Association. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Of the      1000 ATs and 1000 PTs who were selected randomly, 309 ATs (age = 34.18 +/- 8.32      years, years in profession = 10.67 +/- 7.34) and 356 PTs (age = 38.58 +/- 7.51      years, years in profession = 13.18 +/- 6.17) responded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S):       The Attitudes About Imagery (AAI) survey measures attitudes about psychological      skills for enhancing adherence and recovery speed of injured athletes. The AAI      includes demographic questions and 15 items on a 7-point Likert scale measuring      attitudes about the effectiveness of mental imagery, self-talk, goal setting, and      pain control on rehabilitation adherence and recovery speed of injured athletes.       Test-retest reliability ranged from .60 to .84 and Cronbach alphas ranged from      .65 to .90. We calculated 1-way analyses of variance to determine whether      differences existed in attitudes as a result of the professionals' education,      training experience, and interest. RESULTS: Mean differences were found on      attitudes about effectiveness of psychological skills for those who reported      formal training and those who reported interest in receiving formal training (P <      .05).

Such genetically-endowed      athletes must also receive optimal training to increase physical power, enhance      mental strength, and provide a mechanical advantage. However, athletes often      attempt to go beyond training and use substances and techniques, often referred      to as ergogenics, in attempts to gain a competitive advantage. Pharmacological      agents, such as anabolic steroids and amphetamines, have been used in the past,      but such practices by athletes have led to the establishment of anti-doping      legislation and effective testing protocols to help deter their use. Thus, many      athletes have turned to various dietary strategies, including the use of various       dietary supplements (sports supplements), which they presume to be effective,      safe and legal.FAU - Williams, Melvin HAU  - Williams MHAD  - Department of Exercise Science, Old Dominion University. profrunner@aol.com.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20041231PL  - United StatesTA  - J Int Soc Sports NutrJT  - Journal of the International Society of Sports NutritionJID - 101234168PMC - PMC2129136OID - NLM: PMC2129136EDAT- 2008/05/24 09:00MHDA- 2008/05/24 09:01CRDT- 2008/05/24 09:00PHST- 2004/11/09 [received]PHST- 2004/11/22 [accepted]PHST- 2004/12/31 [aheadofprint]AID - 1550-2783-1-2-1 [pii]AID - 10.1186/1550-2783-1-2-1 [doi]PST - epublishSO  - J Int Soc Sports Nutr. 2004 Dec 31;1:1-6. doi: 10.1186/1550-2783-1-2-1.PMID- 18461216OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20080507DCOM- 20081209IS  - 0304-4602 (Print)IS  - 0304-4602 (Linking)VI  - 37IP  - 4DP  - 2008 AprTI  - Common lower limb sport-related overuse injuries in young athletes.PG  - 315-9AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sports injuries in children and adolescent present a unique      challenge to the physician. They are often seen for clinical conditions unique to      their age group. This paper highlights the epidemiological aspect of      sports-related overuse injuries in this age group. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This      retrospective study reviewed all the paediatric patients diagnosed with overuses       injuries during a 5 years and 7 months period. The overuse injuries were anterior      superior iliac spine avulsion fracture, Osgood-Schlatter disease,      Sinding-Larson-Johansson disease, osteochondritis dissecan and Sever's disease.      We reviewed the literature and attempted to give an overview for each condition      and the anatomical differences that contributed to their occurrence in this age      group. RESULTS: A total of 506 cases of the overuse injuries were seen during the      study period. Seventy-three per cent were male patients. The knee joint was the      commonest affected joint while the hip was the least affected joint. The mean age      at diagnosis was younger in female compared to male for all conditions except in       Sinding-Larson Johansson syndrome. Female was diagnosed at a mean age of 11.7      years while male at 10.8 years. Osgood-Schlatter disease was the commonest among       the overuse injuries. There was no discernible racial predilection for these      conditions except in the patients with anterior superior iliac spine avulsion.      CONCLUSIONS: Overuse injuries are not uncommon in children and adolescent. An      adequate understanding of the anatomy of the sports the children participated in       as well as the anatomical differences between adult and children may assist the      primary care providers better meet parents' and coaches' expectations.FAU - Lau, Leok LimAU  - Lau LLAD  - Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, National University Hospital, Singapore.FAU - Mahadev, ArjandasAU  - Mahadev AFAU - Hui, James HpAU  - Hui JHLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - SingaporeTA  - Ann Acad Med SingaporeJT  - Annals of the Academy of Medicine, SingaporeJID - 7503289SB  - IMMH  - Athletic Injuries/classification/*epidemiology/physiopathologyMH  - ChildMH  - Cumulative Trauma Disorders/classification/*epidemiology/physiopathologyMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - Lower Extremity/*injuriesMH  - MaleMH  - Medical AuditMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Singapore/epidemiologyEDAT- 2008/05/08 09:00MHDA- 2008/12/17 09:00CRDT- 2008/05/08 09:00PST - ppublishSO  - Ann Acad Med Singapore. 2008 Apr;37(4):315-9.PMID- 18461208OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20080507DCOM- 20081209LR  - 20140730IS  - 0304-4602 (Print)IS  - 0304-4602 (Linking)VI  - 37IP  - 4DP  - 2008 AprTI  - Dehydration rates and rehydration efficacy of water and sports drink during one      hour of moderate intensity exercise in well-trained flatwater kayakers.PG  - 261-5AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study is to investigate the amount of water loss      and percentage dehydration experienced during 1 hour of paddling on the kayak      ergometer so as to help coaches and athletes tailor a suitable and adequate      rehydration regime. Also, rehydration efficacy between water and a well      established, commercially available sports drink (Gatorade, Quaker Oats company,       USA) was investigated in this cross-over study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten      national flatwater kayakers were monitored in a controlled setting while paddling      the kayak ergometer for 1 hour at an intensity sustainable for long distance      marathon. They rehydrated themselves ad libitum with provided beverage. Post-void      towel-dried body mass was measured before and after the exercise with percentage       dehydration calculated. Body core temperature (tympanic temperatures), ratings of      perceived exertion and thirst index were monitored every 15 minutes. The amount      of fluid consumed, urine output and urine specific gravity were obtained after      exercise. RESULTS: The results [mean +/- standard deviation (SD)] showed that      kayakers underwent 1.10 +/- 0.52% dehydration while rehydrating with water as      compared to 0.72 +/- 0.38% while rehydrating with Gatorade. Also, athletes on      water rehydration had higher rating of perceived exertion (RPE) at the 30th and      60th minute mark of the exercise. Overall, athletes undergoing water rehydration       lost significantly more body mass (0.70 +/- 0.39 kg) as compared to rehydrating      with Gatorade (0.46 +/- 0.27). CONCLUSION: Although the hydration efficacy of      Gatorade proved superior to that of water, the athletes' hydration habits with      either fluids did not provide adequate hydration.

A qualitative (grounded theory) methodology, using focus groups,      investigated the experiences of people with mental health problems, who had      successfully participated in exercise as part of their treatment. The aim of this      study was to investigate the experiences of service users who had successfully      participated in sports therapy as part of their treatment. One of the researchers      is also a service user who has participated in sports therapy and these      experiences provided an insight into the research, especially in the design of      the interview schedule, data collection (empathy with participants), and in the      interpretation of the data. The dual role of service user and researcher is      commended in contemporary mental health research and as such makes this study      unique. A conceptual model is presented that explains the participants'      subjective experiences, opinions, and perceptions of the role exercise has in      their treatment, and their perceived outcomes from participation. The findings      support sports therapy as an acceptable and beneficial adjunct to usual treatment      for some people with mental health problems within the community, but that      problems exist regarding knowledge and understanding of the theory underpinning      its use.FAU - Crone, DianeAU  - Crone DAD  - Faculty of Sport, Health and Social Care, University of Gloucestershire, Oxstalls      Campus, Gloucester, UK. dcrone@glos.ac.ukFAU - Guy, HelenAU  - Guy HLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - AustraliaTA  - Int J Ment Health NursJT  - International journal of mental health nursingJID - 101140527SB  - NMH  - *Adaptation, PsychologicalMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - *Attitude to HealthMH  - EnglandMH  - *Exercise Therapy/methodsMH  - FemaleMH  - Focus GroupsMH  - Health StatusMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Mental Disorders/prevention & control/*psychologyMH  - Mental HealthMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Models, PsychologicalMH  - MotivationMH  - Nursing Methodology ResearchMH  - Qualitative ResearchMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Research DesignMH  - Social SupportMH  - Sports/*psychologyEDAT- 2008/05/08 09:00MHDA- 2008/08/15 09:00CRDT- 2008/05/08 09:00AID - INM529 [pii]AID - 10.1111/j.1447-0349.2008.00529.x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Int J Ment Health Nurs. 2008 Jun;17(3):197-207. doi:      10.1111/j.1447-0349.2008.00529.x.PMID- 18438212OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20080606DCOM- 20080807LR  - 20131121IS  - 1533-4287 (Electronic)IS  - 1064-8011 (Linking)VI  - 22IP  - 3DP  - 2008 MayTI  - Caffeine use in sports: considerations for the athlete.PG  - 978-86LID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181660cec [doi]AB  - The ergogenic effects of caffeine on athletic performance have been shown in many      studies, and its broad range of metabolic, hormonal, and physiologic effects has       been recorded, as this review of the literature shows. However, few caffeine      studies have been published to include cognitive and physiologic considerations      for the athlete. The following practical recommendations consider the global      effects of caffeine on the body: Lower doses can be as effective as higher doses       during exercise performance without any negative coincidence; after a period of      cessation, restarting caffeine intake at a low amount before performance can      provide the same ergogenic effects as acute intake; caffeine can be taken      gradually at low doses to avoid tolerance during the course of 3 or 4 days, just       before intense training to sustain exercise intensity; and caffeine can improve      cognitive aspects of performance, such as concentration, when an athlete has not       slept well. Athletes and coaches also must consider how a person's body size,      age, gender, previous use, level of tolerance, and the dose itself all influence       the ergogenic effects of caffeine on sports performance.FAU - Sokmen, BulentAU  - Sokmen BAD  - Human Performance Laboratory, Department of Kinesiology, University of      Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut, USA. bsokmen@exchange.fullerton.eduFAU - Armstrong, Lawrence EAU  - Armstrong LEFAU - Kraemer, William JAU  - Kraemer WJFAU - Casa, Douglas JAU  - Casa DJFAU - Dias, Joao CAU  - Dias JCFAU - Judelson, Daniel AAU  - Judelson DAFAU - Maresh, Carl MAU  - Maresh CMLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - J Strength Cond ResJT  - Journal of strength and conditioning research / National Strength & Conditioning       AssociationJID - 9415084RN  - 3G6A5W338E (Caffeine)SB  - IMMH  - *Athletic PerformanceMH  - Caffeine/*administration & dosage/adverse effectsMH  - Central Nervous System/drug effectsMH  - Evidence-Based MedicineMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Musculoskeletal System/drug effectsMH  - Physical EnduranceMH  - Psychomotor Performance/*physiologyMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Sensitivity and SpecificityMH  - Sports/*physiologyMH  - Sports MedicineRF  - 67EDAT- 2008/04/29 09:00MHDA- 2008/08/08 09:00CRDT- 2008/04/29 09:00AID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181660cec [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Strength Cond Res. 2008 May;22(3):978-86. doi: 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181660cec.PMID- 18413087OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20080416DCOM- 20080903IS  - 0214-9915 (Print)IS  - 0214-9915 (Linking)VI  - 20IP  - 2DP  - 2008 MayTI  - [Motivational climate and coaches' communication style predict young soccer      players' commitment].PG  - 254-9AB  - The purpose of this research was to study the role of coaches' communication      style and coach-created motivational climate in young soccer players' enjoyment      and commitment. Four hundred and fifteen young soccer players of high competitive      level in the age range from 14 to 16 completed the following questionnaires: a)      coach-induced perceived motivational climate (PMCSQ-2), b) coaches' behaviour      perception (CBAS-PBS), and c) sport commitment (SCQ). Results showed that      coach-created motivational climate correlated highly with the perception of      coaches' communication style. Moreover, coach-created motivational climate and      communication style significantly determines players' sport commitment and      enjoyment. Discussion focuses on the importance of seeking and training credible       coaches that favours athletes' commitment.FAU - Torregrosa, MiquelAU  - Torregrosa MAD  - Universidad Autonoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, Spain. miquel.torregrosa@uab.esFAU - Sousa, CatarinaAU  - Sousa CFAU - Viladrich, CarmeAU  - Viladrich CFAU - Villamarin, FranciscoAU  - Villamarin FFAU - Cruz, JaumeAU  - Cruz JLA  - spaPT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tTT  - El clima motivacional y el estilo de comunicacion del entrenador como predictores      del compromiso en futbolistas jovenes.PL  - SpainTA  - PsicothemaJT  - PsicothemaJID - 101189384SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - *CommunicationMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - *MentorsMH  - *MotivationMH  - Prospective StudiesMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - *SoccerMH  - *Social EnvironmentEDAT- 2008/04/17 09:00MHDA- 2008/09/04 09:00CRDT- 2008/04/17 09:00PST - ppublishSO  - Psicothema. 2008 May;20(2):254-9.PMID- 18400880OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20091229DCOM- 20100304LR  - 20141120IS  - 1524-8399 (Print)IS  - 1524-8399 (Linking)VI  - 11IP  - 1DP  - 2010 JanTI  - High school coaches' assessments, intentions to use, and use of a concussion      prevention toolkit: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's heads up:      concussion in high school sports.PG  - 34-43LID - 10.1177/1524839907309377 [doi]AB  - This study evaluated school coaches' perceptions, assessments, and use of a      toolkit to prevent and manage concussions among school athletes.

This model has been widely used to implement preventive      measures in response to sports injuries. However, the execution of this model has      been shown to lack validity in determining the success of a preventive measure. A      modified model has therefore been proposed which incorporates additional steps      that enable the inclusion of external factors with a significant effect on the      outcome of a prevention intervention. This expansion of van Mechelen's model      leads to a more global model in which the compliance level and risk-taking      behaviour of the individual and the assessment of efficiency of the stakeholders       have a key influence on the preventive measure. This model gives a better insight      into the different processes in injury prevention that can be used by clinicians,      coaches and managers to decide whether to implement a preventive measure      programme.FAU - Van Tiggelen, DAU  - Van Tiggelen DAD  - Military Hospital of Base Queen Astrid, Belgian Defense, Brussels 1120, Belgium.       damien.vantiggelen@mil.beFAU - Wickes, SAU  - Wickes SFAU - Stevens, VAU  - Stevens VFAU - Roosen, PAU  - Roosen PFAU - Witvrouw, EAU  - Witvrouw ELA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20080409PL  - EnglandTA  - Br J Sports MedJT  - British journal of sports medicineJID - 0432520SB  - IMMH  - Athletic Injuries/*prevention & controlMH  - *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, PracticeMH  - HumansMH  - *Patient ComplianceMH  - Program EvaluationMH  - Risk-TakingRF  - 64EDAT- 2008/04/11 09:00MHDA- 2008/08/30 09:00CRDT- 2008/04/11 09:00PHST- 2008/04/09 [aheadofprint]AID - bjsm.2008.046441 [pii]AID - 10.1136/bjsm.2008.046441 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Br J Sports Med. 2008 Aug;42(8):648-52. doi: 10.1136/bjsm.2008.046441.

Goal setting, positive self-talk, attribution theory, and relaxation or mental      imagery are psychologic interventions that can help injured athletes cope with      psychosocial stressors. Medical professionals should be aware of the potential      influence that psychosocial stressors and psychologic interventions can have on      injury occurrence, injury recovery, and sport performance.FAU - Nippert, Angela HAU  - Nippert AHAD  - Department of Kinesiology and Health Sciences, Concordia University- St. Paul, MN      55104, USA. nippert@csp.eduFAU - Smith, Aynsley MAU  - Smith AMLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Phys Med Rehabil Clin N AmJT  - Physical medicine and rehabilitation clinics of North AmericaJID - 9102787SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Athletic Injuries/epidemiology/*psychology/rehabilitationMH  - Athletic Performance/*psychologyMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Self ConceptMH  - Stress, Psychological/*etiology/psychologyRF  - 70EDAT- 2008/04/09 09:00MHDA- 2008/06/26 09:00CRDT- 2008/04/09 09:00AID - S1047-9651(07)00135-0 [pii]AID - 10.1016/j.pmr.2007.12.003 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Phys Med Rehabil Clin N Am. 2008 May;19(2):399-418, x. doi:      10.1016/j.pmr.2007.12.003.PMID- 18381550OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20080402DCOM- 20080430IS  - 1098-4275 (Electronic)IS  - 0031-4005 (Linking)VI  - 121IP  - 4DP  - 2008 AprTI  - Medical conditions affecting sports participation.PG  - 841-8LID - 10.1542/peds.2008-0080 [doi]AB  - Children and adolescents with medical conditions present special issues with      respect to participation in athletic activities.

Analysis indicated that athletes      scoring higher on the dimensions of wellness also scored significantly higher on       athletic coping skills. Specifically, male athletes who scored higher on wellness      also reported higher scores on coachability, concentration, goal setting/mental      preparation, and peaking under pressure, and female athletes who scored higher on      wellness also reported higher scores in coping with adversity, coachability,      concentration, goal setting/mental preparation, and freedom from worry. Various      dimensions of wellness seem related to better performance by involving the      athletic coping skills of intercollegiate athletes.

One possible explanation for      varied findings is that potentially confounding variables such as level of      participation and type of sport have not been considered. Athletes (108 males and      164 females) from team and individual sports, competing at recreational and      competitive levels, completed the Task and Ego Orientation in Sport      Questionnaire, the Sport Attributional Style Scale, and a demographic      questionnaire. Athletes competing in individual sports had a higher ego      orientation than those from team sports, and females scored higher in task      orientation than males. Individual sport athletes made more internal, stable, and      global, and less externally controllable attributions for positive events, and      more internal attributions for negative events than team sport athletes.      Competitive female athletes made less global attributions for positive events      than did recreational female athletes. This difference was not observed in male      athletes. Competitive individual, but not team, athletes made less global      attributions than recreational individual athletes. The significant interactions       regarding globality suggest that the tradition in sport psychology attribution      research to focus solely on internality, stability, and controllability may be      inadequate. From an applied perspective, sport psychologists and coaches may find      it beneficial to target individual sport athletes and males for interventions      designed to enhance task orientation. Similarly, team sport athletes may be      appropriate as a focus for attribution retraining programs.FAU - Hanrahan, Stephanie JAU  - Hanrahan SJAD  - School of Human Movement Studies, The University of Queensland, Queensland,      Australia. steph@hms.uq.edu.auFAU - Cerin, EsterAU  - Cerin ELA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20080319PL  - AustraliaTA  - J Sci Med SportJT  - Journal of science and medicine in sport / Sports Medicine AustraliaJID - 9812598SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Athletes/*psychologyMH  - AustraliaMH  - ChildMH  - EgoMH  - FemaleMH  - GoalsMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - *Sex FactorsMH  - Sports/*psychologyMH  - *Task Performance and AnalysisMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2008/03/22 09:00MHDA- 2010/01/16 06:00CRDT- 2008/03/22 09:00PHST- 2007/01/22 [received]PHST- 2007/10/17 [revised]PHST- 2008/01/08 [accepted]PHST- 2008/03/19 [aheadofprint]AID - S1440-2440(08)00006-6 [pii]AID - 10.1016/j.jsams.2008.01.005 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sci Med Sport. 2009 Jul;12(4):508-12. doi: 10.1016/j.jsams.2008.01.005.

A      secondary purpose was to determine whether a mastery-based motivational strategy       would enhance the effectiveness of the peer coaches. A quasi field experimental      study was employed in which at-risk children in Dar es Salaam in Tanzania (N=764)      were recruited (average age=13.6 years) and were randomly grouped into two      treatment groups and two control groups. The treatment groups were peer coaches      conducting the AIDS education to the children within sport, one with mastery      coaching strategies and one without. The two control groups were in-school      children, who received traditional AIDS education, and out-of-school children,      who received no education at all. The intervention lasted for 8 weeks. The      results indicated that the intervention using peers in sport was more effective      in transmitting HIV prevention knowledge, cognitions and perceived behaviors than      the control groups. The mastery-based motivational strategies were effective in      influencing some of the variables. Contrary to expectation, the school-based HIV       education was no more effective than the informal education obtained by the      out-of-school children. The use of peer coaches within the EMIMA program was      reliably the most effective means for HIV/AIDS education for these at-risk      children.FAU - Maro, C NAU  - Maro CNAD  - Department of Coachina and Psychology, Norwegian University of Sport Sciences,      Ulleval Stadion, Oslo, Norway.

DESIGN: Descriptive      epidemiology study. SETTING: 100 US high schools. SUBJECTS: Athletes      participating in nine sports: boys' football, soccer, basketball, wrestling, and       baseball plus girls' soccer, volleyball, basketball, and softball. MAIN OUTCOME      MEASURES: Illegal activity-related injuries were analyzed using data from the      2005-06 and 2006-07 National High School Sports-Related Injury Surveillance      Study. RESULTS: Nationally, an estimated 98 066 injuries were directly related to      an action that was ruled illegal activity by a referee/official or disciplinary      committee, giving an injury rate of 0.24 injuries per 1000 athletic      competition-exposures. Boys' and girls' soccer had the highest rates of injuries       related to illegal activity, and girls' volleyball, girls' softball, and boys'      baseball had the lowest. Overall, 6.4% of all high school sports-related injuries      were related to illegal activity, with the highest proportion in girls'      basketball (14.0%), girls' soccer (11.9%), and boys' soccer (11.4%). A greater      proportion of injuries related to illegal activity were to the head/face (32.3%)       and were concussions (25.4%) than injuries not related to illegal activity (13.8%      (injury proportion ratio 2.35; 95% CI 1.82 to 3.04; p<0.001) and 10.9% (injury      proportion ratio 2.35; 95% CI 1.71 to 3.22; p<0.001), respectively). CONCLUSIONS:      Illegal activity is an overlooked risk factor for sports-related injury. Reducing      illegal activity through enhanced enforcement of sports' rules and targeted      education about the dangers of illegal activity for players, coaches, and      referees/officials may reduce sports-related injuries.FAU - Collins, C LAU  - Collins CLAD  - The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Center for Injury      Research and Policy, Columbus, OH 43205, USA.      christy.collins@nationwidechildrens.orgFAU - Fields, S KAU  - Fields SKFAU - Comstock, R DAU  - Comstock RDLA  - engGR  - R49/CE000674-01/CE/NCIPC CDC HHS/United StatesPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.PL  - EnglandTA  - Inj PrevJT  - Injury prevention : journal of the International Society for Child and Adolescent      Injury PreventionJID - 9510056SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Athletic Injuries/epidemiology/*etiology/prevention & controlMH  - Dangerous BehaviorMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - Injury Severity ScoreMH  - MaleMH  - *Risk Reduction BehaviorMH  - Sex DistributionMH  - Sex FactorsMH  - United States/epidemiologyEDAT- 2008/02/05 09:00MHDA- 2008/05/21 09:00CRDT- 2008/02/05 09:00AID - 14/1/34 [pii]AID - 10.1136/ip.2007.017277 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Inj Prev. 2008 Feb;14(1):34-8. doi: 10.1136/ip.2007.017277.PMID- 21509135OWN - NLMSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINEDA  - 20110421DCOM- 20110714LR  - 20110728IS  - 1558-6162 (Print)IS  - 1558-6162 (Linking)VI  - 3IP  - 1DP  - 2008 FebTI  - The role of massage in sports performance and rehabilitation: current evidence      and future direction.PG  - 7-21AB  - BACKGROUND: Massage is a popular treatment choice of athletes, coaches, and      sports physical therapists. Despite its purported benefits and frequent use,      evidence demonstrating its efficacy is scarce. PURPOSE: To identify current      literature relating to sports massage and its role in effecting an athlete's      psychological readiness, in enhancing sports performance, in recovery from      exercise and competition, and in the treatment of sports related musculoskeletal       injuries. METHODS: Electronic databases were used to identify papers relevant to       this review. The following keywords were searched: massage, sports injuries,      athletic injuries, physical therapy, rehabilitation, delayed onset muscle      soreness, sports psychology, sports performance, sports massage, sports recovery,      soft tissue mobilization, deep transverse friction massage, pre-event, and post      exercise. RESULTS: RESEARCH STUDIES PERTAINING TO THE FOLLOWING GENERAL      CATEGORIES WERE IDENTIFIED AND REVIEWED: pre-event (physiological and      psychological variables), sports performance, recovery, and rehabilitation.      DISCUSSION: Despite the fact clinical research has been performed, a poor      appreciation exists for the appropriate clinical use of sports massage.      CONCLUSION: Additional studies examining the physiological and psychological      effects of sports massage are necessary in order to assist the sports physical      therapist in developing and implementing clinically significant evidence based      programs or treatments.FAU - Brummitt, JasonAU  - Brummitt JAD  - Pacific University School of Physical Therapy, Hillsboro, Oregon.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - N Am J Sports Phys TherJT  - North American journal of sports physical therapy : NAJSPTJID - 101318564PMC - PMC2953308OID - NLM: PMC2953308EDAT- 2008/02/01 00:00MHDA- 2008/02/01 00:01CRDT- 2011/04/22 06:00PST - ppublishSO  - N Am J Sports Phys Ther. 2008 Feb;3(1):7-21.PMID- 18217389OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20080125DCOM- 20080229LR  - 20080515IS  - 1896-1126 (Print)IS  - 1896-1126 (Linking)VI  - 52DP  - 2007TI  - Supplements of interest for sport-related injury and sources of supplement      information among college athletes.PG  - 50-4AB  - PURPOSE: This study examined incidence of sport-related injury, interest in      supplements to treat injury, and sources of supplement information among 145      college athletes (89 males, 56 females). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A survey was used      to assess sport-related injuries, interest in three categories of supplements to       treat injury, and sources of supplement information among college athletes who      used athletic training room and weight training facilities. Pearson chi2 was used      to evaluate differences in frequency distribution of responses by sex. RESULTS:      Sport-related injuries were experienced by 91% of athletes (93% males, 88%      females). Overall, 17% of participants were interested in supplements to improve       circulation, 34% for joint and soft tissue repair, and 22% to reduce      inflammation. Significant sex differences were not found for any supplements in      any categories evaluated. Males were more likely than females to rely on strength      coaches (37%, 20%) for supplement information. Athletic trainers (71% of      athletes), coaches (60%), and physicians (41%) were the primary professionals,      and the internet (79%), magazines (68%), and television (52%) the most popular      sources of media for supplement information. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of      athletes experience injury during their college athletic career and 17% to 34%      express an interest in supplements for injury treatment. Athletes would benefit      from scientifically sound guidance to identify appropriate supplements for injury      treatment and internet sites for supplement information. Future research should      identify if athletes are more likely to increase supplement use when they are      injured or if supplement use is more prevalent among athletes who are prone to      injury.FAU - Malinauskas, B MAU  - Malinauskas BMAD  - Department of Nutrition, East Carolina University, 148 Rivers Building,      Greenville, NC 27858-4353, USA. malinauskasb@ecu.eduFAU - Overton, R FAU  - Overton RFFAU - Carraway, V GAU  - Carraway VGFAU - Cash, B CAU  - Cash BCLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - PolandTA  - Adv Med SciJT  - Advances in medical sciencesJID - 101276222RN  - 0 (Vitamins)SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - Athletic Injuries/diagnosis/*therapyMH  - Athletic PerformanceMH  - *Dietary SupplementsMH  - FemaleMH  - Health Knowledge, Attitudes, PracticeMH  - HumansMH  - InflammationMH  - MaleMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Sex FactorsMH  - Sports Medicine/*methodsMH  - *StudentsMH  - UniversitiesMH  - VitaminsEDAT- 2008/01/26 09:00MHDA- 2008/03/01 09:00CRDT- 2008/01/26 09:00PST - ppublishSO  - Adv Med Sci. 2007;52:50-4.PMID- 18212718OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20080123DCOM- 20080416IS  - 0022-4707 (Print)IS  - 0022-4707 (Linking)VI  - 48IP  - 1DP  - 2008 MarTI  - College athletes' perceptions of social support provided by their coach before      injury and after it.PG  - 107-12AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate athletes' perceptions of social      support provided by their coach before injury and after it. METHODS: Participants      were 29 high school athletes with minor to severe injuries, who were forced to      sit out practice or competition for at least 3 days due to their injury. Male      (n=17) and female (n=12) team sport and individual sport athletes ranged in age      from 18 to 25 years (mean: 21.18; standard deviation: 1.26). Eight subjects (28%)      had major injuries, 12 (41%) had moderate injuries, and 9 (29%) had minor      injuries. Twenty-nine high school athletes completed a modified version of the      Social Support Survey. Data were collected on who provides each of 6 types of      social support, how satisfied the high school athletes are with the amount and      type of support they received, and the perceived effect of support on their      well-being. RESULTS: With two exceptions, results indicated no differences      between preinjury and postinjury satisfaction with the support provided by      coaches. The exceptions were for task challenge support and emotional challenge      support. Results indicated no differences in the perceived importance to their      well-being of support provided by coaches before injury and after it.

The impact of coaches' intrinsic and extrinsic motives      on their own satisfaction and that of their athletes.PG  - 664-73LID - 10.1111/j.1600-0838.2007.00705.x [doi]AB  - This study aims to investigate the influence of two types of motivational forces       on coach and athlete satisfaction. The focus is on intrinsic and extrinsic      motives that initiate coach-related behavior. A questionnaire that measures both       types of motivation and three facets of satisfaction (i.e., satisfaction with      performance, with instruction, and with the coach-athlete relationship) was      completed by 138 coaches. One athlete from each of the coaches who participated      in the study was also asked to complete a questionnaire that measures their      satisfaction with performance, instruction, and the coach-athlete relationship.      Results from a series of regression analyses indicated that while intrinsic      motivation was moderately and positively related to all facets of coach      satisfaction, extrinsic motivation was only related to coach satisfaction with      the coach-athlete relationship. Athletes' satisfaction with the coach-athlete      relationship was only associated with the coach's intrinsic motivation.      Interaction effects among the two types of motivation were significant suggesting      that extrinsic motivation can potentially undermine intrinsic motivation when      intrinsic motivation is low. The findings are discussed based on assumptions put       forward by self-determination theory.FAU - Jowett, SAU  - Jowett SAD  - School of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Loughborough University, Loughborough, UK.

Different oral protection devices will be illustrated, and      among them the types more suitable for the investigated age group. MATERIALS AND       METHODS: Recently we conducted a survey on a sample of 300 children between 8 and      11 years of age practicing basketball, to assess the frequency of oral traumas,      correlated predisposing factors, level of knowledge of mouthguards and possible      frequency of use of such devices. RESULTS: From the survey it emerged that only      30 subjects knew about mouthguards (15 of them received the information from      their dentist) and none of them received information from the coach or within the      sport club. Furthermore, only 3 subjects (1% of the sample) wore a mouthguard      during practice. Our study and other literature contributions highlight the total      lack of information of the practitioners, especially the young ones, and the      unconcern for these problems by the organisations (clubs) where sports are      practiced. A cycle of 2 brief conferences about orofacial trauma prevention and      use of mouthguard was administered. Regarding the type of mouthguard more      suitable to adolescent athletes, the semi-individual types of new generation seem      to be the best choice, since they can be refitted multiple times in order to      adapt to the dental and skeletal growth. Conclusion We can conclude reasserting      the absolute need of providing information about the risks of orofacial trauma      related with basketball and other contact sport activities, and to promote the      use of mouthguards as a primary protective measure among athletes, which will      considerably reduce the social costs associated with such trauma occurrences.FAU - Spinas, EAU  - Spinas EAD  - University of Cagliari, Department of Dentistry, Cagliari.      enricospinas@tiscali.itFAU - Savasta, AAU  - Savasta ALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - ItalyTA  - Eur J Paediatr DentJT  - European journal of paediatric dentistry : official journal of European Academy      of Paediatric DentistryJID - 101121881SB  - DSB  - IMMH  - Athletic Injuries/*prevention & controlMH  - Basketball/injuriesMH  - ChildMH  - Dental Care for Children/*instrumentationMH  - FemaleMH  - Health Knowledge, Attitudes, PracticeMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Maxillofacial Injuries/prevention & controlMH  - Mouth Protectors/*utilizationMH  - *Patient Education as TopicMH  - Tooth Injuries/*prevention & controlEDAT- 2008/01/01 09:00MHDA- 2008/02/22 09:00CRDT- 2008/01/01 09:00PST - ppublishSO  - Eur J Paediatr Dent. 2007 Dec;8(4):193-8.PMID- 18089903OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20071219DCOM- 20080221IS  - 0895-2779 (Print)IS  - 0895-2779 (Linking)VI  - 29IP  - 6DP  - 2007 DecTI  - Goal striving, goal attainment, and well-being: adapting and testing the      self-concordance model in sport.PG  - 763-82AB  - Grounded in self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985) and the      self-concordance model (Sheldon & Elliot, 1999), this study examined the      motivational processes underlying goal striving in sport as well as the role of      perceived coach autonomy support in the goal process. Structural equation      modeling with a sample of 210 British athletes showed that autonomous goal      motives positively predicted effort, which, in turn, predicted goal attainment.      Goal attainment was positively linked to need satisfaction, which, in turn,      predicted psychological well-being. Effort and need satisfaction were found to      mediate the associations between autonomous motives and goal attainment and      between attainment and well-being, respectively. Controlled motives negatively      predicted well-being, and coach autonomy support positively predicted both      autonomous motives and need satisfaction. Associations of autonomous motives with      effort were not reducible to goal difficulty, goal specificity, or goal efficacy.      These findings support the self-concordance model as a framework for further      research on goal setting in sport.FAU - Smith, AlisonAU  - Smith AAD  - School of Sport & Exercise Science, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston,      Birmingham, UK.FAU - Ntoumanis, NikosAU  - Ntoumanis NFAU - Duda, JoanAU  - Duda JLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Sport Exerc PsycholJT  - Journal of sport & exercise psychologyJID - 8809258SB  - IMMH  - *Adaptation, PsychologicalMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - FemaleMH  - *GoalsMH  - Great BritainMH  - HumansMH  - Interpersonal RelationsMH  - MaleMH  - Models, PsychologicalMH  - *Personal AutonomyMH  - *Physical Education and TrainingMH  - Sports/education/*psychologyMH  - TeachingEDAT- 2007/12/20 09:00MHDA- 2008/02/22 09:00CRDT- 2007/12/20 09:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Sport Exerc Psychol. 2007 Dec;29(6):763-82.PMID- 18089902OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20071219DCOM- 20080221LR  - 20141120IS  - 0895-2779 (Print)IS  - 0895-2779 (Linking)VI  - 29IP  - 6DP  - 2007 DecTI  - Predictors of poor sportspersonship in youth sports: personal attitudes and      social influences.PG  - 747-62AB  - The present study examined personal and social correlates of poor      sportspersonship among youth sport participants. Male and female athletes (n =      676) in the fifth through eighth grades from three geographic regions of the U.S.      participated in the study. Young athletes involved in basketball, soccer,      football, hockey, baseball/ softball, or lacrosse completed a questionnaire that       tapped poor sportspersonship behaviors and attitudes, team sportspersonship      norms, perceptions of the poor sportspersonship behaviors of coaches and      spectators, and the sportspersonship norms of coaches and parents. Preliminary      analyses revealed significant gender, grade, sport area, and location differences      in self-reported unsportspersonlike behavior. The main analysis revealed that      self-reported poor sport behaviors were best predicted by perceived coach and      spectator behaviors, followed by team norms, sportspersonship attitudes, and the       perceived norms of parents and coaches.

This study      compared the effectiveness of 2 methodologies for speed and agility conditioning       for random, intermittent, and dynamic activity sports (e.g., soccer, tennis,      hockey, basketball, rugby, and netball) and the necessity for specialized      coaching equipment. Two groups were delivered either a programmed method (PC) or       a random method (RC) of conditioning with a third group receiving no conditioning      (NC). PC participants used the speed, agility, quickness (SAQ) conditioning      method, and RC participants played supervised small-sided soccer games. PC was      also subdivided into 2 groups where participants either used specialized SAQ      equipment or no equipment. A total of 46 (25 males and 21 females) untrained      participants received (mean +/- SD) 12.2 +/- 2.1 hours of physical conditioning      over 6 weeks between a battery of speed and agility parameter field tests.      Two-way analysis of variance results indicated that both conditioning groups      showed a significant decrease in body mass and body mass index, although PC      achieved significantly greater improvements on acceleration, deceleration, leg      power, dynamic balance, and the overall summation of % increases when compared to      RC and NC (p < 0.05). PC in the form of SAQ exercises appears to be a superior      method for improving speed and agility parameters; however, this study found that      specialized SAQ equipment was not a requirement to observe significant      improvements. Further research is required to establish whether these benefits      transfer to sport-specific tasks as well as to the underlying mechanisms      resulting in improved performance.FAU - Bloomfield, JonathanAU  - Bloomfield JAD  - 1Sports Institute of Northern Ireland, University of Ulster, Jordanstown Campus,       Shore Road, Newtownabbey, Co.

This is a common injury in amateur and professional athletics, particularly in      contact sports. This injury can be very distressing for the athlete, his or her      family, coaches, and school personnel. Fortunately, most athletes recover quickly      and fully from this injury. However, some athletes have a slow recovery, and      there are reasons to be particularly concerned about re-injury during the acute      recovery period. Moreover, some athletes who have experienced multiple      concussions are at risk for long-term adverse effects. Neuropsychologists are      uniquely qualified to assess the neurocognitive and psychological effects of      concussion. The National Academy of Neuropsychology recommends neuropsychological      evaluation for the diagnosis, treatment, and management of sports-related      concussion at all levels of play.FAU - Moser, Rosemarie ScolaroAU  - Moser RSAD  - RSM Psychology Center, LLC, USA. r.moser@patmedia.netFAU - Iverson, Grant LAU  - Iverson GLFAU - Echemendia, Ruben JAU  - Echemendia RJFAU - Lovell, Mark RAU  - Lovell MRFAU - Schatz, PhilipAU  - Schatz PFAU - Webbe, Frank MAU  - Webbe FMFAU - Ruff, Ronald MAU  - Ruff RMFAU - Barth, Jeffrey TAU  - Barth JTCN  - NAN Policy and Planning CommitteeCN  - Donna K.

DATA SOURCES: Review of coaching      literature in psychology, sports, business, and nursing. CONCLUSIONS: Coaching      has been reported as successful in psychology, sports, business, and more      recently nursing, for assisting people to achieve goals that are important to      them. Coaching may be very effective in encouraging, inspiring, and empowering      patients to reach their maximum health potential, particularly if lifestyle      change is required; however, coaching research is in its early stages. Coaching      is not well defined, so claims of coaching benefits must be viewed cautiously.      Coaching is an expected NP role competency, but it is not well explicated in the       literature. Defining the concept of coaching from multidisciplinary consensus,      expanding knowledge of the coaching process, and consciously implementing      coaching communication in the NP/patient primary care encounter may result in      measurable outcomes that demonstrate coaching effectiveness. IMPLICATIONS FOR      PRACTICE: Coaching fits well with the holistic, collaborative approach to patient      care which NPs value. Coaching provides an opportunity to shift traditional      thinking about patient/provider relationships and how to motivate patients toward      behavior change. The challenge for NPs is to take the time to learn the coaching       process, employ coaching communication strategies in the primary care encounter,       and engage in research that measures coaching effectiveness.FAU - Hayes, EileenAU  - Hayes EAD  - School of Nursing, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Massachusetts, USA.      efhayes@nursing.umass.eduFAU - Kalmakis, Karen AAU  - Kalmakis KALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - J Am Acad Nurse PractJT  - Journal of the American Academy of Nurse PractitionersJID - 8916634SB  - NMH  - Clinical CompetenceMH  - Counseling/*organization & administrationMH  - GoalsMH  - Health BehaviorMH  - Health Knowledge, Attitudes, PracticeMH  - Health Promotion/*organization & administrationMH  - Helping BehaviorMH  - HumansMH  - Nurse Practitioners/*organization & administration/psychologyMH  - *Nurse's Role/psychologyMH  - Nurse-Patient RelationsMH  - Nursing Evaluation ResearchMH  - Nursing Process/*organization & administrationMH  - Patient Education as TopicMH  - Patient Participation/methods/psychologyMH  - Power (Psychology)MH  - Primary Health CareMH  - Self Care/methods/psychologyMH  - Social SupportRF  - 72EDAT- 2007/11/01 09:00MHDA- 2008/02/02 09:00CRDT- 2007/11/01 09:00AID - JAAN264 [pii]AID - 10.1111/j.1745-7599.2007.00264.x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Am Acad Nurse Pract. 2007 Nov;19(11):555-62.PMID- 17959129OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20071025DCOM- 20071207IS  - 0214-9915 (Print)IS  - 0214-9915 (Linking)VI  - 19IP  - 4DP  - 2007 NovTI  - [Psychometric evaluation of the Coach Orientation Questionnaire with a Spanish      sample of handball coaches].PG  - 699-705AB  - The purpose of this study was to develop a questionnaire to investigate      volleyball coaches' orientations toward the coaching process.

Thus, within the       heteronormative sport environment it was hypothesized that men's liking of a team      coached by a gay or lesbian may be influenced more than women's liking.      Respondents were college-age men (n=130) and women (n=98), former sport      participants. Multivariate analysis of covariance (controlling for the presence      of gay and lesbian friends and acquaintances) supported the hypothesis.

In the first, 317 athletes completed the Coaches'      Encouragement of Athletes' Imagery Use Questionnaire. In the second, 215 coaches       completed a slightly modified version of this questionnaire. It was found that      coaches and athletes generally agreed on the relative frequency with which      coaches encourage athletes to use imagery across the 4 Ws (i.e., where, when,      why, and what). Coaches promoted imagery use more in conjunction with competition      than training and injury rehabilitation, and higher-level coaches encouraged      imagery use far more than their recreational counterparts. In addition, the level      of athlete being coached had a major impact on how much or little coaches      encouraged their athletes to use imagery. Coaches encouraged higher level      athletes (i.e., international, national, varsity) to use imagery more than club      and recreational athletes.FAU - Jedlic, BrieAU  - Jedlic BAD  - School of Kinesiology, University of Western Ontario, Ontario, London, Canada.FAU - Hall, NathanAU  - Hall NFAU - Munroe-Chandler, KristaAU  - Munroe-Chandler KFAU - Hall, CraigAU  - Hall CLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Res Q Exerc SportJT  - Research quarterly for exercise and sportJID - 8006373SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - *Competitive BehaviorMH  - Educational StatusMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - *Imagery (Psychotherapy)MH  - MaleMH  - *MotivationMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Reinforcement, SocialMH  - Sports/*psychologyMH  - Sports MedicineMH  - *TeachingMH  - Time FactorsEDAT- 2007/10/19 09:00MHDA- 2007/12/07 09:00CRDT- 2007/10/19 09:00AID - 10.1080/02701367.2007.10599432 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Res Q Exerc Sport. 2007 Sep;78(4):351-63.PMID- 17932245OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20071012DCOM- 20071206IS  - 0145-4455 (Print)IS  - 0145-4455 (Linking)VI  - 31IP  - 6DP  - 2007 NovTI  - Development and initial psychometric evaluation of the sport interference      checklist.PG  - 937-57AB  - The Sport Interference Checklist (SIC) was developed in 141 athletes to assist in      the concurrent assessment of cognitive and behavioral problems experienced by      athletes in both training (Problems in Sports Training Scale, PSTS) and      competition (Problems in Sports Competition Scale, PSCS).

Team-Up for Youth, Sports PLUS Global, and the National      Recreation and Park Association are the three organizations highlighted in this      article. Team-Up for Youth's mission is to pioneer innovative strategies to      support the healthy development of youth by strengthening and expanding      afterschool sports and physical activity programs. Team-Up works with youth      sports providers, policymakers and public officials, and staff and students at      colleges and universities in the San Francisco Bay Area. It concentrates on five       areas: training and education, coaching corps, grant making, public policy, and      knowledge creating and sharing. Sports PLUS Global is an international      organization that delivers educational training to communities using sports to      promote human development, social change, and human rights. It uses the Positive       Learning Using Sports (PLUS) method to reach children, coaches, and educators in       camps and afterschool programs. The PLUS method employs twelve steps that are      described in detail in the article. The National Recreation and Park Association       (NRPA) engages national partners and local park and recreation agencies to      improve the quality of youth sports nationwide. NRPA, in partnership with Sports       Illustrated magazine, developed and manages the Sports Illustrated GOOD SPORTS      initiative. Communities are improving youth sports through the following      elements: teaching life skills, empowering success among youth, promoting      physical activity and healthy lifestyles, and strengthening communities.FAU - Wicks, AnneAU  - Wicks AFAU - Beedy, Jeffrey PAU  - Beedy JPFAU - Spangler, Kathy JAU  - Spangler KJFAU - Perkins, Daniel FAU  - Perkins DFLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - New Dir Youth DevJT  - New directions for youth developmentJID - 101090644SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - *Adolescent DevelopmentMH  - Age FactorsMH  - ChildMH  - *Child DevelopmentMH  - Community Networks/*organization & administrationMH  - *Health Planning OrganizationsMH  - Health Planning Technical AssistanceMH  - Health Promotion/methods/*organization & administrationMH  - HumansMH  - Models, EducationalMH  - Organizational InnovationMH  - Program DevelopmentMH  - Program EvaluationMH  - *Sports/physiology/psychologyMH  - United StatesEDAT- 2007/10/10 09:00MHDA- 2008/01/01 09:00CRDT- 2007/10/10 09:00AID - 10.1002/yd.226 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - New Dir Youth Dev. 2007 Fall;(115):107-18, 10-1.PMID- 17924435OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20071015DCOM- 20071231IS  - 1533-8916 (Print)IS  - 1533-8916 (Linking)IP  - 115DP  - 2007 FallTI  - Characteristics of sports-based youth development programs.PG  - 75-84, 8-9AB  - The term "sports-based youth development programs" is coined and defined in the      context of the community youth development framework. Sports-based youth      development programs are out-of-school-time programs that use a particular sport       to facilitate learning and life skill development in youth. Community youth      development programs use a community youth development approach to create      opportunities for youth to connect to others, develop skills, and use those      skills to contribute to their communities. This, in turn, increases their ability      to succeed. The authors describe how sports-based youth development programs can       be contexts that promote positive youth development. The features of positive      developmental settings for youth from the work of the National Research Council      and the Institute of Medicine, as well as the features identified by other      researchers, are presented in the context of sports-based youth development      programs. For example, a sports program that provides appropriate structure has      delineated clear rules, expectations, and responsibilities for youth, parents,      coaches, officials, and other organizers.FAU - Perkins, Daniel FAU  - Perkins DFAD  - Department of Agricultural and Extension Education at the Pennsylvania State      University, USA.FAU - Noam, Gil GAU  - Noam GGLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - New Dir Youth DevJT  - New directions for youth developmentJID - 101090644SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - *Adolescent DevelopmentMH  - AdultMH  - Age FactorsMH  - ChildMH  - *Child DevelopmentMH  - Community Networks/*organization & administrationMH  - Health Promotion/methods/*organization & administrationMH  - HumansMH  - Peer GroupMH  - Program DevelopmentMH  - Self EfficacyMH  - Social IdentificationMH  - Sports/physiology/psychology/*standardsMH  - Time FactorsEDAT- 2007/10/10 09:00MHDA- 2008/01/01 09:00CRDT- 2007/10/10 09:00AID - 10.1002/yd.224 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - New Dir Youth Dev. 2007 Fall;(115):75-84, 8-9.PMID- 17924429OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20071015DCOM- 20071231IS  - 1533-8916 (Print)IS  - 1533-8916 (Linking)IP  - 115DP  - 2007 FallTI  - Improving health through youth sports: is participation enough?PG  - 27-41, 6AB  - The health benefits of engaging in regular physical activity are widely known:      enhanced cardiorespiratory fitness, increased muscular strength and endurance,      and favorable cholesterol and other profiles. Nevertheless, particularly in youth      sports programs run by volunteer, and perhaps inadequately trained, coaches, many      youth may not realize the health benefits of sports participation due to a number      of factors, among them, inappropriate coach-child ratios, limited space, or      mismatched expectations between coaches and those of children and their parents.       There are specific strategies that can be implemented to ensure that youth      receive the maximize benefits from participation in sports. These strategies are       presented in the following areas: frequency, intensity, and duration;      cross-training or complementary exercise; access points; utilization of space and      time; nutrition; and rest. For instance, with regard to the frequency of physical      activity, some sports, including soccer, basketball, and singles tennis, require       extensive physical effort over an extended period of time, while others, such as       baseball and football, have a lot of downtime. Thus, in order for children and      youth to meet the recommendation of participating in moderate or vigorous      physical activity at least four times per week, sports programs need to have      opportunities for all athletes to practice hard. Finally, the author discusses      the point at which participation in sports might be too much, leading to      significant injuries, frustration, and resentment.FAU - Bergeron, Michael FAU  - Bergeron MFAD  - Medical College of Georgia , USA.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - New Dir Youth DevJT  - New directions for youth developmentJID - 101090644SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - *Adolescent DevelopmentMH  - Age FactorsMH  - ChildMH  - *Child DevelopmentMH  - Community NetworksMH  - Competitive BehaviorMH  - Energy MetabolismMH  - Health Promotion/*methodsMH  - HumansMH  - Motor Activity/*physiologyMH  - Physical Fitness/*physiology/psychologyMH  - SchoolsMH  - Sports/*physiology/psychologyMH  - Time FactorsRF  - 29EDAT- 2007/10/10 09:00MHDA- 2008/01/01 09:00CRDT- 2007/10/10 09:00AID - 10.1002/yd.221 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - New Dir Youth Dev. 2007 Fall;(115):27-41, 6.PMID- 17917166OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20071005DCOM- 20071218IS  - 1053-8135 (Print)IS  - 1053-8135 (Linking)VI  - 22IP  - 3DP  - 2007TI  - The effects of explanatory style on concussion outcomes in sport.PG  - 161-7AB  - Individuals with an optimistic explanatory style have generally been linked with       improved mental and physical health across a variety of chronic and serious      conditions. The purpose of the current study was to examine the effects of      explanatory style on recovery time and number of sport-related concussions      suffered in the last 12 months. University varsity athletes (n=170) suffering      from at least one concussion over the last 12 months from six contact or      collision team sports completed both the Attributional Style Questionnaire and      the Sport History Questionnaire. The results indicated that athletes with an      optimistic explanatory style took longer to recover than athletes with a      pessimistic or average explanatory style. More specifically, optimistic athletes       who suffered a complex concussion (requiring more than 7 days to recover) took      significantly longer to return to play. However, the results showed that      explanatory style did not influence whether an athlete suffered subsequent      concussions. Overall, the current results can be used to better understand the      psychology of concussions, as well as concussion prevention efforts and      management strategies.FAU - Shapcott, Erin J BAU  - Shapcott EJAD  - McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.FAU - Bloom, Gordon AAU  - Bloom GAFAU - Johnston, Karen MAU  - Johnston KMFAU - Loughead, Todd MAU  - Loughead TMFAU - Delaney, J ScottAU  - Delaney JSLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - NetherlandsTA  - NeuroRehabilitationJT  - NeuroRehabilitationJID - 9113791SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Athletic Injuries/epidemiology/physiopathology/*psychologyMH  - Brain Concussion/epidemiology/physiopathology/*psychologyMH  - Cohort StudiesMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - *Internal-External ControlMH  - MaleMH  - *PersonalityMH  - Personality InventoryMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Recovery of FunctionMH  - RecurrenceMH  - Time FactorsEDAT- 2007/10/06 09:00MHDA- 2007/12/19 09:00CRDT- 2007/10/06 09:00PST - ppublishSO  - NeuroRehabilitation. 2007;22(3):161-7.PMID- 17909417OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20071002DCOM- 20080111LR  - 20080522IS  - 0195-9131 (Print)IS  - 0195-9131 (Linking)VI  - 39IP  - 10DP  - 2007 OctTI  - American College of Sports Medicine position stand. The female athlete triad.PG  - 1867-82AB  - The female athlete triad (Triad) refers to the interrelationships among energy      availability, menstrual function, and bone mineral density, which may have      clinical manifestations including eating disorders, functional hypothalamic      amenorrhea, and osteoporosis. With proper nutrition, these same relationships      promote robust health. Athletes are distributed along a spectrum between health      and disease, and those at the pathological end may not exhibit all these clinical      conditions simultaneously. Energy availability is defined as dietary energy      intake minus exercise energy expenditure. Low energy availability appears to be      the factor that impairs reproductive and skeletal health in the Triad, and it may      be inadvertent, intentional, or psychopathological. Most effects appear to occur       below an energy availability of 30 kcal.kg(-1) of fat-free mass per day.      Restrictive eating behaviors practiced by girls and women in sports or physical      activities that emphasize leanness are of special concern. For prevention and      early intervention, education of athletes, parents, coaches, trainers, judges,      and administrators is a priority. Athletes should be assessed for the Triad at      the preparticipation physical and/or annual health screening exam, and whenever      an athlete presents with any of the Triad's clinical conditions. Sport      administrators should also consider rule changes to discourage unhealthy weight      loss practices. A multidisciplinary treatment team should include a physician or       other health-care professional, a registered dietitian, and, for athletes with      eating disorders, a mental health practitioner. Additional valuable team members       may include a certified athletic trainer, an exercise physiologist, and the      athlete's coach, parents and other family members. The first aim of treatment for      any Triad component is to increase energy availability by increasing energy      intake and/or reducing exercise energy expenditure. Nutrition counseling and      monitoring are sufficient interventions for many athletes, but eating disorders      warrant psychotherapy. Athletes with eating disorders should be required to meet       established criteria to continue exercising, and their training and competition      may need to be modified. No pharmacological agent adequately restores bone loss      or corrects metabolic abnormalities that impair health and performance in      athletes with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea.FAU - Nattiv, AureliaAU  - Nattiv AFAU - Loucks, Anne BAU  - Loucks ABFAU - Manore, Melinda MAU  - Manore MMFAU - Sanborn, Charlotte FAU  - Sanborn CFFAU - Sundgot-Borgen, JorunnAU  - Sundgot-Borgen JFAU - Warren, Michelle PAU  - Warren MPCN  - American College of Sports MedicineLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Med Sci Sports ExercJT  - Medicine and science in sports and exerciseJID - 8005433SB  - IMSB  - SCIN - Med Sci Sports Exerc. 2008 Mar;40(3):588; author reply 589.

QoL can be assessed using both generic and      disease-specific instruments. QoL assessment in haemophilia is a relatively new      area of study; the first data were published in 1990 using generic QoL      questionnaires. Only recently have haemophilia-specific questionnaires been      developed, first for children and then for adults. Because sports activities      include not only physical and functional aspects, but also have an impact on an      individual's self-esteem and social interactions, they should play an essential      role in QoL assessment. Until the 1970s, persons with haemophilia were advised to      avoid any kind of physical activity because of the risk of bleeds. Nowadays,      however, the attitude towards sports for patients with haemophilia has changed,      and the World Federation of Haemophilia has formulated recommendations concerning      physical activities for patients with haemophilia. Although sports activities are      recommended, their importance as an integral element in haemophilia management      has not yet been widely recognized. Awareness of the importance of sports      activities for this patient group has increased, and several sports projects are       ongoing. For example, a twice-annual sports camp for adult patients has been held      in Germany for the past 2 years; and physical improvements, QoL and subjective      training effects are being measured. Another study is investigating the      prevalence of sports activities in Italian children with haemophilia and their      attitudes towards sports and is also assessing QoL. In Israel, a study is planned      in which haemophilic children will participate in a karate training programme,      and a QoL evaluation will be added to the physical assessment. In conclusion,      sports activities can improve not only physical well-being, but also the      emotional and social well-being of persons with haemophilia and, therefore,      should become part of the global approach to haemophilia management.FAU - VON Mackensen, SAU  - VON Mackensen SAD  - Institute and Policlinic for Medical Psychology, University of Hamburg, Hamburg,       Germany. s.mackensen@uke.uni-hamburg.deLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPT  - ReviewPL  - EnglandTA  - HaemophiliaJT  - Haemophilia : the official journal of the World Federation of HemophiliaJID - 9442916SB  - IMMH  - FemaleMH  - Hemarthrosis/physiopathology/*prevention & controlMH  - Hemophilia A/physiopathology/*rehabilitationMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Physical Fitness/*physiology/psychologyMH  - Quality of Life/*psychologyMH  - QuestionnairesRF  - 59EDAT- 2007/09/22 09:00MHDA- 2007/12/11 09:00CRDT- 2007/09/22 09:00AID - HAE1505 [pii]AID - 10.1111/j.1365-2516.2007.01505.x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Haemophilia. 2007 Sep;13 Suppl 2:38-43.PMID- 17880724OWN - NLMSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINEDA  - 20071029DCOM- 20100609LR  - 20100916IS  - 1746-1340 (Electronic)IS  - 1746-1340 (Linking)VI  - 15DP  - 2007TI  - Australian chiropractic sports medicine: half way there or living on a prayer?PG  - 14AB  - Sports chiropractic within Australia has a chequered historical background of      unorthodox individualistic displays of egocentric treatment approaches that      emphasise specific technique preference and individual prowess rather than      standardised evidence based management. This situation has changed in recent      years with the acceptance of many within sports chiropractic to operate under an       evidence informed banner and to embrace a research culture. Despite recent      developments within the sports chiropractic movement, the profession is still      plagued by a minority of practitioners continuing to espouse certain marginal and      outlandish technique systems that beleaguer the mainstream core of sports      chiropractic as a cohesive and homogeneous group. Modern chiropractic management       is frequently multimodal in nature and incorporates components of passive and      active care. Such management typically incorporates spinal and peripheral      manipulation, mobilisation, soft tissue techniques, rehabilitation and      therapeutic exercises. Externally, sports chiropractic has faced hurdles too,      with a lack of recognition and acceptance by organized and orthodox sports      medical groups. Whilst some arguments against the inclusion of chiropractic may      be legitimate due to its historical baggage, much of the argument appears to be      anti-competitive, insecure and driven by a closed-shop mentality.sequently,      chiropractic as a profession still remains a pariah to the organised sports      medicine world. Add to this an uncertain continuing education system, a lack of      protection for the title 'sports chiropractor', a lack of a recognized specialist      status and a lack of support from traditional chiropractic, the challenges for      the growth and acceptance of the sports chiropractor are considerable. This      article outlines the historical and current challenges, both internal and      external, faced by sports chiropractic within Australia and proposes positive      changes that will assist in recognition and inclusion of sports chiropractic in      both chiropractic and multi-disciplinary sports medicine alike.FAU - Pollard, HenryAU  - Pollard HAD  - Department of Health and Chiropractic, Macquarie University, NSW, Australia.      hpollard@optushome.com.auFAU - Hoskins, WayneAU  - Hoskins WFAU - McHardy, AndrewAU  - McHardy AFAU - Bonello, RodAU  - Bonello RFAU - Garbutt, PeterAU  - Garbutt PFAU - Swain, MikeAU  - Swain MFAU - Dragasevic, GeorgeAU  - Dragasevic GFAU - Pribicevic, MarioAU  - Pribicevic MFAU - Vitiello, AndrewAU  - Vitiello ALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20070919PL  - EnglandTA  - Chiropr OsteopatJT  - Chiropractic & osteopathyJID - 101245797PMC - PMC2042981OID - NLM: PMC2042981EDAT- 2007/09/21 09:00MHDA- 2007/09/21 09:01CRDT- 2007/09/21 09:00PHST- 2007/03/14 [received]PHST- 2007/09/19 [accepted]PHST- 2007/09/19 [aheadofprint]AID - 1746-1340-15-14 [pii]AID - 10.1186/1746-1340-15-14 [doi]PST - epublishSO  - Chiropr Osteopat. 2007 Sep 19;15:14.PMID- 17852663OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20080124DCOM- 20080212LR  - 20131121IS  - 0264-0414 (Print)IS  - 0264-0414 (Linking)VI  - 25IP  - 14DP  - 2007 DecTI  - Perceptions of elite coaches and sports scientists of the research needs for      elite coaching practice.PG  - 1577-86AB  - A major objective of sports scientists and elite coaches is the enhancement of      athletic performance. Despite this common goal, there is a general perception      that research in sports science does not meet the needs of coaches. A study using      survey and interview examined the perceptions of elite coaches and sports science      researchers in Australia regarding the research needs of elite coaching.      Congruence was found between coaches and researchers regarding research practice       at the elite level. Both groups held common perceptions on the importance and      application of research, the methods by which research questions are determined,       and the qualities valued in elite coaches and sports science researchers.      However, elite coaches perceived a need for more research in the area of sports      psychology, dissemination of research findings via coaching clinics and      sports-specific magazines, and the use of more appropriate "lay" language in      information dissemination.FAU - Williams, S JohnAU  - Williams SJAD  - Applied Research Centre, Australian Institute of Sport, Belconnen, ACT.      john.williams@ausport.gov.auFAU - Kendall, LawrenceAU  - Kendall LLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - EnglandTA  - J Sports SciJT  - Journal of sports sciencesJID - 8405364SB  - IMMH  - Athletic Performance/*education/*psychologyMH  - AustraliaMH  - Biomechanical PhenomenaMH  - Data CollectionMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - Interviews as TopicMH  - MaleMH  - Needs AssessmentMH  - *PerceptionMH  - *Physical Education and TrainingMH  - ResearchMH  - Sports Medicine/*educationMH  - *TeachingEDAT- 2007/09/14 09:00MHDA- 2008/02/13 09:00CRDT- 2007/09/14 09:00AID - 781314799 [pii]AID - 10.1080/02640410701245550 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Sci. 2007 Dec;25(14):1577-86.PMID- 17850973OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20071107DCOM- 20080104IS  - 0304-4017 (Print)IS  - 0304-4017 (Linking)VI  - 150IP  - 1-2DP  - 2007 Nov 30TI  - Molecular diagnosis of certain nematode infections can save life and beauty, and       preserve breeds of socially relevant and sporting animals.PG  - 1-5AB  - The recognition that the health and welfare of some humans are improved through      contact and relationships with animals is now established. Two commonly      recognized assistance animals are dogs and horses. Both provide therapeutic      benefits to humans with some physical and mental illnesses and both assist people      with disabilities. Moreover, the public and scientific attention to the health      and conservation of many animal breeds is also increasing worldwide. In the past       few years, two potentially life-threatening nematode infections that can induce      tumours or tumour-like masses in canids and equids, spirocercosis and      draschiosis/habronemosis, respectively, are emerging in several areas of the      world.

If      combined with jet lag syndrome, these specific conditions can favor altered      physical and mental performance. There is always the temptation to use drugs as a      simple way to reduce the penalizing effects. The available compounds known to      affect sleep and wakefulness include hypnotics, benzodiazepines and non      benzodiazepines such as temazepam, zolopidem, and zopiclone, stimulants such as      amphetamine and amphetamine-like agents, adrafinil, modafinil, caffeine and      chronobiotics substances such as melatonin and, more recently, slow release      caffeine. In the sports area, all of these substances except caffeine are on the       list of forbidden products, although special authorizations linked to known      disease conditions are allowed. In the military setting, the environment may be      similar, but the context of use is very different. In the context of a rescue      mission, the current practice in the French military organization is to place      modafinil pills in the ejection seat of fight planes and in rescue boats. A      second context is the use of anti-sleep agents under orders; the debate continues      on this and the appropriate recommendations in this context. Self-medication is a      third condition, in which case no rules have been defined.FAU - Lagarde, DAU  - Lagarde DAD  - Institut de medecine navale (IMNSSA), BP 610, 83800 Toulon Armees.      d.lagarde@imnssa.netLA  - frePT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewTT  - Approche pharmacologique de la desynchronisation du rythme veille-sommeil en      milieu militaire et sportif.PL  - FranceTA  - Ann Pharm FrJT  - Annales pharmaceutiques francaisesJID - 2985176RRN  - 0 (Central Nervous System Stimulants)RN  - 0 (Hypnotics and Sedatives)SB  - IMMH  - Central Nervous System Stimulants/therapeutic useMH  - HumansMH  - Hypnotics and Sedatives/therapeutic useMH  - Jet Lag Syndrome/drug therapy/physiopathologyMH  - *Military PersonnelMH  - Sleep/drug effects/*physiologyMH  - Sports/*physiologyMH  - Wakefulness/drug effects/*physiologyRF  - 12EDAT- 2007/07/27 09:00MHDA- 2007/09/19 09:00CRDT- 2007/07/27 09:00AID - MDOI-APF-07-2007-65-4-0003-4509-101019-200702106 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Ann Pharm Fr. 2007 Jul;65(4):258-64.PMID- 17645373OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20070724DCOM- 20071106IS  - 0112-1642 (Print)IS  - 0112-1642 (Linking)VI  - 37IP  - 8DP  - 2007TI  - A review of epidemiology of paediatric elbow injuries in sports.PG  - 717-35AB  - The elbow is a common site of orthopaedic injury in the paediatric population.      The number of these injuries continues to rise following increased levels of      participation in paediatric recreational and competitive sport. Injuries to the      paediatric elbow can be classified as either overuse or acute. Delineating injury      patterns to the elbow in children can be challenging, given the cartilaginous      composition of the distal humerus and the multiple secondary ossification centres      that appear and unite with the epiphysis at defined ages. Pitching in baseball,      serving in tennis, spiking in volleyball, passing in American football and      launching in javelin-throwing can all produce elbow pathology by forceful valgus       stress, with medial stretching, lateral compression and posterior impingement. In      children and adolescents, the epiphyseal plate is weaker than the surrounding      ligaments, predisposing them to epiphyseal plate injuries. On the other hand,      post-pubescent or skeletally mature athletes are more prone to tendinous or      ligamentous injury. Injuries may cause significant impact on the athlete, parents      and healthcare system. With the exception of baseball, there are few prospective       cohort studies on the epidemiological trends of childhood elbow injuries in other      sports. This paper aims to describe the epidemiological trends in paediatric      elbow injuries related to sports, suggests prevention strategies and discusses      the scope for further research. A web-based search of existing articles      pertaining to paediatric elbow injuries in sports was performed. The implications      of acute and overuse injuries and the possibility of permanent damage should be      understood by parents, coaches and the athletes. Proper understanding of the      intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors that could lead to elbow injuries is thus      required. Measures to prevent elbow injuries should include proper coaching,      warm-up, officiation, legislation, medical expertise and protective gear. There      are still many opportunities for prospective studies and other research projects       among young athletes in various sports. Current studies will serve as a baseline       for future research to assess the success of specific interventions in reducing      the incidence of elbow injury in the paediatric athlete. Further epidemiological       studies in various sports will help expand our knowledge and prevent potential      disability and deformity in the paediatric elbow.FAU - Magra, MerzeshAU  - Magra MAD  - Department of Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery, Keele University School of      Medicine, Stoke-on-Trent, England.FAU - Caine, DennisAU  - Caine DFAU - Maffulli, NicolaAU  - Maffulli NLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - New ZealandTA  - Sports MedJT  - Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)JID - 8412297SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Arm Injuries/*epidemiology/prevention & controlMH  - Athletic Injuries/*epidemiology/prevention & controlMH  - ChildMH  - Cumulative Trauma DisordersMH  - Elbow/*injuriesMH  - Elbow Joint/*injuriesMH  - HumansRF  - 133EDAT- 2007/07/25 09:00MHDA- 2007/11/07 09:00CRDT- 2007/07/25 09:00AID - 3785 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Sports Med. 2007;37(8):717-35.PMID- 17641103OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20071130DCOM- 20080117IS  - 1552-3365 (Electronic)IS  - 0363-5465 (Linking)VI  - 35IP  - 12DP  - 2007 DecTI  - A survey of sports medicine physicians regarding psychological issues in      patient-athletes.PG  - 2140-7AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the extent to which sports medicine physicians encounter      and discuss psychological issues among athletes they treat and to evaluate      physicians' perceptions of the availability and efficacy of sport psychologists      and other mental health resources. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS:       A survey was sent via e-mail to all physician members of 4 prominent sports      medicine professional associations: the American Orthopaedic Society for Sports      Medicine, American College of Sports Medicine, American Medical Society for      Sports Medicine, and American Osteopathic Academy of Sports Medicine. RESULTS:      The extent to which respondents discuss psychological issues with athletes varied      by subspecialty and by specific issues assessed. Fears about reinjury, fears      related to surgery, and lack of patience with recovery/rehabilitation were the 3       most common injury-related topics discussed with patient-athletes. The 3 most      common non-injury-related topics discussed were stress/pressure, anxiety, and      burnout. Family practitioners were more likely to discuss injury-related      psychological issues than were orthopaedic surgeons. Orthopaedic surgeons      reported the lowest frequencies of discussing non-injury-related psychological      issues. Only 19% of all respondents indicated there were adequate numbers of      sport psychologists and other mental health professionals in their geographical      area to treat the needs of athletes. Three quarters of respondents reported they       rarely or never referred athletes to sport psychologists for injury-related      issues, and two thirds indicated they rarely or never referred athletes to sport       psychologists for non-injury-related problems. Respondents rated sport      psychologists and athletic trainers/physical therapists to be moderately      effective in working with athletes regarding psychological problems. CONCLUSION:       Sports medicine physicians frequently encounter psychological issues with      patient-athletes. There is a need for tools to facilitate assessment of these      problems as well as greater communication between the mental health community and      sports medicine physicians. In addition, knowledge of and access to professionals      who are specifically trained to deal with the sometimes unique psychological      needs of athletes should be improved.FAU - Mann, Barton JAU  - Mann BJAD  - American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine, 6300 North River Road, Suite      500, Rosemont, IL 60018, USA. bart@aossm.orgFAU - Grana, William AAU  - Grana WAFAU - Indelicato, Peter AAU  - Indelicato PAFAU - O'Neill, Daniel FAU  - O'Neill DFFAU - George, Steven ZAU  - George SZLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20070719PL  - United StatesTA  - Am J Sports MedJT  - The American journal of sports medicineJID - 7609541SB  - IMCIN - Am J Sports Med. 2007 Dec;35(12):1995-6.

It is unclear, however,       whether digit ratio makes a contribution over and above salient personality      variables. The present study, which included female participants, measured four      personality traits and one cognitive ability (mental rotation) that have been      linked to both sports achievement and sex. The significant relationship between      digit ratio and sporting achievement was nearly identical in women and men. A      multiple regression showed that when significant correlates of sporting ability      (weight, height, years playing, hours per week training, social potency, and      mental rotation) were entered first, the contribution of digit ratio remained      highly significant. We suggest that physiological as well as psychological      factors may be an important avenue for future study.FAU - Tester, NicholasAU  - Tester NAD  - Durham University, UK.FAU - Campbell, AnneAU  - Campbell ALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J PersJT  - Journal of personalityJID - 2985194RRN  - 0 (Biological Markers)RN  - 3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Aptitude/*physiologyMH  - Biological MarkersMH  - EnglandMH  - FemaleMH  - Fingers/*anatomy & histologyMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - PregnancyMH  - *Prenatal Exposure Delayed EffectsMH  - Regression AnalysisMH  - Sex CharacteristicsMH  - Sex FactorsMH  - Sports/*physiologyMH  - Testosterone/*physiologyEDAT- 2007/06/20 09:00MHDA- 2007/10/20 09:00CRDT- 2007/06/20 09:00AID - JOPY452 [pii]AID - 10.1111/j.1467-6494.2007.00452.x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Pers. 2007 Aug;75(4):663-77.PMID- 17566428OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20070614DCOM- 20070801IS  - 0031-5125 (Print)IS  - 0031-5125 (Linking)VI  - 104IP  - 2DP  - 2007 AprTI  - Internal and external imagery perspective measurement and use in imagining open      and closed sports skills: an exploratory study.PG  - 387-404AB  - This study explored the measurement and use of internal and external imagery      perspectives during imagery of open and closed sports skills. Participants (N=41;      male=23; female=18), ages 14 to 28 (M = 19.4 yr.; SD = 3.1), who were recruited      from undergraduate classes in human movement and physical education, and local      sporting teams, completed the Imagery Use Questionnaire and then imagined      performing eight common sports skills, four open skills and four closed skills,      in a random order. Participants provided concurrent verbalisation during their      imagery. Immediately after imagining each skill, participants completed a rating       scale and retrospective verbalisation of imagery perspective use. Analysis      indicated that the questionnaire gave a general imagery perspective preference      but was not a strong predictor of imagery used on specific occasions. The three      measures of imagery perspective were equivalent in imagining performing      particular skills. Participants experienced more internal imagery than external      imagery while imagining the eight sports skills, but there was no significant      difference between perspective use on the open and closed skills.FAU - Spittle, MichaelAU  - Spittle MAD  - School of Human Movement and Sport Sciences, University of Ballarat, P.O.

We tested the effects of this      intervention on motivational climate and on changes in male and female      athletes'cognitive and somatic performance anxiety over the course of a      basketball season. Hierarchical linear modeling analyses revealed that the      athletes in the intervention condition perceived their coaches as being more      mastery-involving on the Motivational Climate Scale for Youth Sports when      compared to athletes in an untreated control condition. Relative to athletes who       played for untrained coaches, those who played for the trained coaches exhibited       decreases on all subscales of the Sport Anxiety Scale-2 and on total anxiety      score from preseason to late season.

Many of these laws and biomechanical principles, however,      are counterintuitive to a lot of people. There are also several problems in the      application of biomechanics to sports, so the application of biomechanics in the       qualitative analysis of sport skills by many coaches has been limited.      Biomechanics scholars have long been interested in developing principles that      facilitate the qualitative application of biomechanics to improve movement      performance and reduce the risk of injury. This paper summarizes the major North       American efforts to establish a set of general biomechanical principles of      movement, and illustrates how principles can be used to improve the application      of biomechanics in the qualitative analysis of sport technique. A coach helping a      player with a tennis serve is presented as an example. The standardization of      terminology for biomechanical principles is proposed as an important first step      in improving the application ofbiomechanics in sport. There is also a need for      international cooperation and research on the effectiveness of applying      biomechanical principles in the coaching of sport techniques.FAU - Knudson, DuaneAU  - Knudson DAD  - Department of Kinesiology, California State University, Chico, CA 95929-0330,      USA. dknudson@csuchico.eduLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - ScotlandTA  - Sports BiomechJT  - Sports biomechanics / International Society of Biomechanics in SportsJID - 101151352SB  - IMMH  - Biomechanical Phenomena/*methodsMH  - HumansMH  - Physical Education and Training/*methodsMH  - Physical PhenomenaMH  - PhysicsMH  - Sports/*physiologyMH  - Tennis/*physiologyMH  - Terminology as TopicEDAT- 2007/06/05 09:00MHDA- 2007/07/20 09:00CRDT- 2007/06/05 09:00AID - 10.1080/14763140601062567 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Sports Biomech. 2007 Jan;6(1):109-18.PMID- 17479578OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20070507DCOM- 20070627IS  - 0270-1367 (Print)IS  - 0270-1367 (Linking)VI  - 78IP  - 2DP  - 2007 MarTI  - Sport commitment among competitive female gymnasts: a developmental perspective.PG  - 90-102AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine age and competitive level differences in      the relationship between determinants and level of sport commitment. Gymnasts (N       = 304) comprised three age groups (8-11, 11-14.5, and 14.5-18 years) and two      competitive levels (Levels 5-6 and 8-10). Multiple regression analyses revealed:       (a) perceived costs and social constraints from parents and best friends were the      strongest predictors of commitment for the youngest gymnasts, (b) perceived      costs, personal investments, and parent social constraints predicted commitment      for 11-14.5-year-old gymnasts, and (c) perceived competence and costs predicted      commitment for the oldest gymnasts. Competitive level differences also emerged;      for Level 5-6 gymnasts, personal investments, perceived costs, coach social      support, and social constraints by coach, best friend, and teammates were      predictors of commitment. Personal investments and teammate social constraints      were significant predictors for Level 8-10 gymnasts.

What reasons are able to eliminate the handicapped from process       of regular going in for sport? Three groups of men participated. The group of      disabled sportsmen included 39 subjects, the group of non-active disabled people       36 subjects and the group of able-bodied students 45 subjects. All the involved      people answered the questions of the questionnaire, which concerned factors      associated with sport activity of the handicapped and their socio-demographic      characteristics, among other things. The opportunity of improvement of the health      status is the main advantage of the sport for disabled people (53%). The chance      of self-testing and sport competition was pointed out by 47% of subjects. The      most common reason for taking up sport activity was sport passion (over 50%). The      others were: possibility of creating new contacts with people, improvement of the      physical condition, chance of self-testing and passing free time (23%). The lack       of free time was the factor eliminating from sport activity in the second group      (28%). The other problem was the shortage of appropriate clubs, equipment,      infrastructure etc. (almost 25%). Students concluded that sport for disabled      people aims to improve the mental condition mainly (42%). Quite similar      percentage of the group (38%) didn't see any reason that was able to exclude the       handicapped from goingin for sport. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Not only does active going      in for sport improve the physical condition of the handicapped but strengthen      them psychically as well. (2) The lack of sport activity in disabled people is to      a high degree a result of low number of sport clubs, organisations, buildings as       well as presence of architectural barriers.FAU - Plinta, RyszardAU  - Plinta RAD  - Studium Wychowania Fizycznego i Sportu Slaskiej Akademii Medycznej w Katowicach.FAU - Sobiecka, JoannaAU  - Sobiecka JLA  - polPT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticleTT  - Aspekty warunkujace podjicie aktywnosci sportowej przez osoby niepelnosprawne.PL  - PolandTA  - Wiad LekJT  - Wiadomosci lekarskie (Warsaw, Poland : 1960)JID - 9705467SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - Architectural Accessibility/standardsMH  - *Attitude to HealthMH  - Competitive BehaviorMH  - Disabled Persons/psychology/rehabilitation/*statistics & numerical dataMH  - Exercise/physiology/psychologyMH  - HumansMH  - Leisure Activities/psychologyMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - MotivationMH  - *Physical Education and TrainingMH  - *Physical Fitness/psychologyMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Sports/psychology/*statistics & numerical dataEDAT- 2007/05/04 09:00MHDA- 2007/07/28 09:00CRDT- 2007/05/04 09:00PST - ppublishSO  - Wiad Lek. 2002;55 Suppl 1(Pt 2):864-9.PMID- 17473783OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20070502DCOM- 20070614LR  - 20081121IS  - 0195-9131 (Print)IS  - 0195-9131 (Linking)VI  - 39IP  - 3DP  - 2007 MarTI  - American College of Sports Medicine position stand. Exertional heat illness      during training and competition.PG  - 556-72AB  - Exertional heat illness can affect athletes during high-intensity or      long-duration exercise and result in withdrawal from activity or collapse during       or soon after activity. These maladies include exercise associated muscle      cramping, heat exhaustion, or exertional heatstroke. While certain individuals      are more prone to collapse from exhaustion in the heat (i.e., not acclimatized,      using certain medications, dehydrated, or recently ill), exertional heatstroke      (EHS) can affect seemingly healthy athletes even when the environment is      relatively cool. EHS is defined as a rectal temperature greater than 40 degrees C      accompanied by symptoms or signs of organ system failure, most frequently central      nervous system dysfunction. Early recognition and rapid cooling can reduce both      the morbidity and mortality associated with EHS. The clinical changes associated       with EHS can be subtle and easy to miss if coaches, medical personnel, and      athletes do not maintain a high level of awareness and monitor at-risk athletes      closely. Fatigue and exhaustion during exercise occur more rapidly as heat stress      increases and are the most common causes of withdrawal from activity in hot      conditions. When athletes collapse from exhaustion in hot conditions, the term      heat exhaustion is often applied. In some cases, rectal temperature is the only      discernable difference between severe heat exhaustion and EHS in on-site      evaluations. Heat exhaustion will generally resolve with symptomatic care and      oral fluid support. Exercise associated muscle cramping can occur with exhaustive      work in any temperature range, but appears to be more prevalent in hot and humid       conditions. Muscle cramping usually responds to rest and replacement of fluid and      salt (sodium). Prevention strategies are essential to reducing the incidence of      EHS, heat exhaustion, and exercise associated muscle cramping.CN  - American College of Sports MedicineFAU - Armstrong, Lawrence EAU  - Armstrong LEFAU - Casa, Douglas JAU  - Casa DJFAU - Millard-Stafford, MindyAU  - Millard-Stafford MFAU - Moran, Daniel SAU  - Moran DSFAU - Pyne, Scott WAU  - Pyne SWFAU - Roberts, William OAU  - Roberts WOLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Med Sci Sports ExercJT  - Medicine and science in sports and exerciseJID - 8005433SB  - IMSB  - SMH  - Competitive Behavior/*physiologyMH  - Heat Exhaustion/*etiologyMH  - Heat Stress Disorders/*etiologyMH  - HumansMH  - *Motor ActivityMH  - Physical Endurance/*physiologyMH  - Physical Exertion/*physiologyMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Societies, MedicalMH  - Sports/*physiologyMH  - Sports MedicineMH  - United StatesRF  - 177EDAT- 2007/05/03 09:00MHDA- 2007/06/15 09:00CRDT- 2007/05/03 09:00AID - 10.1249/MSS.0b013e31802fa199 [doi]AID - 00005768-200703000-00020 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Med Sci Sports Exerc. 2007 Mar;39(3):556-72.PMID- 17472061OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20070502DCOM- 20070627IS  - 0035-7715 (Print)IS  - 0035-7715 (Linking)VI  - 57 SupplDP  - 2006TI  - [Students' opinions of the Academy of Physical Education and Sports from Gdansk      about their preparation for pro-health education program at school].PG  - 43-6AB  - The object of the study was to collect opinions on preparations for prohealth      education program at school presented by students from Gdansk.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: The survey was      administered at coaches' meetings, following practices, and via mail.      PARTICIPANTS: 156 active youth sports coaches, with 5.88 +/- 3.16 years (range      1-22) of coaching experience. INTERVENTIONS: An original survey instrument      developed to assess concussion knowledge. Internal validity of the instrument was      established prior to the study (Cronbach's alpha = 0.83). MAIN OUTCOME      MEASUREMENTS: Scores on the survey instrument reflecting symptom recognition and       management knowledge. RESULTS: For the 16 items comprising the symptom      recognition survey, the mean number of correct responses was 9.78 +/- 2.07.      Previous coaching education was predictive of better symptom recognition. On the       true/false portion, between 49.4% and 61.5% of coaches correctly answered the 4      statements. CONCLUSION: This investigation revealed that, among youth sports      coaches, coaching education was predictive of the ability to recognize signs and       symptoms of sport-related concussion. However, several misconceptions about      concussion still exist, highlighting that education regarding concussion is      necessary. The presence of qualified health care personnel, such as an athletic      trainer, at the youth organization level may enhance early recognition,      treatment, and referral of concussions.FAU - Valovich McLeod, Tamara CAU  - Valovich McLeod TCFAU - Schwartz, ChristianAU  - Schwartz CFAU - Bay, R CurtisAU  - Bay RCLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - United StatesTA  - Clin J Sport MedJT  - Clinical journal of sport medicine : official journal of the Canadian Academy of       Sport MedicineJID - 9103300SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Athletic Injuries/*diagnosisMH  - Brain Concussion/*diagnosisMH  - Cross-Sectional StudiesMH  - Health EducationMH  - HumansMH  - Middle AgedMH  - *Professional CompetenceMH  - QuestionnairesEDAT- 2007/04/07 09:00MHDA- 2007/05/26 09:00CRDT- 2007/04/07 09:00AID - 10.1097/JSM.0b013e31803212ae [doi]AID - 00042752-200703000-00009 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Clin J Sport Med. 2007 Mar;17(2):140-2.PMID- 17369092OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20070827DCOM- 20071207IS  - 1440-2440 (Print)VI  - 10IP  - 5DP  - 2007 OctTI  - Priorities for reducing the burden of injuries in sport: the example of      Australian football.PG  - 273-6AB  - The promotion of safe sports participation has become a public health issue due      to rising obesity rates and the potential for parental concerns about safety to      inhibit sports participation. The safety of Australian football and its elite      game, the Australian Football League (AFL), is often the focus of media      commentary. Participation in the modified version of the game (Auskick) has been       shown to be safer but by the time children reach the under-15 age group, adult      rules are in place and the umbrella of safety provided by modified rules is gone.      Figures released recently by the AFL suggest that injury rates at the elite-level      are at an historical low, but equivalent information for the more than 400,000      non-elite participants is not available. Published literature related to      preventing injuries in Australian football highlights a significant knowledge gap      with respect to the aetiology of injuries in non-elite participants and only a      very small evidence base for prevention of injuries in this sport. Gains in      reducing the public health impact of football injuries, and injury-related      barriers to Australian football participation, will only come from substantial      investment in large-scale trials at the non-elite level, and a co-ordinated and      multidisciplinary approach to dealing with safety and injury issues across all      levels of play. Active and committed collaboration of key stakeholders such as      government health agencies, peak sports bodies, sports administrators,      clinicians, researchers, clubs, coaches and the participants themselves will be      necessary.FAU - Gabbe, Belinda JAU  - Gabbe BJAD  - Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Australia.      belinda.gabbe@med.monash.edu.auFAU - Finch, Caroline FAU  - Finch CFFAU - Cameron, Peter AAU  - Cameron PALA  - engPT  - EditorialPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20070321PL  - AustraliaTA  - J Sci Med SportJT  - Journal of science and medicine in sport / Sports Medicine AustraliaJID - 9812598SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Athletic Injuries/*prevention & controlMH  - AustraliaMH  - ChildMH  - Evidence-Based MedicineMH  - HumansMH  - Public HealthMH  - Soccer/*injuriesEDAT- 2007/03/21 09:00MHDA- 2007/12/08 09:00CRDT- 2007/03/21 09:00PHST- 2006/12/12 [received]PHST- 2007/01/31 [revised]PHST- 2007/02/07 [accepted]PHST- 2007/03/21 [aheadofprint]AID - S1440-2440(07)00031-X [pii]AID - 10.1016/j.jsams.2007.02.001 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sci Med Sport. 2007 Oct;10(5):273-6.

Many men are socialized and participate in sport discourses that promote certain       truths about being a man that often have detrimental effects to their health. The      capacity of research to inform men's construction of health is limited. In an      attempt to engage male participants within the research process and cause a form       of catalytic validity, transcripts from interviews with the men were analyzed,      and thematic findings were represented in a poetic form and shared with the      participants for discussion and refinement. The findings revealed how the male      participants reiterated messages that the media promotes, such as the importance       of physical and mental strength for a man. More significantly, the men became      aware that they assumed a narrow definition of health portrayed by professional      athletics that perpetuated a hegemonic masculinity. Reflections on changes in the      men's lifestyle choices after engaging in the research process are offered in the      conclusion.FAU - Madill, LeannaAU  - Madill LAD  - Department of Curriculum and Instruction, Faculty of Education, University of      Victoria, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. lmadill@uvic.caFAU - Hopper, Timothy FAU  - Hopper TFLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Am J Mens HealthJT  - American journal of men's healthJID - 101287723SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Famous PersonsMH  - HumansMH  - Life StyleMH  - MaleMH  - *MasculinityMH  - Men's HealthMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Physical FitnessMH  - Poetry as TopicMH  - Qualitative ResearchMH  - *SocializationMH  - Sports/*psychologyMH  - Young AdultEDAT- 2007/03/01 00:00MHDA- 2010/01/16 06:00CRDT- 2009/06/02 09:00AID - 1/1/44 [pii]AID - 10.1177/1557988306294604 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Am J Mens Health. 2007 Mar;1(1):44-59. doi: 10.1177/1557988306294604.PMID- 17324662OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20070227DCOM- 20070423LR  - 20081121IS  - 0002-8223 (Print)IS  - 0002-8223 (Linking)VI  - 107IP  - 3DP  - 2007 MarTI  - Participation in weight-related sports is associated with higher use of      unhealthful weight-control behaviors and steroid use.PG  - 434-40AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether adolescents who participate in a weight-related      sport are at increased risk for unhealthful weight-control behaviors and steroid       use. DESIGN: This was a population-based study (Project EAT [Eating Among      Teens]). SUBJECTS/SETTING: Subjects were 4,746 adolescents (50.2% males, 49.8%      females) from 31 public middle and high schools in the Minneapolis/St Paul area      of Minnesota. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PERFORMED: Descriptive statistics, chi2      analyses, and multiple logistic regression were used. Data were adjusted for      sociodemographic variables and body mass index. MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLES:      Unhealthful weight-control behaviors and steroid use. RESULTS: More males (20.4%)      than females (16.2%) reported participation in a weight-related sport. Males who       reported participation in a weight-related sport had an increased risk of      past-week vomiting (odds ratio [OR]=5.7), laxative use (OR=6.8), as well as      past-year vomiting (OR=4.9), laxative use (OR=3.4), diuretic use (OR=6.0), and      steroid use (OR=3.7), compared with those males who did not report participation.      Females who reported participation in a weight-related sport had an increased      risk of past week vomiting (OR=2.1), as well as past year vomiting (OR=2.0),      laxative use (OR=2.6), and steroid use (OR=2.6), compared with those who did not       report participation in a weight-related sport. CONCLUSIONS: The current study      shows that participation in a sport that adolescents perceive as emphasizing      weight is strongly associated with unhealthful weight-control behaviors and      steroid use. Preventive efforts, targeting parents, coaches, and adolescents are       needed to decrease this risk.FAU - Vertalino, MaggieAU  - Vertalino MAD  - Division of Epidemiology and Community Health, School of Public Health,      University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55454, USA.FAU - Eisenberg, Marla EAU  - Eisenberg MEFAU - Story, MaryAU  - Story MFAU - Neumark-Sztainer, DianneAU  - Neumark-Sztainer DLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.PL  - United StatesTA  - J Am Diet AssocJT  - Journal of the American Dietetic AssociationJID - 7503061RN  - 0 (Cathartics)RN  - 0 (Diuretics)RN  - 0 (Steroids)SB  - AIMSB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Adolescent BehaviorMH  - Adolescent Nutritional Physiological PhenomenaMH  - Body Mass IndexMH  - Body Weight/*physiologyMH  - Cathartics/*administration & dosageMH  - Chi-Square DistributionMH  - Diuretics/administration & dosageMH  - FemaleMH  - Food HabitsMH  - *Health BehaviorMH  - HumansMH  - Logistic ModelsMH  - MaleMH  - MinnesotaMH  - Odds RatioMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - *SportsMH  - Steroids/*administration & dosageMH  - Vomiting/*epidemiologyEDAT- 2007/02/28 09:00MHDA- 2007/04/24 09:00CRDT- 2007/02/28 09:00PHST- 2006/05/22 [received]AID - S0002-8223(06)02677-0 [pii]AID - 10.1016/j.jada.2006.12.010 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Am Diet Assoc. 2007 Mar;107(3):434-40.PMID- 17296067OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20070213DCOM- 20070323IS  - 0214-9915 (Print)IS  - 0214-9915 (Linking)VI  - 18IP  - 3DP  - 2006 AugTI  - [A new model of sportive cooperation and its evaluation by means a      questionnaire].PG  - 425-32AB  - We present in this paper the sportive cooperation as a theoretical framework for       the teams' dynamics, and as an alternative to others theories, specially the      sportive cohesion. This theory has a double basis: 1) The rational and      utilitarist decision taking upon the personal cooperation or not, with the team's      goal, based on the internal teammates interaction, and the environmental stimuli;      and 2) A personal, and more stable, disposition to cooperate, despite the      possibility of obtain any counterparts for this behavior. From this framework, we      have build--in a three phase process--a questionnaire addressed to evaluate the      sportive cooperation. The final version--composed of 15 items with standard      psychometric propierties--shows two kinds of factors. First, we have two      dispositional, traitlike, factors: The Conditional cooperation, and the      Unconditional cooperation. Second, we have three situational factors: the      Cooperation with the Coach, with the teammates, and the Cooperation outside the      game and the training. Lastly, we discuss the maining of this theory respect to      the sportive team's dynamics, and its relevance for the applied psychology, both       for the evaluation and the interventions on the teams.FAU - Garcia-Mas, AlexandreAU  - Garcia-Mas AAD  - Universitat de les Illes Balears, Palma, Spain. alex.garcia@uib.esFAU - Olmedilla, AurelioAU  - Olmedilla AFAU - Morilla, MiguelAU  - Morilla MFAU - Rivas, ClaudiaAU  - Rivas CFAU - Garcia Quintero, EvaAU  - Garcia Quintero EFAU - Ortega Toro, EnriqueAU  - Ortega Toro ELA  - spaPT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticleTT  - Un nuevo modelo de cooperacion deportiva y su evaluacion mediante un      cuestionario.PL  - SpainTA  - PsicothemaJT  - PsicothemaJID - 101189384SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - ChildMH  - *Cooperative BehaviorMH  - Feasibility StudiesMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - *QuestionnairesMH  - *SportsEDAT- 2007/02/14 09:00MHDA- 2007/03/24 09:00CRDT- 2007/02/14 09:00PST - ppublishSO  - Psicothema. 2006 Aug;18(3):425-32.PMID- 17295985OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20070213DCOM- 20070313IS  - 0214-9915 (Print)IS  - 0214-9915 (Linking)VI  - 19IP  - 1DP  - 2007 FebTI  - Youth sport dropout from the achievement goal theory.PG  - 65-71AB  - This study examined dropout behavior, using the conceptual framework of      achievement goal theory. We hypothesized that dropout could be predicted by a      high ego-oriented goal disposition in combination with a low perception of      personal skill and the perception that the coach and sport peers maintained      ego-oriented sport success criteria. The participants were 134 adolescent      athletes involved in high-level competitive sports participation. The results of       structural equation modeling (SEM) supported these hypotheses. Furthermore, the      variables that directly predicted sport dropout were the participant's ego      orientation (positively) and perception of skill (negatively).

METHODS: Cross-sectional survey of 451 high school      athletes participating on girls and boys track and boys soccer teams in five      public high schools in Seattle, WA, spring 2005. Questions were modified from      validated surveys of physical activity for adolescents. The main outcome measure       was meeting criteria for adequate preseason conditioning, which specify a      combination of aerobic conditioning (vigorous exercise for at least 300 min x      wk(-1)) and stretching and strengthening exercises (at least three times a week      for any duration). Log-binomial regression was performed to examine factors      associated with preseason conditioning. RESULTS: The majority of athletes met the      criteria for each of the components (59% for aerobic conditioning, 62% for      stretching, 63% for strengthening). As defined by meeting the criteria for all      three components, 33% of the athletes had adequate preseason conditioning. Of      those athletes meeting criteria for all three components, the majority reported      at least 1 month of conditioning to prepare for the season. Varsity athletes were      more likely to meet the preseason conditioning criteria compared with junior      varsity athletes (38 vs 25%, prevalence ratio 1.5, 95% CI 1.0-2.1). Athletes who       reported help with conditioning from a coach were twice as likely to have      adequate preseason conditioning compared with those who did not receive help from      a coach (45 vs 23%, prevalence ratio 1.8, 95% CI 1.3-2.4). CONCLUSION: The      majority of athletes in this study did meet criteria for each individual      conditioning component (aerobic, stretching, strengthening), but only a minority       met all three criteria. These findings highlight the need for school- or      coach-sponsored involvement to ensure that all athletes engage in comprehensive      preseason conditioning programs.FAU - Brooks, M AlisonAU  - Brooks MAAD  - Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholars Program, University of Washington, Seattle,      WA, USA. ma.brooks@hosp.wisc.eduFAU - Schiff, Melissa AAU  - Schiff MAFAU - Koepsell, Thomas DAU  - Koepsell TDFAU - Rivara, Frederick PAU  - Rivara FPLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - United StatesTA  - Med Sci Sports ExercJT  - Medicine and science in sports and exerciseJID - 8005433SB  - IMSB  - SMH  - AdolescentMH  - BelgiumMH  - Cross-Sectional StudiesMH  - ExerciseMH  - *Exercise TestMH  - FemaleMH  - Health SurveysMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Muscle Strength/physiologyMH  - Muscle Stretching ExercisesMH  - Physical Fitness/*physiologyMH  - PrevalenceMH  - *SchoolsMH  - SeasonsMH  - Soccer/*physiologyMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Track and Field/*physiologyEDAT- 2007/02/06 09:00MHDA- 2007/04/11 09:00CRDT- 2007/02/06 09:00AID - 10.1249/01.mss.0000246997.02095.5b [doi]AID - 00005768-200702000-00005 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Med Sci Sports Exerc. 2007 Feb;39(2):241-7.PMID- 17272311OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20070524DCOM- 20070709LR  - 20140907IS  - 1473-0480 (Electronic)IS  - 0306-3674 (Linking)VI  - 41IP  - 6DP  - 2007 JunTI  - Influence of moderate dehydration on soccer performance: physiological responses       to 45 min of outdoor match-play and the immediate subsequent performance of      sport-specific and mental concentration tests.PG  - 385-91AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether moderate water loss (approximately 1.5-2% of body      mass (BM)) represents a significant impairment to soccer match-play and the      related fitness variables. METHODS: 11 moderately active male soccer players      (mean (SD) age 24.4 (3) years, BM 74.03 (10.5) kg, peak oxygen consumption 50.91       (4.0) ml/kg/min) volunteered to participate. The experimental procedure      comprised: (1) a 45 min pre-match period of cycle ergometry exercise (90% of      individual ventilatory threshold); (2) the completion of a 45 min soccer match;      and (3) the immediate post-match performance of sport-specific and mental      concentration tests. The subjects completed the procedure on three occasions each      in a different experimental condition (fluid intake (FL), no fluid (NF) and mouth      rinse (MR)) in an individually randomised order. Core temperature (Tc), heart      rates, plasma and urine osmolalities, BM, sweat rates and heat storage were all      measured. RESULTS: The only condition-dependent difference during the match-play       element of the protocol was a significantly increased Tc in the NF condition      compared with the FL condition (39.28 degrees C (0.35 degrees C) and 38.8 degrees      C (0.47 degrees C), respectively; p<0.05). The immediate post-match performance      of a sport-specific fitness test was significantly impaired where FL had been      denied (p<0.01). The post-test evaluation of rating of perceived exertion and      thirst indicated that the NF condition was perceived to be the most challenging      (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The condition-dependent differences in match-play and      post-match tests demonstrate that moderate dehydration is detrimental to soccer      performance. However, it remains unclear whether this could be attributable to      water loss in itself or the negative psychological associations derived from a      greater perception of effort in that condition.FAU - Edwards, Andrew MAU  - Edwards AMAD  - Leeds Metropolitan University, Carnegie Research Institute, Leeds, UK.      a.m.edwards@ucol.ac.nzFAU - Mann, Michael EAU  - Mann MEFAU - Marfell-Jones, Michael JAU  - Marfell-Jones MJFAU - Rankin, Dean MAU  - Rankin DMFAU - Noakes, Timothy DAU  - Noakes TDFAU - Shillington, David PAU  - Shillington DPLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20070201PL  - EnglandTA  - Br J Sports MedJT  - British journal of sports medicineJID - 0432520SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Attention/*physiologyMH  - Body TemperatureMH  - Body Weight/physiologyMH  - Cross-Over StudiesMH  - DrinkingMH  - Exercise/*physiologyMH  - Heart RateMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Osmolar ConcentrationMH  - Plasma/chemistryMH  - Soccer/*physiologyMH  - Task Performance and AnalysisMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Urine/chemistryMH  - Water Loss, Insensible/*physiologyPMC - PMC2465308OID - NLM: PMC2465308EDAT- 2007/02/03 09:00MHDA- 2007/07/10 09:00CRDT- 2007/02/03 09:00PHST- 2007/02/01 [aheadofprint]PHST- 2007/02/08 [aheadofprint]AID - bjsm.2006.033860 [pii]AID - 10.1136/bjsm.2006.033860 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Br J Sports Med. 2007 Jun;41(6):385-91.

A questionnaire was prepared and administered to the involved sample.      Classes took part in this study through randomized selection and data were      analyzed using program Epi Info 6. Most of the respondents (60.1%) stay involved       in sport because "it makes me feel good" and 32.4% because sport is "enjoyable      and entertaining". Pre-adolescents chose the sport in which they become engaged      on the basis of personal inclination (40%), in order to share experiences and      their free time with friends (15.4%); 13.7% declare to prefer sport to be      practiced in team. (13.7%). The most practiced sport are: football (51.3% boys,      4.5% girls), volley (3.9%-36.4%), dance (0.8%-25.2%) e swimming (9.4%-14%). 80.8%      in the sample practice physical activity in settings outside schools and, among      these, 51.7% dedicate three or more hours weekly to extra-school activities.      There are significant differences (p < 0.05) between males' and females'      engagement in physical activity (mean value: 4.1 hours; males: 4.6 h, females:      3.5 h). Among pre-teens, 18% declare to be physically inactive at all; 15.7% do      not take part in sport activities because afraid to be bullied or shamed by      peers. Research show that males are significantly more involved in physical      activity than females.FAU - Schieppati, SAU  - Schieppati SAD  - Scuola di Specializzazione in Igiene e Medicina Preventiva, Universita degli      Studi di Milano.FAU - Rossetti, EAU  - Rossetti EFAU - Piatti, AAU  - Piatti AFAU - Fonte, LAU  - Fonte LFAU - Pesenti, EAU  - Pesenti EFAU - Zecca, GAU  - Zecca GFAU - Lattuada, MAU  - Lattuada MFAU - Candela, AAU  - Candela AFAU - Valagussa, FAU  - Valagussa FFAU - Pellai, AAU  - Pellai ALA  - itaPT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Multicenter StudyTT  - I preadolescenti e lo sport: risultati di un'indagine in alcune scuole medie      dell'area brianzola.PL  - ItalyTA  - Ann IgJT  - Annali di igiene : medicina preventiva e di comunitaJID - 9002865SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - ChildMH  - FemaleMH  - Health BehaviorMH  - Health SurveysMH  - HumansMH  - ItalyMH  - MaleMH  - MotivationMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - SchoolsMH  - Sports/*statistics & numerical dataMH  - Students/*statistics & numerical dataEDAT- 2007/01/19 09:00MHDA- 2007/02/15 09:00CRDT- 2007/01/19 09:00PST - ppublishSO  - Ann Ig. 2006 Nov-Dec;18(6):535-42.PMID- 17165417OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20061214DCOM- 20070212LR  - 20070824IS  - 0031-5125 (Print)IS  - 0031-5125 (Linking)VI  - 103IP  - 2DP  - 2006 OctTI  - Perceived verbal aggressiveness of coaches in volleyball and basketball: a      preliminary study.PG  - 526-30AB  - This study examined verbal aggressiveness of coaches as perceived by their      athletes, 108 senior athletes (57 boys and 51 girls) ages 15-19 years.

The sample consisted of volleyball athletes (n=208; 98 men and 110 women) and      their coaches (n=20; 16 men and 4 women). Analysis showed that male volleyball      players rated somatic anxiety higher and were more affected by the verbal      aggressiveness of their coaches than female volleyball players. No mean      differences were significant for male and female coaches on somatic or cognitive       anxiety, self-confidence, or verbal aggressiveness. Also, correlation between      subscale scores for male and female volleyball players and coaches was found. The      correlations of verbal aggressiveness with self-confidence and anxiety were      positive for these athletes, leading them to better behavior.

Previous research has revealed that parents and coaches may give rise to       both enjoyable and stressful sport experiences for the pediatric athlete and that      parents and coaches are thus able to influence whether young people decide to      quit sport or continue participating. Less is known about the relation of      supportive versus pressuring parental and coach behaviors on the quality of      athletes' achievement striving, relationships to friends in sport, and their      competence perceptions. Such knowledge may help create a better psychological      sport experience for pediatric athletes. DATA SOURCES/SYNTHESIS: A      questionnaire-based cross-sectional field study was carried out among 677 young      Norwegian soccer players (aged 10 to 14 years; 504 boys, 173 girls; mean age:      boys = 11.9 years, SD = 2.9; girls = 11.2 years, SD = 2.1) taking part in the      Norway Cup international youth soccer tournament in 2001. Multivariate analysis      of variance (MANOVA) with follow-up canonical correlation was used to examine      multivariate relationships between supportive and pressuring behavior and      athletes' psychosocial experiences. RESULTS: Joint pressuring behaviors from      parents and coaches related positively to maladaptive achievement striving, as      indicated by overconcern for mistakes, doubt about one's soccer actions, and      lowered perceptions of soccer competence. Mirroring these findings, predominantly      supportive coach-created psychological climates were related to a linear pattern       of psychological outcomes comprising high-quality friendships, positive      competency perceptions, and the absence of specific worries related to      achievement striving. CONCLUSIONS: Supportive, mastery-oriented coach influence      seems beneficial for constructive psychosocial outcomes in pediatric athletes,      and athletes experiencing a joint social pressure to excel from coaches and      parents may benefit less psychosocially through sport.FAU - Ommundsen, YngvarAU  - Ommundsen YAD  - Norwegian School of Sport Sciences, Oslo, Norway. yngvar.ommundsen@nih.noFAU - Roberts, Glyn CAU  - Roberts GCFAU - Lemyre, Pierre-NicolasAU  - Lemyre PNFAU - Miller, Blake WAU  - Miller BWLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Clin J Sport MedJT  - Clinical journal of sport medicine : official journal of the Canadian Academy of       Sport MedicineJID - 9103300SB  - IMMH  - AchievementMH  - AdolescentMH  - ChildMH  - *Competitive BehaviorMH  - Cross-Sectional StudiesMH  - FemaleMH  - FriendsMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - NorwayMH  - *Parent-Child RelationsMH  - Self ConceptMH  - Soccer/*psychologyMH  - Sports/*psychologyMH  - *Stress, PsychologicalEDAT- 2006/11/23 09:00MHDA- 2007/02/03 09:00CRDT- 2006/11/23 09:00AID - 10.1097/01.jsm.0000248845.39498.56 [doi]AID - 00042752-200611000-00009 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Clin J Sport Med. 2006 Nov;16(6):522-6.PMID- 17095937OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20061110DCOM- 20070130LR  - 20081121IS  - 0195-9131 (Print)IS  - 0195-9131 (Linking)VI  - 38IP  - 11DP  - 2006 NovTI  - American College of Sports Medicine position stand: prevention of cold injuries      during exercise.PG  - 2012-29AB  - It is the position of the American College of Sports Medicine that exercise can      be performed safely in most cold-weather environments without incurring      cold-weather injuries. The key to prevention is use of a comprehensive risk      management strategy that: a) identifies/assesses the cold hazard; b)      identifies/assesses contributing factors for cold-weather injuries; c) develops      controls to mitigate cold stress/strain; d) implements controls into formal      plans; and e) utilizes administrative oversight to ensure controls are enforced      or modified. The American College of Sports Medicine recommends that: 1)      coaches/athletes/medical personnel know the signs/symptoms and risk factors for      hypothermia, frostbite, and non-freezing cold injuries, identify individuals      susceptible to cold injuries, and have the latest up-to-date information about      current and future weather conditions before conducting training sessions or      competitions; 2) cold-weather clothing be chosen based on each individual's      requirements and that standardized clothing ensembles not be mandated for entire       groups; 3) the wind-chill temperature index be used to estimate the relative risk      of frostbite and that heightened surveillance of exercisers be used at wind-chill      temperatures below -27 degrees C (-18 degrees F); and 4) individuals with asthma       and cardiovascular disease can exercise in cold environments, but should be      monitored closely.FAU - Castellani, John WAU  - Castellani JWFAU - Young, Andrew JAU  - Young AJFAU - Ducharme, Michel BAU  - Ducharme MBFAU - Giesbrecht, Gordon GAU  - Giesbrecht GGFAU - Glickman, EllenAU  - Glickman EFAU - Sallis, Robert EAU  - Sallis RECN  - American College of Sports MedicineLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Practice GuidelinePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Med Sci Sports ExercJT  - Medicine and science in sports and exerciseJID - 8005433SB  - IMSB  - SMH  - Adaptation, PhysiologicalMH  - Athletic Injuries/physiopathology/*prevention & controlMH  - Cold Temperature/*adverse effectsMH  - Frostbite/physiopathology/*prevention & controlMH  - HumansMH  - Hypothermia/physiopathology/*prevention & controlMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Shivering/physiologyMH  - Vasoconstriction/physiologyMH  - Vasodilation/physiologyRF  - 197EDAT- 2006/11/11 09:00MHDA- 2007/01/31 09:00CRDT- 2006/11/11 09:00AID - 10.1249/01.mss.0000241641.75101.64 [doi]AID - 00005768-200611000-00019 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Med Sci Sports Exerc. 2006 Nov;38(11):2012-29.PMID- 17062653OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20061222DCOM- 20070319LR  - 20140907IS  - 1473-0480 (Electronic)IS  - 0306-3674 (Linking)VI  - 41IP  - 1DP  - 2007 JanTI  - Blood tests in tired elite athletes: expectations of athletes, coaches and sport       science/sports medicine staff.PG  - 41-4AB  - BACKGROUND: The issue of the expectations of elite athletes, their coaches and      non-medically qualified athlete support staff of consultations with sports      physicians has not been previously dealt with in the sports medicine literature.       As fulfillment of expectations of the content of a consultation may influence      patient's satisfaction and clinical outcome, it is important to assess the      expectations of athletes and, most importantly, coaches. OBJECTIVE: To assess the      expectations and beliefs about fatigue, particularly in relation to blood tests,       of athletes, their coaches and support staff in the specific context of tiredness      of <7 days' duration. SUBJECTS: 28 senior sports science or non-medically      qualified sports medicine staff, 22 elite coaches and 62 elite athletes from the       Australian Institute of Sport were included in this study. METHODS: A single      questionnaire. RESULTS: The expectation for a blood test at the initial      consultation for short-term fatigue was particularly high among athletes (81%)      and coaches (91%). This expectation increased in athletes if their performance      was worsening. All groups unanimously suggested that a blood test be performed in      cases of more prolonged fatigue. Increase in total training load was perceived to      be the most important cause of fatigue, but issues relating to sleep were also      thought to be highly relevant. All groups suggested that blood tests provide some      degree of reassurance, and all groups suggested that the most important blood      tests that might be performed related to exclusion of iron deficiency, anaemia      and infection. CONCLUSION: Athletes and their coaches generally expect that blood      tests will be performed even when fatigue has been present for <1 week. This is      at odds with currently available evidence of the diagnostic utility of these      tests. Despite the current evidence base, individual factors in the athletes,      coaches and doctors need to be considered when deciding on whether such testing      has to be performed.FAU - Fallon, K EAU  - Fallon KEAD  - Department of Sports Medicine, Australian Institute of Sport, PO Box 176,      Belconnen 2616, Canberra, Australia. fallonk@ausport.gov.auLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20061024PL  - EnglandTA  - Br J Sports MedJT  - British journal of sports medicineJID - 0432520SB  - IMMH  - AttitudeMH  - AustraliaMH  - Fatigue/*blood/etiologyMH  - HumansMH  - Prospective StudiesMH  - *SportsPMC - PMC2465134OID - NLM: PMC2465134EDAT- 2006/10/26 09:00MHDA- 2007/03/21 09:00CRDT- 2006/10/26 09:00PHST- 2006/10/24 [aheadofprint]AID - bjsm.2006.030999 [pii]AID - 10.1136/bjsm.2006.030999 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Br J Sports Med. 2007 Jan;41(1):41-4.

High sporting exercise capacity before and       after cardiac transplantation].PG  - 586-92AB  - The case of a 45-year-old man is reported who was an active competitive sportsman      up to his 38th year. In fall of 1998, exercise limitation was noted. The      cardiologic work-up revealed dilated cardiomyopathy. In spite of intensive      medical therapy clinical course deteriorated within the next 3 years, cardiologic      findings and a follow-up in CPET (cardiopulmonary exercise testing) showed a      rapid decline. In May 2002, he was listed for cardiac transplantation. In August       2003, an orthotopic bicaval cardiac transplantation was performed at the      University of Gottingen, Germany. The patient was followed regularly in the      office. Physical exercise capacity increased significantly and he was able to      participate in the 10-km New Year's run of 2003. Since 2004, he has been working       very successfully as a coach for competitive swimmers. Based on CPET findings,      actual views and concepts regarding the pathophysiology and training of chronic      heart failure are discussed and the question is raised whether and in which      respect a sportive predisposition favors the clinical outcome.FAU - Brune, StephanAU  - Brune SAD  - Herz-Lungen Praxis, Harsefelderstrasse 6, 21680 Stade. brune@ewetwl.netFAU - Kroidl, Rolf FAU  - Kroidl RFLA  - gerPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticleTT  - Ironman und Htx.

Efficacy and acceptance among medical students are unknown. The       self-image of sports has changed from a traditional, competition-oriented way to       adventure, entertainment, wellness and health. Therefore changes of our curricula      to a practical oriented way of teaching are required. In this regard a new      curriculum was developed. The main focus, besides an interdisciplinary class in      sports medicine was to offer practical education in sports to the students.      METHODS: Efficacy and acceptance of the class were evaluated using a      questionnaire. 90 medical students (58 male, 32 female) were included into the      study . RESULTS: The interdisciplinary topics of the class were graded      positively. Most of the presentations were regarded as very useful for the future      practice. Empathy and commitment of the professor were keystones to good scores.       The "fun-factor" was the key for the success of the practical assignment.      Practical training was regarded as fundamental for a sports medicine class.      DISCUSSION: Evaluation of the new concept as well as a discussion of the current       practice to teach sports medicine at medical school confirm the need of a more      practical oriented education, in order to meet the requirements of sports      medicine in a time with changing self image of sports.FAU - Roll, CAU  - Roll CFAU - Altenberger, HAU  - Altenberger HFAU - Gruber, HAU  - Gruber HFAU - Nerlich, MAU  - Nerlich MFAU - Kinner, BAU  - Kinner BLA  - gerPT  - EditorialPT  - English AbstractPT  - Evaluation StudiesTT  - Sportmedizinische Ausbildung von Medizinstudenten.

METHODS: A modified version of the State-Trait Anger      Expression Inventory was administered to 100 Italian adult male athletes      practicing rugby or individual combat sports (judo, freestyle wrestling, or      Greco-Roman wrestling). The questionnaire was intended to measure the frequency      and the direction (i.e., the facilitative-debilitative interpretation) of      competitive anger. RESULTS: Many athletes engaged in contact sports tended      interpret their competitive anger as facilitative of performance rather than      debilitative. The type of sport and the athlete's standard level can mediate the       individual's interpretation of the effects of anger symptoms upon performance.      CONCLUSIONS: Competitors can interpret their anger as helpful to energize      behavior and channel physical and mental resources for skill execution.      Practitioners should assist athletes in gaining control over anger rather than      attempting to suppress it.FAU - Robazza, BAU  - Robazza BAD  - Institute of Motor Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Surgery, University of      Padua, Padua, Italy. claudio.robazza@unipd.itFAU - Bertollo, MAU  - Bertollo MFAU - Bortoli, LAU  - Bortoli LLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - ItalyTA  - J Sports Med Phys FitnessJT  - The Journal of sports medicine and physical fitnessJID - 0376337SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - Analysis of VarianceMH  - *AngerMH  - *Competitive BehaviorMH  - Football/psychologyMH  - HumansMH  - ItalyMH  - MaleMH  - Martial Arts/psychologyMH  - Motor SkillsMH  - Personality InventoryMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - *Sports/classification/psychologyMH  - Wrestling/psychologyEDAT- 2006/09/26 09:00MHDA- 2007/05/26 09:00CRDT- 2006/09/26 09:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Med Phys Fitness. 2006 Sep;46(3):501-8.PMID- 16998439OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20060925DCOM- 20070525IS  - 0022-4707 (Print)IS  - 0022-4707 (Linking)VI  - 46IP  - 3DP  - 2006 SepTI  - Measuring and predicting maximal aerobic power in international-level      intermittent sport athletes.PG  - 366-72AB  - AIM: The purpose of this study was to measure actual VO2max during the      multi-stage fitness test (MSFT) and to compare this with predicted values      obtained using previously established, commonly used methods. We also wanted to      determine a new and more accurate regression equation for the prediction of      VO2max in intermittent sport athletes. METHODS: Twenty-six, elite, male,      intermittent sport athletes performed the MSFT with oxygen uptake (VO2) and heart      rate (HR) measured throughout. Paired t-tests were used to compare measured      VO2max with predicted VO2max. Linear regression was used to determine the      equation for the prediction of VO2max from the total number of shuttles      completed. RESULTS: There were no differences between the two methods of      predicting VO2max, however, both predicted values (53.6+/-3.9 and 51.3+/-4 mL x      kg(-1) x min(-1)) were significantly lower (9.3% and 13.2%, respectively) than      measured VO2max (59.1+/-6.6 mL x kg(-1) x min(-1), P < 0.001). Correlations      between measured and predicted VO2max were similar for both prediction methods (r      = 0.61, P = 0.013 and r = 0.68 and P = 0.004). We present a new prediction      equation [Y (VO2max, mL x kg(-1) x min(-1)) = 0.38 x total number of shuttles      completed +25.98] (where R = 0.69; R2 = 0.48; SEE = 4.9 mL x kg(-1) x min(-1);      SEE% = 8.3) which provides a more valid method of predicting actual max in      intermittent sport athletes. CONCLUSIONS: A new regression equation to predict      VO2max in intermittent sport athletes has been established. Whilst some error in       predicting VO2max still exists, the new equation will provide coaches and      sport-scientists with a more suitable equation with which to predict VO2max in      intermittent sport athletes.FAU - Kilding, A EAU  - Kilding AEAD  - Division of Sport and Recreation, Faculty of Health and Environmental Sciences,      Auckland University of Technology, Auckland, New Zealand.

One hundred and twenty-one coaches and athletes      reported on their direct-perceptions and meta-perceptions of closeness,      commitment and complementarity (3 Cs; Jowett & Cockerill, 2002), and of      satisfaction with instruction, performance and external agents. There was      evidence of both empathic accuracy and assumed similarity in coaches' and      athletes' perceptions. Athletes were more accurate in identifying the specific      content of their coaches' feelings in terms of closeness. Athletes and coaches      from newly developed relationships displayed higher levels of empathic accuracy,       whereas female athletes displayed higher levels of assumed similarity. Moreover,       evidence suggested that athletes' and coaches' assumed similarity led to more      accurate perceptions.

Research evidence is presented in      terms of children's development in a number of domains: physical, lifestyle,      affective, social, and cognitive. The review suggests that PES have the potential      to make significant and distinctive contributions to development in each of these      domains. It is suggested that PES have the potential to make distinctive      contributions to the development of children's fundamental movement skills and      physical competences, which are necessary precursors of participation in later      lifestyle and sporting physical activities. They also, when appropriately      presented, can support the development of social skills and social behaviors,      self-esteem and proschool attitudes, and, in certain circumstances, academic and       cognitive development. The review also stresses that many of these benefits will       not necessarily result from participation, per se; the effects are likely to be      mediated by the nature of the interactions between students and their teachers,      parents, and coaches who work with them. Contexts that emphasize positive      experiences, characterized by enjoyment, diversity, and the engagement of all,      and that are managed by committed and trained teachers and coaches, and      supportive and informed parents, significantly influence the character of these      physical activities and increase the likelihood of realizing the potential      benefits of participation.FAU - Bailey, RichardAU  - Bailey RAD  - School of Education, Froebel College, Roehampton University, Roehampton Lane,      London SW15 5PU, UK. r.bailey@roehampton.ac.ukLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - J Sch HealthJT  - The Journal of school healthJID - 0376370SB  - IMSB  - NMH  - AdolescentMH  - ChildMH  - *Child DevelopmentMH  - HumansMH  - Life StyleMH  - Physical Education and Training/*organization & administrationMH  - *SchoolsMH  - *SportsRF  - 75EDAT- 2006/09/19 09:00MHDA- 2006/12/23 09:00CRDT- 2006/09/19 09:00AID - JOSH132 [pii]AID - 10.1111/j.1746-1561.2006.00132.x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sch Health. 2006 Oct;76(8):397-401.PMID- 16958219OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20060908DCOM- 20060926LR  - 20061115VI  - 52IP  - 4DP  - 2006TI  - [Sexual dimorphism of the psychophysiological indices in sportsmen of higher      qualification].PG  - 64-8AB  - To determine the influence of sexual dimorphism on mental characteristics in      elite athletes, 24 sportsmen (18-27 years old) (17 men and 7 women members of      Ukrainian National Judo Team), 20 sedentary men and 20 sedentary women (20-29      years old) were studied.

The use of mental training skills may be of      interest to the practicing physical medicine and rehabilitation professional in      the treatment of his or her patients. It is important that the physical medicine       professional recognize what sport or performance psychology represents within the      paradigm of psychologic interventions. Referring to an individual based on his or      her training (licensed psychologist versus mental training consultant) is      essential for the appropriate management of psychologic issues related to      performance. The issues related to the psychologic rehabilitation of the injured       athlete are of importance to the medical staff; the overview of affective      responses can assist in understanding the normal and adaptive responses of the      injured athlete. Finally, a brief description of a psychologist's role within a      sports medicine and rehabilitation practice is presented. The psychologic issues       that are present in the world of sport and elite performance are numerous, and      not all are mentioned in this article. Issues of eating disorders, substance      abuse, and psychologic health with athletes should be further explored within the      physical medicine and rehabilitation discipline as well as in the sports medicine      discipline. The ever-evolving psychologic dynamics of individuals involved in      sport and elite performance are intriguing and unique. A specialized knowledge      base, training, and experience in providing psychologic services are required to       treat this unique population. Counseling and clinical issues of the athlete and      elite performer require further attention in the realm of psychologic      interventions, including further exploration of the efficacy of interventions for      performance enhancement. The field of applied sport psychology may offer the      physical medicine professional a unique perspective into the care of patients who      are athletes and elite performers.FAU - Carr, Christopher MAU  - Carr CMAD  - Methodist Sports Medicine Center, Indianapolis, IN 46280, USA.      cmcarr@stvincent.orgLA  - engPT  - Historical ArticlePT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Phys Med Rehabil Clin N AmJT  - Physical medicine and rehabilitation clinics of North AmericaJID - 9102787SB  - IMMH  - Athletic Injuries/*rehabilitationMH  - ConsultantsMH  - GoalsMH  - History, 19th CenturyMH  - History, 20th CenturyMH  - HumansMH  - Sports/history/*psychologyRF  - 19EDAT- 2006/09/06 09:00MHDA- 2006/11/03 09:00CRDT- 2006/09/06 09:00AID - S1047-9651(06)00033-7 [pii]AID - 10.1016/j.pmr.2006.05.007 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Phys Med Rehabil Clin N Am. 2006 Aug;17(3):519-35.PMID- 16942551OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20060831DCOM- 20070108IS  - 1600-4469 (Print)IS  - 1600-4469 (Linking)VI  - 22IP  - 5DP  - 2006 OctTI  - Dental squash injuries - a survey among players and coaches in Switzerland,      Germany and France.PG  - 231-6AB  - Squash belongs to sporting activities with medium risk of causing dental trauma.       Because of high velocity, close body contact and the use of rackets the injury      potential in squash has increased. The aim of this work was to conduct a      comparative study between Switzerland, Germany and France on a number of issues:       the frequency of dental and facial injuries in squash, athletes' habits of      wearing mouthguards, as well as the general level of information about emergency       measures after a dental trauma and the resulting consequences. Using a      standardized questionnaire a total of 653 individuals, 600 squash players and      their 53 coaches, were interviewed. In each of the three countries 200 players      belonging to four different divisions (juniors, amateurs, semi-professionals and       professionals) were surveyed. Of these 653 interviewees 133 (20.4%) have already       observed a dental injury; 27 (4.5%) have experienced a dental trauma themselves.       Less than half of all interviewed players and coaches (47.6%) were aware of the      possibility of replanting avulsed teeth. Just 5.1% were familiar with the tooth      rescue kit. Only one individual wore a mouthguard. The results show that the area      of squash requires more information about prevention through sports associations,      coaches and dentists.FAU - Persic, RobertAU  - Persic RAD  - Social Dental Clinics, Basle, Switzerland.FAU - Pohl, YangoAU  - Pohl YFAU - Filippi, AndreasAU  - Filippi ALA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - DenmarkTA  - Dent TraumatolJT  - Dental traumatology : official publication of International Association for      Dental TraumatologyJID - 101091305SB  - DMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Analysis of VarianceMH  - ChildMH  - Eye Injuries/epidemiology/etiologyMH  - France/epidemiologyMH  - Germany/epidemiologyMH  - HumansMH  - Linear ModelsMH  - Lip/*injuriesMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Mouth Protectors/utilizationMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Racquet Sports/*injuriesMH  - Switzerland/epidemiologyMH  - Tooth Avulsion/epidemiology/etiology/therapyMH  - Tooth Injuries/*epidemiology/etiology/therapyEDAT- 2006/09/01 09:00MHDA- 2007/01/09 09:00CRDT- 2006/09/01 09:00AID - EDT379 [pii]AID - 10.1111/j.1600-9657.2006.00379.x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Dent Traumatol. 2006 Oct;22(5):231-6.PMID- 16927554OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20060824DCOM- 20061020LR  - 20061115IS  - 1660-9379 (Print)IS  - 1660-9379 (Linking)VI  - 2IP  - 74DP  - 2006 Jul 26TI  - [The bill of rights for children in sport: a tool to promote the health and      protect the child in sport].PG  - 1774-7AB  - The Bill of rights for children in sport was developed in response to the need      for prevention and protection of children practicing sport.

That is the reason why       the elaboration of psychophysiological diagnostics criteria for higher      qualification athletes was performed. BACKGROUND: The diagnostics of      psychophysiological functions obtains information on individual and typological      characteristics of higher neural system, peculiarities of forming and improvement      of special experience and indicators of fatigue and hypertension of athletes.      METHODS: The 26 higher qualification athletes (men), members of National team      (Judo) were examined. The psychophysiological and neurodynamic functions such as       functional mobility of nervous processes, strength of nervous processes, time      perception, attention volume, operational thinking coefficient and short-term      memory volume were registered by a computer system. The differential scale of      functional states of psychophysiological functions in athletes was elaborated.      RESULTS: The results of the investigation showed that 10 subjects had high      parameters of functional states of psychophysiological functions and 14 have the       intermediate level. The functional states of psychophysiological functions in      higher qualification athletes characterize the functional system responsible for       the results of sport. The optimization of the perception and information      processing using the short-term memory reflects the psychophysiological      compensatory mechanisms of a decline of visual perception and information      processing capability in athletes. CONCLUSIONS: The psychophysiological states in      higher qualification athletes are characterized by the functional system      responsible for the result of sport (Tab. 7, Ref. 13).FAU - Korobeynikov, GAU  - Korobeynikov GAD  - Department of psychophysiological diagnostics, State Research Institute of      Physical Culture and Sport, Kiev, Ukraine. dndifks@i.kiev.uaFAU - Rossokha, GAU  - Rossokha GFAU - Koniaeva, LAU  - Koniaeva LFAU - Medvedchuk, KAU  - Medvedchuk KFAU - Kulinich, IAU  - Kulinich ILA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - SlovakiaTA  - Bratisl Lek ListyJT  - Bratislavske lekarske listyJID - 0065324SB  - IMMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Mental ProcessesMH  - Psychomotor PerformanceMH  - PsychophysiologyMH  - Sports/*physiology/*psychologyMH  - Visual PerceptionEDAT- 2006/08/18 09:00MHDA- 2006/10/13 09:00CRDT- 2006/08/18 09:00PST - ppublishSO  - Bratisl Lek Listy. 2006;107(5):205-9.PMID- 16864359OWN - NLMSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINEDA  - 20060725DCOM- 20070628IS  - 1064-0266 (Print)IS  - 1064-0266 (Linking)VI  - 13IP  - 5DP  - 2005 Oct-DecTI  - NCAA coaches survey: the role of the coach in identifying and managing athletes      with disordered eating.PG  - 447-66AB  - The primary objective of the present study was to survey collegiate coaches with       respect to how female athletes with disordered eating or eating disorders are      identified, how coaches are involved, and the identification criteria used. An      additional objective was to determine how symptomatic athletes are managed      regarding treatment and sport participation. Participants were 2,894 coaches      representing 23 sports. Findings indicated that athletic trainers, teammates, and      coaches are frequently involved in identification. Eating disorder symptoms were       most often used to identify symptomatic athletes, and athletes from high-risk      sports were more often identified. Coaches rated symptoms as being serious, both       in terms of how they affect the athlete's health and her athletic performance,      with amenorrhea being a notable exception.

Survey participants      were between the ages of 18 and 45 and lived in the states of Arkansas,      California, Connecticut, Florida, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, New Jersey, New      Mexico, North Carolina, and Wisconsin. At the time of the women's interview, fish      and shellfish consumption information was obtained for children under 18 years of      age living in the household. One child (aged 2-17) from each household (1852) was      randomly selected to evaluate fish consumption among children. Based on maternal       recall, 84% of these children had consumed fish or shellfish at least once during      the previous 12 months. This percentage ranged from 73% in New Jersey to 94% in      Louisiana and was higher among children who lived with a licensed angler compared      to those who did not. Eight percent of the children ate fish and/or shellfish      more than twice a week. Of the total number of fish and shellfish meals eaten by       children, 67% was commercial finfish, 22% was shellfish, and 11% was sport-caught      finfish. Among those who ate fish, the average consumption rate was 47 meals per       year-slightly less than one meal per week. This consumption frequency rate varied      by state of residence ranging from 37 meals per year in Montana and Wisconsin to       62 in Florida. Because of these regional differences, the use of national average      fish consumption rates may over- or under-estimate consumption in localized      areas. This survey suggests that targeting information to women who eat fish may       also protect children; more than 80% of children have fish consumption patterns      that are similar to that of their mothers. Additional research and biomonitoring       is needed to improve our understanding of the risk and benefits associated with      childhood consumption of fish and shellfish.FAU - Imm, PamelaAU  - Imm PAD  - Division of Public Health, Wisconsin Department of Health and Family Services,      Madison, Wisconsin, USA. immpb@dhfs.state.wi.usFAU - Knobeloch, LyndaAU  - Knobeloch LFAU - Anderson, Henry AAU  - Anderson HALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.DEP - 20060710PL  - United StatesTA  - Environ ResJT  - Environmental researchJID - 0147621SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - AnimalsMH  - ChildMH  - Child, PreschoolMH  - *DietMH  - FemaleMH  - *Fish ProductsMH  - *FishesMH  - HumansMH  - Mental RecallMH  - Middle AgedMH  - MothersMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - SportsMH  - United StatesEDAT- 2006/07/11 09:00MHDA- 2007/03/23 09:00CRDT- 2006/07/11 09:00PHST- 2006/02/14 [received]PHST- 2006/05/01 [revised]PHST- 2006/05/18 [accepted]PHST- 2006/07/10 [aheadofprint]AID - S0013-9351(06)00133-2 [pii]AID - 10.1016/j.envres.2006.05.011 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Environ Res. 2007 Feb;103(2):198-204.

A total of 303 coaches (51% response rate) involved in six sports (i.e.,      gymnastics, swimming, basketball, softball, track, and volleyball) at all levels       of collegiate competition (NCAA Divisions I, II, III, and NAIA) completed a      40-item survey. Gender was found to be related to differential responding on only      one of the 40 items, while sport and level of competition were related to      responses on multiple items. Gymnastics coaches and NCAA Division I coaches      differed significantly from coaches of other sports and divisions in that they      reported more monitoring/management behaviors, had more experience with athletes       exhibiting eating disturbances, and had more resources available for preventing      and treating athletes with eating disorders. Gymnastics coaches also differed      from other coaches on a number of items related to their attitudes toward eating       and weight in the sport. Many coaches have encountered disturbed eating among      their athletes, and some of their coaching attitudes and behaviors may      inadvertently increase the risk for such disturbances.

We conclude that these rugby coaches were      inadequately prepared to impart nutrition advice to athletes and could benefit      from further nutrition training.FAU - Zinn, CarynAU  - Zinn CAD  - Auckland University of Technology, Auckland, New Zealand.FAU - Schofield, GrantAU  - Schofield GFAU - Wall, ClareAU  - Wall CLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - United StatesTA  - Int J Sport Nutr Exerc MetabJT  - International journal of sport nutrition and exercise metabolismJID - 100939812SB  - IMMH  - Analysis of VarianceMH  - AustraliaMH  - Body Weight/physiologyMH  - Dietary SupplementsMH  - Football/physiology/*psychologyMH  - *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, PracticeMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - *Nutritional Physiological PhenomenaMH  - Nutritional RequirementsMH  - PsychometricsMH  - Questionnaires/*standardsMH  - *Sports MedicineEDAT- 2006/06/20 09:00MHDA- 2006/08/01 09:00CRDT- 2006/06/20 09:00PST - ppublishSO  - Int J Sport Nutr Exerc Metab. 2006 Apr;16(2):214-25.PMID- 16778543OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20060616DCOM- 20061031LR  - 20061115IS  - 1050-642X (Print)IS  - 1050-642X (Linking)VI  - 16IP  - 3DP  - 2006 MayTI  - Pre-exercise stretching and sports related injuries: knowledge, attitudes and      practices.PG  - 228-31AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pre-exercise stretching (PES) has been common practice prior to      participation in athletic events. Despite evidence for lack of benefit, many      coaches continue to routinely instruct and prescribe stretching. This study      assesses the knowledge, attitudes and practices of high school coaches regarding       PES. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Multiple high schools in a      Southeast Michigan county. PARTICIPANTS: Head coaches (n = 71) at ten county high      schools completed the survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Knowledge, attitudes and      practices of high school coaches regarding PES. RESULTS: The survey was completed      by coaches at 10 of 11 public high schools with an overall response rate of 46%.       Coaches stretch athletes for an average of 13 minutes prior to practice or      competition. Almost 95% of coaches feel stretching is beneficial, specifically in      decreasing injury risk. Nearly 73% believe that there are no drawbacks to      stretching. The most significant reason cited for stretching is decreased injury       risk. Coaches stated that personal experience and scientific evidence are the two      factors that would most likely influence their future recommendations regarding      PES. There are statistically significant differences in stretching practices      between male and female coaches and experienced and inexperienced coaches.      CONCLUSIONS: Despite the lack of evidence, nearly all coaches believe that PES      prevents a wide array of injuries. Although coaches value personal experience in       determining their PES practices, they are open to new scientific evidence, which       should encourage the medical community to deliver current research.FAU - Shehab, RamseyAU  - Shehab RAD  - Department of Family Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-0239,       USA. rshehab@wfubmc.eduFAU - Mirabelli, MarkAU  - Mirabelli MFAU - Gorenflo, DanielAU  - Gorenflo DFAU - Fetters, Michael DAU  - Fetters MDLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Clin J Sport MedJT  - Clinical journal of sport medicine : official journal of the Canadian Academy of       Sport MedicineJID - 9103300SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Athletic Injuries/*prevention & controlMH  - Data CollectionMH  - Exercise/*physiologyMH  - FemaleMH  - *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, PracticeMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Muscle, Skeletal/physiologyEDAT- 2006/06/17 09:00MHDA- 2006/11/01 09:00CRDT- 2006/06/17 09:00AID - 00042752-200605000-00007 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Clin J Sport Med. 2006 May;16(3):228-31.PMID- 19114748OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20081230DCOM- 20100930IS  - 1555-0265 (Print)IS  - 1555-0265 (Linking)VI  - 1IP  - 2DP  - 2006 JunTI  - Sports-science roundtable: does sports-science research influence practice?PG  - 161-8AB  - As sports scientists, we claim to make a significant contribution to the body of       knowledge that influences athletic practice and performance. Is this the reality?      At the inaugural congress of the Australian Association for Exercise and Sports      Science, a panel of well-credentialed academic experts with experience in the      applied environment debated the question, Does sports-science research influence       practice? The first task was to define "sports-science research," and it was      generally agreed that it is concerned with providing evidence that improves      sports performance. When practices are equally effective, sports scientists also       have a role in identifying practices that are safer, more time efficient, and      more enjoyable. There were varying views on the need for sports-science research       to be immediately relevant to coaches or athletes. Most agreed on the importance       of communicating the results of sports-science research, not only to the academic      community but also to coaches and athletes, and the need to encourage both short-      and long-term research. The panelists then listed examples of sports-science      research that they believe have influenced practice, as well as strategies to      ensure that sports-science research better influences practice.FAU - Bishop, DavidAU  - Bishop DAD  - School of Human Movement and Exercise Science, University of Western Australia,      Crawley, Australia.FAU - Burnett, AngusAU  - Burnett AFAU - Farrow, DamianAU  - Farrow DFAU - Gabbett, TimAU  - Gabbett TFAU - Newton, RobertAU  - Newton RLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Int J Sports Physiol PerformJT  - International journal of sports physiology and performanceJID - 101276430SB  - IMCIN - Int J Sports Physiol Perform. 2007 Mar;2(1):3-4; author reply 4.

METHODS: Seventh and eighth grade students (N = 1692) completed a      questionnaire to measure sports program participation and factors that may      motivate continued participation in or attrition from sports. The psychometric      properties of the participation and attrition scales were tested using      gender-separate exploratory factor analysis. Analysis of variance (participation       status*gender) was used to identify differences in motivational factor scores and      physical activity variables. RESULTS: Eighty percent of the students were recent       participants (within the past year), 10% were former participants, and 10% had      never participated. For boys, the participation factors were labeled (in order)      competition, social benefits, and fitness. For girls, factor structures were      slightly different than the boys, which loaded as; social + skill benefits,      competition, and fitness. For both genders, lack of interest, coaching problems,       and time barriers were identified as attrition factors. Recent sport participants      reported more time in vigorous (p < .01), stretching (p = .03), and strengthening      activities (p < .01) and less time watching television (p < .01). CONCLUSIONS:      Gender-specific motivational factors exist for middle school youth; boys are more      attracted to the competitive aspects of sports whereas girls are more motivated      by the social opportunities that sports provide. Boys and girls who participate      in sports are more physically active, so it is important to develop programs that      children want to participate in and maximize retention.FAU - Sirard, John RAU  - Sirard JRAD  - Department of Exercise Science, University of South Carolina, Columbia, South      Carolina, USA. jsirard@stanford.eduFAU - Pfeiffer, Karin AAU  - Pfeiffer KAFAU - Pate, Russell RAU  - Pate RRLA  - engGR  - 5 T32 HL 07034/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - United StatesTA  - J Adolesc HealthJT  - The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for      Adolescent MedicineJID - 9102136SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - *Adolescent BehaviorMH  - ChildMH  - FemaleMH  - Health SurveysMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - *MotivationMH  - *Physical FitnessMH  - SchoolsMH  - Sex FactorsMH  - Social BehaviorMH  - *SportsEDAT- 2006/05/30 09:00MHDA- 2006/06/13 09:00CRDT- 2006/05/30 09:00PHST- 2004/09/09 [received]PHST- 2005/07/07 [revised]PHST- 2005/07/21 [accepted]AID - S1054-139X(05)00378-2 [pii]AID - 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2005.07.013 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Adolesc Health. 2006 Jun;38(6):696-703.PMID- 16718473OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20060921DCOM- 20070301IS  - 0340-6199 (Print)IS  - 0340-6199 (Linking)VI  - 165IP  - 11DP  - 2006 NovTI  - Improved perceived health status persists three months after a special sports      camp for children with congenital heart disease.PG  - 767-72AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although summer and sports camps for children with congenital heart      disease are organized in many countries and regions, empirical data on the      effects of such camps is limited. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to      investigate changes in the perceived health status and habitual physical      activities in children attending a special sports camp. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In      this longitudinal study, 25 children with congenital heart disease who      participated in a three-day multi-sports camp were included. The perceived health      status was measured using the Child Health Questionnaire-Child Form, CHQ-CF87,      completed by the child at the start of the camp (T1), at the end of the camp      (T2), and 3 months after the camp concluded (T3). Habitual physical activities      were assessed by means of a modified version of the Baecke questionnaire, which      was completed by one of the parents at T1 and T3. RESULTS: During the sports      camp, we observed significant improvements in the children's perception of their       physical functioning, role-physical functioning, general health, role-emotional      functioning, self-esteem, mental health, and general behavior. For physical      functioning, role-emotional functioning, and family activities, high scores      persisted three months after the sports camp concluded. The habitual physical      activities (sport and leisure time) of the children remained unchanged.      DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we propose that a special sports camp      for children with congenital heart disease may improve specific dimensions of      subjective health status. Our study confirms a previous report on the benefits of      such camps for afflicted children. If these findings can be further corroborated       in other settings, participation in sport camps should be advocated as a simple,       noninvasive means to promote healthier children.FAU - Moons, PhilipAU  - Moons PAD  - Center for Health Services and Nursing Research, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven,       Kapucijnenvoer 35/4, B-3000, Leuven, Belgium.

METHODS: A national survey of       132 United States junior tennis coaches was completed. The extent and      seriousness/impact of parent-child interaction problems and positive behaviours      were rated. RESULTS: Parents were perceived as very important for junior tennis      success. Most parents (59%) that these coaches had worked with were seen as      having a positive influence on their player's development. However, the      respondents also felt that 36% of parents negatively influenced their child's      development. Positive parental behaviours included providing logistical,      financial, and social-emotional support, as well as tennis opportunities and      unconditional love. Negative parent behaviours included overemphasising winning,       holding unrealistic expectations, and criticising their child. CONCLUSIONS:      Findings are discussed relative to current sport parenting and athletic talent      development research and theorising.

All 535 participants (M age = 24.9 yr., SD = 8.3) were      involved in sports at the time of the study as athletes (n = 342), referees (n =       145), or coaches (n = 48), and had a wide range of education. Analysis of      variance of scores on the Defining Issues Test of Rest showed moral judgment in      sports differs significantly amongst different age groups (F5.510 = 5.37, p <      .001) and amounts of education (F4.511 = 6.24, p < .001). Generally, with more      education, higher moral judgment can be expected. It is apparent that moral      development in sport is related to age and education, as also holds for a wider      social setting.FAU - Proios, MiltiadisAU  - Proios MAD  - Department of Physical Education and Sport Science, Aristotle University of      Thessaloniki, Greece.FAU - Doganis, GeorgeAU  - Doganis GLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Percept Mot SkillsJT  - Perceptual and motor skillsJID - 0401131SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - Age FactorsMH  - *Cooperative BehaviorMH  - Educational StatusMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - *JudgmentMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - *MoralsMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - *SportsEDAT- 2006/05/05 09:00MHDA- 2006/08/17 09:00CRDT- 2006/05/05 09:00AID - 10.2466/pms.102.1.247-253 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Percept Mot Skills. 2006 Feb;102(1):247-53.PMID- 16647605OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20060501DCOM- 20060720IS  - 0889-8545 (Print)IS  - 0889-8545 (Linking)VI  - 33IP  - 2DP  - 2006 JunTI  - Mental practice and acquisition of motor skills: examples from sports training      and surgical education.PG  - 297-304, ixAB  - Learning surgical skills involves both fine and gross motor skills, and      necessitates performance in stressful situations.

In the first part of this study, an eight-item questionnaire      was distributed to 22 coaches from 15 secondary schools randomly selected from      five municipalities of Ankara, Turkey. The questionnaire sought information on      how much coaches know regarding mouthguards and how often children and      adolescents of the ages 11-18 use mouthguards. The second part of the study was      based on the data obtained from direct interviews answered by 121 university      athletes of three different sport modalities (football, ice hockey and martial      arts). The purpose of this part of the study was to determine the rate of      mouthguard use and the frequency and type of oral trauma in these athletes. The      result of the coaches' questionnaires revealed that; none of the 11-18 years old       children and adolescents used mouthguards while participating in sports. Of the      coaches, 77.2% had seen orofacial trauma in this age group during sport      activities and 95.5% of the coaches believed that mouthguards prevented oral      injuries. Of the coaches, 72.7% reported that children and adolescents should use      mouthguards in sport activities. The second part of the study showed that      although all of the athletes owned mouth-formed type of mouthguards, the      utilization rate was 74.4%. Of all players, 13.2% had suffered from one or more      form of oral injury while not wearing mouthguards. The results show that in      Turkey, the use of mouthguards has not become widespread in sports. It can be      concluded that regular mouthguard use in sports should be encouraged in Turkey.FAU - Cetinbas, TugbaAU  - Cetinbas TAD  - Department of Pedodontics, Faculty of Dentistry, Ankara University, Ankara,      Turkey. cetintugba@yahoo.comFAU - Sonmez, HayriyeAU  - Sonmez HLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - DenmarkTA  - Dent TraumatolJT  - Dental traumatology : official publication of International Association for      Dental TraumatologyJID - 101091305SB  - DMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - Athletic Injuries/*prevention & control/psychologyMH  - ChildMH  - Health Knowledge, Attitudes, PracticeMH  - HumansMH  - Maxillofacial Injuries/*prevention & controlMH  - Mouth Protectors/*utilizationMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Sports EquipmentMH  - Tooth Injuries/*prevention & control/psychologyMH  - TurkeyEDAT- 2006/04/29 09:00MHDA- 2006/07/13 09:00CRDT- 2006/04/29 09:00AID - EDT397 [pii]AID - 10.1111/j.1600-9657.2006.00397.x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Dent Traumatol. 2006 Jun;22(3):127-32.PMID- 16621702OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20060508DCOM- 20060720IS  - 1440-2440 (Print)VI  - 9IP  - 1-2DP  - 2006 MayTI  - Assessment of player performance following return to sport after hamstring muscle      strain injury.PG  - 87-90AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if there is any decrease in playing performance of      athletes following return to sport after recovery from hamstring muscle strain      injury. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: One professional      Australian football team over two playing seasons. METHODS: For every game, the      team coach rated player performance proportional to time spent on the ground      playing (an integer score out of a maximum of 10). Player performance ratings      were compared pre- and post-hamstring muscle strain injury to assess player      performance upon return to sport. RESULTS: Thirteen athletes had hamstring      injuries and the required player ratings were available. The mean player      performance rating for the entire playing season in which the player was injured       was 6.9. The mean player performance rating for the two games prior to injury was      6.8 as opposed to 5.4 for the two games after return to sport. Athletes had a      significantly lower player performance rating immediately upon return to sport      when compared to ratings for the entire season (p<0.001) and when compared to      ratings from the two games prior to injury (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Following      return to sport from hamstring injury, player performance as assessed by the team      coach is reduced. This suggests that some athletes may return to sport prior to      complete resolution of the injury.FAU - Verrall, G MAU  - Verrall GMAD  - SPORTSMED SA Sports Medicine Clinic, 32 Payneham Road, Stepney, Adelaide, SA      5069, Australia.FAU - Kalairajah, YAU  - Kalairajah YFAU - Slavotinek, J PAU  - Slavotinek JPFAU - Spriggins, A JAU  - Spriggins AJLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20060419PL  - AustraliaTA  - J Sci Med SportJT  - Journal of science and medicine in sport / Sports Medicine AustraliaJID - 9812598SB  - IMMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Muscle, Skeletal/*injuriesMH  - Recovery of FunctionMH  - Soccer/*injuries/physiologyMH  - *Sprains and Strains/physiopathologyMH  - Thigh/*injuriesEDAT- 2006/04/20 09:00MHDA- 2006/07/21 09:00CRDT- 2006/04/20 09:00PHST- 2006/04/19 [aheadofprint]AID - S1440-2440(06)00031-4 [pii]AID - 10.1016/j.jsams.2006.03.007 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sci Med Sport. 2006 May;9(1-2):87-90.

This model builds      on the fact that only research that can, and will, be adopted by sports      participants, their coaches and sporting bodies will prevent injuries. Future      advances in sports injury prevention will only be achieved if research efforts      are directed towards understanding the implementation context for injury      prevention, as well as continuing to build the evidence base for their efficacy      and effectiveness of interventions. There is no doubt that intervention research       in the sporting field can be difficult and many challenges need to be overcome;      however, that should not be put up as a barrier towards undertaking it. Over the       next few years, sports injury researchers will need to think carefully about the       "best" study designs and analysis tools to achieve this. All reported sports      injury studies, of whatever design, should include information on key      implementation factors such as player/club recruitment rates and other biases as       well as the rate of uptake of the interventions being tested, including reasons      for use/non-use. However, it will only be broad research endeavours that adopt      the TRIPP six-staged approach that will lead to real-world injury prevention      gains.FAU - Finch, CarolineAU  - Finch CAD  - NSW Injury Risk Management Research Centre, University of New South Wales, UNSW      Sydney NSW 2052, Australia. c.finch@unsw.edu.auLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPT  - ReviewDEP - 20060417PL  - AustraliaTA  - J Sci Med SportJT  - Journal of science and medicine in sport / Sports Medicine AustraliaJID - 9812598SB  - IMMH  - Athletic Injuries/etiology/*prevention & controlMH  - Epidemiologic Research DesignMH  - HumansMH  - Intervention StudiesRF  - 27EDAT- 2006/04/18 09:00MHDA- 2006/07/21 09:00CRDT- 2006/04/18 09:00PHST- 2005/10/18 [received]PHST- 2006/02/14 [revised]PHST- 2006/02/28 [accepted]PHST- 2006/04/17 [aheadofprint]AID - S1440-2440(06)00023-5 [pii]AID - 10.1016/j.jsams.2006.02.009 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sci Med Sport. 2006 May;9(1-2):3-9; discussion 10.

METHOD: Five coaches of young girls' basketball teams (2 competitive; 3      recreational) were observed during practice sessions divided into individual      versus group and stationary versus active contexts. Communication was      characterized with various measures of content, form, and use. RESULTS: Coaches      rarely used pauses or communicative repetitions. Recreational coaches' utterances      contained more mazes than competitive coaches' utterances. Utterances used during      stationary activities tended to be longer and contain more than one verb compared      to utterances used during active activities; sentence fragments were more      frequent during active contexts. All coaches used jargon quite frequently.      CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The system reported here can be used to document      linguistic demands in other extracurricular activities, such as music programs      and scouting. Speech-language pathologists might include clinical activities to      help students deal successfully with the linguistic requirements that are      inherent in sporting activities.FAU - Masterson, Julie JAU  - Masterson JJAD  - Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders, Missouri State University,      Springfield 65897, USA.

The same and other research is not, however, informing      the coaching development process due to a lack of a big picture approach.      Consequently, there is a need for a model of coaching. In this paper, we offer      such a model in the form of a schematic that reflects the coaching process from      both a content and information-processing stance. To assess the validity of the      schematic, 16 expert coaches were interviewed to elicit a complete description of      their coaching process. The coaches were then shown a copy of the schematic and      asked to comment on its design and content with respect to its accuracy in      reflecting their coaching process. Following analysis of the interview, six      general categories emerged: Roles, Goals, Typical Actions, Required Knowledge,      Support for the Schematic, and Factors Influencing Development. The first four      categories clearly displayed an implicit support for the schematic. Furthermore,       all coaches offered explicit support for the schematic. Such strong support      confirmed that the schematic was valid and could form the basis of focused      interventions in coaching development.FAU - Abraham, AndyAU  - Abraham AAD  - School of Social Studies, Bell College, Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, UK.      a.abraham@bell.ac.ukFAU - Collins, DaveAU  - Collins DFAU - Martindale, RussellAU  - Martindale RLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Validation StudiesPL  - EnglandTA  - J Sports SciJT  - Journal of sports sciencesJID - 8405364SB  - IMMH  - *Decision MakingMH  - HumansMH  - Interviews as TopicMH  - KnowledgeMH  - Models, EducationalMH  - Physical Education and Training/*standardsMH  - *Professional CompetenceMH  - *SportsEDAT- 2006/04/14 09:00MHDA- 2006/11/15 09:00CRDT- 2006/04/14 09:00AID - N371464616835K74 [pii]AID - 10.1080/02640410500189173 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Sci. 2006 Jun;24(6):549-64.PMID- 16574460OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20060509DCOM- 20060629LR  - 20070712IS  - 1297-9589 (Print)IS  - 1297-9589 (Linking)VI  - 34IP  - 4DP  - 2006 AprTI  - [Endometriosis coaching].PG  - 329-36AB  - Coaching is a well-known terminology and an approach currently used, particularly      in the worlds of company management and sport, but its use in the medical field      appeared only recently. In the latter field, coaching bears behavioral and      psychological aspects. It can not only be intended to a medical team, but also      the practionner himself, for a better management of any disease, his patient for       a better treatment effect and compliance and an optimal coping with the disease.       In the case of endometriosis, a chronic disease, two key aspects are briefly      reviewed to illustrate the benefits of coaching and to sensitize health providers      to this approach. Thus, an appropriate diagnostic strategy should allow to reduce      the delay in the diagnosis, so frequently blamed, and to identify other      associated painful diseases. Also, management should be improved as well, not      only by applying appropriate therapeutic recommandations, and alternative      measures, but also by a better multidisciplinary support towards patient      expectations with long-term guidance.FAU - Audebert, AAU  - Audebert AAD  - IGF1, 35, rue de Turenne, 33000 Bordeaux, France. audebert@alienor.frLA  - frePT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticleTT  - Le coaching de l'endometriose.DEP - 20060330PL  - FranceTA  - Gynecol Obstet FertilJT  - Gynecologie, obstetrique & fertiliteJID - 100936305SB  - IMCIN - Gynecol Obstet Fertil. 2006 Dec;34(12):1206-7.

However, the media are full of examples of players, fans, and coaches      whose behavior veers out of control. There have been well-documented examples of       youth in livestock competitions illegally medicating show animals to make them      appear calmer, officials biasing their rulings toward a team that will take the      most fans to a playoff game, and team rivalries that have become so caustic as to      be dangerous for competitors and fans. A university extension and its partners      created a program called "Great Fans. Great Sports." in order to teach the kinds       of behaviors we wish to instill among all who are involved in competitions. It      requires entire communities to develop and implement plans for enhancing      sportsmanship in music, debate, drama, 4-H, and other arenas, as well as sports.       The goal is to make good sportsmanship not the exception but the norm. The      authors provide anecdotal evidence that "Great Fans. Great Sports." is having a      positive impact on the attitudes and behaviors of competitors, fans, and      communities.FAU - Lodl, KathleenAU  - Lodl KAD  - University of Nebraska-Lincoln, USA.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - New Dir Youth DevJT  - New directions for youth developmentJID - 101090644SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AggressionMH  - AttitudeMH  - Competitive Behavior/*ethicsMH  - Cooperative BehaviorMH  - HumansMH  - *Interpersonal RelationsMH  - *Moral DevelopmentMH  - Program DevelopmentMH  - Psychology, Adolescent/*ethicsMH  - *Residence CharacteristicsMH  - Social FacilitationMH  - Sports/*ethicsMH  - United StatesEDAT- 2006/03/31 09:00MHDA- 2006/05/09 09:00CRDT- 2006/03/31 09:00PST - ppublishSO  - New Dir Youth Dev. 2005 Winter;(108):127-34, 15.PMID- 16558664OWN - NLMSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINEDA  - 20100629DCOM- 20100702LR  - 20110825IS  - 1938-162X (Electronic)IS  - 1062-6050 (Linking)VI  - 35IP  - 4DP  - 2000 OctTI  - Youth Sports: A Pediatrician's Perspective on Coaching and Injury Prevention.PG  - 466-70AB  - OBJECTIVE: My objective is to review the factors that influence youth      participation in sports, to discuss the role coaches may play in youth sports      injuries, and to call on athletic trainers and other health professionals to      become involved in youth sports in an effort to limit injury risk. BACKGROUND:      Millions of American youths participate in team sports. Their primary motivation       to participate is to have fun. Unfortunately, large numbers of participants have       sustained correspondingly large numbers of injuries. Many injuries can be      attributed to improper technique and conditioning methods taught by volunteer      coaches. Although not the only contributors to injuries, these may be the most      amenable to preventive measures, such as formal instruction for coaches in the      areas of proper biomechanics and player-coach communication. DESCRIPTION: I      provide an overview of the reasons why children participate in sports, discuss      participation motivation, and review the literature on coaches' communication      methods that have been proved effective in maximizing learning and enjoyment for       young athletes. CLINICAL ADVANTAGES: This article provides certified athletic      trainers with the background knowledge needed to take an active role in youth      sports injury prevention at the community level.FAU - Koester, M CAU  - Koester MCAD  - Good Shepherd Community Hospital, Hermiston, OR.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Athl TrainJT  - Journal of athletic trainingJID - 9301647PMC - PMC1323376EDAT- 2006/03/25 09:00MHDA- 2006/03/25 09:01CRDT- 2006/03/25 09:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Athl Train. 2000 Oct;35(4):466-70.PMID- 16558575OWN - NLMSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINEDA  - 20100629DCOM- 20100629LR  - 20100915IS  - 1062-6050 (Print)IS  - 1062-6050 (Linking)VI  - 34IP  - 3DP  - 1999 JulTI  - Assessment of first-aid knowledge and decision making of high school athletic      coaches.PG  - 267-71AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the first-aid knowledge and decision making of      interscholastic athletic coaches exposed to athletic injuries. DESIGN AND      SETTING: Survey demographic information, First- Aid Assessment, and Game      Situation Data Sheet in 17 metropolitan high schools. SUBJECTS: A total of 17      metropolitan high schools participated in this study, and 104 athletic coaches      completed questionnaires. Fifteen different athletic sports were represented in      this investigation. Thirty coaches (29%) worked with more than one athletic sport      during the year. Male subjects constituted 83% (n = 85) of the sample. Years of      coaching experience ranged from first-year coaches to those with more than 28      years of experience. Most coaches (61%, n = 63) investigated were teachers, and      the remaining subjects were walk-on coaches. MEASUREMENTS: Central tendency      scores were determined in the demographic analysis. x(2) analyses were performed       to determine the interaction between First-Aid Assessment and the Game Situation       Data. RESULTS: Thirty-eight (36%) of the 104 athletic coaches tested achieved      passing scores of 29 or higher, with the total scores ranging from 19 to 34. For       the Game Situation Data Sheet, 75% (n = 78) of the coaches selected the same      response to 7 questions. Most coaches in this study chose to return injured      players to the game. We analyzed the data to determine whether coaches who passed      the First-Aid Assessment responded differently than those who did not. (The      scenario presented in one question involved a starting player's sustaining injury      when losing a close game.) Coaches who passed the First-Aid Assessment tended to       return injured starters to the game, whereas those who failed it kept injured      players out of the game. x(2) analysis on the second question (the team is      winning a close game when a regular player is injured) showed no tendency for      passing or failing coaches to respond differently. CONCLUSIONS: The athletic      coaches did not adequately meet first-aid standards as established for this study      in accordance with the American Red Cross. In addition, coaches who passed the      First-Aid Assessment tended to return an injured starter to the game, whereas      those who failed decided to keep the player out of the game. It is critical that       an unbiased, objective professional person provide all medical care on the      athletic playing field, preferably one who is certified in athletic training.FAU - Ransone, JAU  - Ransone JAD  - School of Applied Health and Educational Psychology, Oklahoma State University,      Stillwater, OK.FAU - Dunn-Bennett, L RAU  - Dunn-Bennett LRLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Athl TrainJT  - Journal of athletic trainingJID - 9301647PMC - PMC1322921EDAT- 2006/03/25 09:00MHDA- 2006/03/25 09:01CRDT- 2006/03/25 09:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Athl Train. 1999 Jul;34(3):267-71.PMID- 16558542OWN - NLMSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINEDA  - 20100629DCOM- 20100629LR  - 20100915IS  - 1062-6050 (Print)IS  - 1062-6050 (Linking)VI  - 34IP  - 1DP  - 1999 JanTI  - Collegiate coaches' knowledge of eating disorders.PG  - 19-24AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess, through exploratory research, 1) collegiate coaches'      knowledge of eating disorders, 2) the confidence of collegiate coaches in their      response correctness to questions about eating disorders among athletes, and 3)      demographic data related to prior education about eating disorders and the role      of the athletic department in providing such educational experiences. DESIGN AND       SETTING: We distributed a 2-part questionnaire to 258 NCAA Division I-A coaches      from 5 universities selected by sampling convenience. SUBJECTS: One hundred      thirty-eight collegiate coaches responded to the questionnaire for a response      rate of 53.5%. MEASUREMENTS: Our survey consisted of 30 true-false questions that      tested knowledge of eating disorders overall and in 5 domains. These domains      included etiology, identifying signs and symptoms, management and treatment, risk      factors, and education and prevention of eating disorders. Coaches indicated      their level of certainty in their responses by rating their confidence level on a      4-item Likert-type scale. Demographic data focused on educational programs      attended by coaches and teams. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze all      data. RESULTS: Our results suggest a need for coaches to achieve a greater      knowledge of eating disorders in all domains. Evidence showed that educational      programs about eating disorders were not often sponsored by the athletic      department for coaches or athletes. There seemed to be poor communication between      athletic departments and coaches regarding the availability of eating disorder      educational resources. CONCLUSIONS: Data suggested coaches could benefit from      comprehensive education in all domains of eating disorders; however, further      study is needed to validate these findings, to determine the actual effectiveness      of education in the prevention of eating disorders, and to differentiate coaches'      knowledge specific to sport coached and to coach and team sex.FAU - Turk, J CAU  - Turk JCAD  - Department of Physical Education, Exercise, and Sport Science, University of      North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC.FAU - Prentice, W EAU  - Prentice WEFAU - Chappell, SAU  - Chappell SFAU - Shields, E WAU  - Shields EWLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Athl TrainJT  - Journal of athletic trainingJID - 9301647PMC - PMC1322869EDAT- 2006/03/25 09:00MHDA- 2006/03/25 09:01CRDT- 2006/03/25 09:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Athl Train. 1999 Jan;34(1):19-24.PMID- 16464123OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20060208DCOM- 20060705LR  - 20061115IS  - 0112-1642 (Print)IS  - 0112-1642 (Linking)VI  - 36IP  - 2DP  - 2006TI  - Epicondylar injury in sport: epidemiology, type, mechanisms, assessment,      management and prevention.PG  - 151-70AB  - Epicondylar injuries in sports with overhead or repetitive arm actions are      frequent and often severe. Acute injury that results in inflammation should be      termed epicondylitis and is usually the result of large valgus forces with medial      distraction and lateral compression. Epicondylosis develops over a longer period       of time from repetitive forces and results in structural changes in the tendon.      Epicondylalgia refers to elbow pain at either the medial or lateral epicondyl of       the elbow related to tendinopathy of the common flexor or extensor tendon origins      at these points. Pain is usually associated with gripping, resisted wrist      extension and certain movements such as in tennis and golf, hence the common      terms 'tennis elbow' (lateral epicondylsis) and 'golf elbow' (medial      epicondylossi). A variety of assessment and diagnostic tools are available to aid      the clinician in their comprehensive evaluation of the patient to ensure correct       diagnosis and the appropriate conservative or surgical management strategy.      Corticosteroids and elbow straps are often used for treatment; however, there is       only very limited prospective clinical or experimental evidence for their      effectiveness. The most effective modalities of treatment are probably rest (the       absence of painful activity) combined with cryotherapy in the acute stage then      NSAIDs and heat in its various modalities including ultrasound. Cortisone      injections may be used to create a pain-free window of opportunity to optimise      the athletes' rehabilitation exercises. Medical practitioners should have a good       understanding of the mechanisms of injury in order to help treat and prevent the       re-occurrence of injuries. More emphasis by medical and sport science personnel      working with coaches and athletes needs to be placed on prevention of elbow      injury in sport through improved joint strength, biomechanically sound sport      technique and use of appropriate sport equipment.FAU - Hume, Patria AAU  - Hume PAAD  - Institute of Sport and Recreation New Zealand, Division of Sport and Recreation,       Faculty of Health and Environmental Sciences, Auckland University of Technology,       Auckland, New Zealand. patria.hume@aut.ac.nzFAU - Reid, DuncanAU  - Reid DFAU - Edwards, TonyAU  - Edwards TLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPT  - ReviewPL  - New ZealandTA  - Sports MedJT  - Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)JID - 8412297SB  - IMMH  - HumansMH  - Physical Therapy ModalitiesMH  - Tennis Elbow/epidemiology/etiology/*therapyRF  - 131EDAT- 2006/02/09 09:00MHDA- 2006/07/06 09:00CRDT- 2006/02/09 09:00AID - 3625 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Sports Med. 2006;36(2):151-70.PMID- 16419340OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20060118DCOM- 20060310LR  - 20091119IS  - 1059-8405 (Print)IS  - 1059-8405 (Linking)VI  - 21IP  - 6DP  - 2005 DecTI  - Sports nutrition for young athletes.PG  - 323-8AB  - Nutritional needs for peak athletic performance include sufficient calorie      intake, adequate hydration, and attention to timing of meals. Student athletes      and their advisors often are misinformed or have misconceptions about sports      nutrition. This paper identifies nutritional needs of young athletes, reviews      common misconceptions, and examines the nutrition knowledge of athletes and their      sources of nutrition information. Topics covered include energy, carbohydrate,      protein, fat and micronutrient needs, hydration requirements, timing of meals,      and issues related to age, gender, and specific sports. Other issues addressed      include "making weight" and ergogenic aids. Proper nutrition for young athletes      is critical not only to their athletic success, but more importantly to their      growth, development, and overall health. Nutritional recommendations should be      based on the most current scientific data; we provide information about      appropriate resources for the school nurse when advising student athletes and      their coaches and parents.FAU - Cotunga, NancyAU  - Cotunga NAD  - Department of Health, Nutrition, and Exercise Sciences at the University of      Delaware, Newark, DE, USA.FAU - Vickery, Connie EAU  - Vickery CEFAU - McBee, SheldonAU  - McBee SLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - J Sch NursJT  - The Journal of school nursing : the official publication of the National      Association of School NursesJID - 9206498SB  - NMH  - AdolescentMH  - *Adolescent Nutritional Physiological PhenomenaMH  - Age FactorsMH  - ChildMH  - *Child Nutritional Physiological PhenomenaMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Nutritional RequirementsMH  - School NursingMH  - Sex FactorsMH  - *SportsRF  - 43EDAT- 2006/01/20 09:00MHDA- 2006/03/11 09:00CRDT- 2006/01/20 09:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Sch Nurs. 2005 Dec;21(6):323-8.PMID- 16417143OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20060118DCOM- 20060210LR  - 20090204IS  - 0350-6134 (Print)IS  - 0350-6134 (Linking)VI  - 29IP  - 2DP  - 2005 DecTI  - A cross-cultural analysis of positive illusions and sport performance levels in      American, Croatian, and Norwegian basketball players.PG  - 453-8AB  - The present study examined the degree to which positive illusion is associated      with sport performance in basketball players among 3 different cultures: The      United States of America, Croatia, and Norway. Positive illusion is a cognitive      characteristic that is common in mentally healthy individuals, and becomes      especially important in the athletic arena. The model tested in this study      depicts the level of positive illusion as the main predictor variable and the      performance of the basketball players as the criterion variable. The Positive      Illusion Sports Scale was used to measure the predictor variable while The      Basketball Evaluation System was used to measure the criterion variable.      Participants were 239 competitive male basketball players, 122 from USA, 57 from       Croatia and 60 from Norway. Results showed that positive illusion was directly      (positively) related to actual success and that these relationships were      statistically significant and consistent with positive illusion as a theoretical       construct for predicting behavior and success.FAU - Catina, PeterAU  - Catina PAD  - Faculty of Kinesiology, The Pennsylvania State University, York 17403-3398, USA.

It outlines possible uses of Expert      Systems as diagnostic tools for evaluating faults in sports movements      ('techniques') and presents some example knowledge rules for such an expert      system. It then compares the analysis of sports techniques, in which Expert      Systems have found little place to date, with gait analysis, in which they are      routinely used. Consideration is then given to the use of Artificial Neural      Networks (ANNs) in sports biomechanics, focusing on Kohonen self-organizing maps,      which have been the most widely used in technique analysis, and multi-layer      networks, which have been far more widely used in biomechanics in general.      Examples of the use of ANNs in sports biomechanics are presented for javelin and       discus throwing, shot putting and football kicking. I also present an example of       the use of Evolutionary Computation in movement optimization in the soccer throw       in, which predicted an optimal technique close to that in the coaching      literature. After briefly overviewing the use of AI in both sports science and      biomechanics in general, the article concludes with some speculations about      future uses of AI in sports biomechanics. Key PointsExpert Systems remain almost       unused in sports biomechanics, unlike in the similar discipline of gait      analysis.Artificial Neural Networks, particularly Kohonen Maps, have been used,      although their full value remains unclear.Other AI applications, including      Evolutionary Computation, have received little attention.FAU - Bartlett, RogerAU  - Bartlett RAD  - School of Physical Education, University of Otago , Dunedin, New Zealand.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20061215PL  - TurkeyTA  - J Sports Sci MedJT  - Journal of sports science & medicineJID - 101174629PMC - PMC3861744OID - NLM: PMC3861744OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Artificial intelligenceOT  - Kohonen self-organizing mapsOT  - artificial neural networksOT  - evolutionary computationOT  - expert systemsOT  - sports biomechanicsEDAT- 2006/01/01 00:00MHDA- 2006/01/01 00:01CRDT- 2013/12/21 06:00PHST- 2006/12 [ecollection]PHST- 2006/12/15 [epublish]PST - epublishSO  - J Sports Sci Med. 2006 Dec 15;5(4):474-9.PMID- 16385150OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20051230DCOM- 20060302LR  - 20071115IS  - 1529-7713 (Print)IS  - 1529-7713 (Linking)VI  - 7IP  - 1DP  - 2006TI  - Using Rasch measurement to investigate volleyball skills and inform coaching.PG  - 39-54AB  - This paper illustrates some of the ways that Rasch modeling techniques can be      used to inform coaching of volleyball.

Examination of current approaches to coach       education are considered in relation to research evidence which describes the key      skills required in elite sports coaching. Recently, reflective practice has      emerged as a key skill with which to enhance coach learning and increase the      value of coaches' educational experiences. In tracing this emergence, this study       analyses the use of reflective practice and learning strategies within six      governing body award coaching programmes. Results indicate that none of the      programmes examined contained structures or processes for directly teaching or      overtly nurturing reflective skills. However, almost all programmes offered a      potential structure for this through completion of a coaching log or undertaking       a period of mentoring. Finally, recommendations are made to coach educators for      developing reflection within coach education programme structures.FAU - Knowles, ZoeAU  - Knowles ZAD  - Research Institute for Sport and Exercise Science, Liverpool John Moores      University, UK.

Unfortunately, most of these volunteer       coaches have not received formal training to prepare them adequately for the role      of youth sport coach. To exacerbate the issue, according to the popular media,      parents and other adults can commit belligerent and even violent acts around, and      often resulting from, poorly managed youth sport events. Although some efforts      have been made to standardize curricula, provide training for coaches, and      contain or prevent inappropriate parent behaviors, few efforts have been directed      at investigating the self-described needs and concerns of the coaches from their       perspectives. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the concerns      and issues of youth sport coaches related to coaching and parental education.      Five focus group interviews with 25 volunteer youth sport coaches were conducted       to investigate these issues. Results were organized around four higher order      themes that emerged from inductive content analyses: (a) coaching education      content areas of need, (b) barriers and problems of offering coaching education,       (c) coaching education format recommendations, and (d) efficacy of parental codes      of conduct. Results were discussed in terms of the potential impact      administrators, coaches, and parents could have in implementing formal coaching      education programs and developing their coaching education practices.FAU - Wiersma, Lenny DAU  - Wiersma LDAD  - Center for the Advancement of Responsible Youth Sport, California State      University, Fullerton 92834-6870, USA. lwiersma@fullerton.eduFAU - Sherman, Clay PAU  - Sherman CPLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - United StatesTA  - Res Q Exerc SportJT  - Research quarterly for exercise and sportJID - 8006373SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Athletic Injuries/prevention & controlMH  - CaliforniaMH  - *CertificationMH  - *Codes of EthicsMH  - CommunicationMH  - CurriculumMH  - FemaleMH  - Focus GroupsMH  - *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, PracticeMH  - HumansMH  - Interpersonal RelationsMH  - Interviews as TopicMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Needs AssessmentMH  - *ParentsMH  - Physical Education and Training/*organization & administrationMH  - Qualitative ResearchMH  - Sports/*educationMH  - Teaching/methodsMH  - Volunteers/*educationEDAT- 2005/11/08 09:00MHDA- 2006/03/01 09:00CRDT- 2005/11/08 09:00AID - 10.1080/02701367.2005.10599303 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Res Q Exerc Sport. 2005 Sep;76(3):324-38.PMID- 16270706OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20051107DCOM- 20060228LR  - 20071115IS  - 0270-1367 (Print)IS  - 0270-1367 (Linking)VI  - 76IP  - 3DP  - 2005 SepTI  - The parent-coach/child-athlete relationship in youth sport: cordial, contentious,      or conundrum?PG  - 286-305AB  - The roles of coach and parent are often synonymous in youth sport, but little      data-based research has been conducted on the parent-coach/child-athlete      relationship. Six boys in U-12 competitive soccer were interviewed regarding      positive and negative aspects about playing for their father-coach. Similar      questions were posed to father-coaches and two teammates. Inductive content      analysis indicated that, among the benefits, sons identified perks, praise,      technical instruction, understanding of ability level, insider information,      involvement in decision making, special attention, quality time, and motivation.       Costs of being coached by one's father included negative emotional responses,      pressure/expectations, conflict, lack of understanding/empathy, criticism for      mistakes, and unfair behavior. For father-coaches, positive themes included      taking pride in son's achievements, reason for coaching, positive social      interactions, opportunity to teach skills and values, enjoying coaching son, and       quality time. Negatives included inability to separate parent-child from      coach-player role, placing greater expectations and pressure on son, and showing       differential attention toward son. While teammates perceived some favoritism by      the parent-coach, they cited mostly positive instructional experiences.

A comprehensive review.PG  - 370-80AB  - The science of sports massage is of interest to many populations including      athletes, athletic trainers, coaches, as well as sports physiologists. While      evidence to support or refute the effects of massage on sports performance is      insufficient to make definitive statements, new reports and trends within data      help formulate an understanding of sports massage. This article will review      sports massage research on topics including lactate clearance, delayed onset of      muscle soreness (DOMS), muscle fatigue, the psychological effect of massage, and       injury prevention and treatment. Articles referenced in Medline, Cochrane      Database, the authors library, and references from articles are included in this       review. Most studies contain methodological limitations including inadequate      therapist training, insufficient duration of treatment, few subjects, or over or       under working of muscles that limit a practical conclusion. Muscle soreness      associated with DOMS is reduced with massage, although whether force recovers      more quickly is still unclear. The research literature to date is insufficient to      conclude whether massage facilitates recovery from a fatiguing effort. Both      tissue healing and a psychological effect of massage are areas that may prove      promising with further research.

The sport psychiatrist can work with competitive golfers in refining      their strategies for dealing with these myriad distractions and stressors. The      authors review pre-performance routine and methods for optimizing focus, and      discuss the science behind being "in the zone." The authors also discuss how      acute performance failure, or "choking," is best understood as being three      separate disorders. The sport psychiatrist's unique role in competitive,      professional golf is discussed by employing the concept of a sports mental health      continuum and its relation to psychiatric disorders.FAU - Clark, Terrence PAU  - Clark TPAD  - Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, James H.

The ability to delineate their role within the sports      club is crucial to mental health professionals' organizational success.

However, no formal evaluation of the benefits of attending such camps has been      undertaken heretofore. We assessed potential changes in the self-perceived health      of children with congenital heart disease who attended a special sports camp.      Thirty-one children with cardiac anomalies attended a 3-day multisports camp.      Sixteen children, all of whom were 10 years or older, literate, and Dutch- or      French-speaking, completed the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ-CF87) before and      after attending the camp. The scores of the children were compared with those of       healthy peers by calculating mean standardized differences. After attendance at      the sports camp, the children achieved significant improvements in the      self-perception of their physical functioning, role functioning due to emotional       problems, role functioning due to behavioral problems, mental health, and general      behavior. The children's self-esteem and general behavior after the camp were      significantly better than that of their healthy counterparts. We conclude that      children with congenital heart disease who participate in activities at special      sports camps may reap benefits in terms of their subjective health status.      Although further research is needed, we recommend the participation in sport      activities by children with heart defects, and more specifically their      participation in sports camps.FAU - Moons, PAU  - Moons PAD  - Center for Health Services and Nursing Research, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven,       Kapucijnenvoer 35/4, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.

Over 400,000       games are analysed. The leagues represented are the National League (1876-2002)      and American League (1901-2002) for baseball, the National Hockey League      (1917-2003) for ice hockey, the National Football League (1933-2002) for American      football, the National Basketball Association (1946-2003) for basketball, and the      four levels of professional football, formerly called the Football League, in      England (1888-2003). Problems caused by unbalanced playing schedules are      considered. The results are presented graphically to show long-term trends and      sudden changes. The highest levels of home advantage for all sports were in their      early years of existence. Home advantage in ice hockey, basketball and football      in England has declined over the last two decades. In baseball there has been      very little change over the last 100 years, with home advantage consistently      lower than in other sports. There was a large drop in home advantage in football       in England following the 7-year suspension of the league during the Second World       War. The trends and changes provide some evidence that travel and familiarity      contribute to home advantage, but little in support of crowd effects.FAU - Pollard, RAU  - Pollard RAD  - Department of Statistics, California Polytechnic State University, San Luis      Obispo, CA, USA. rpollard@calpoly.eduFAU - Pollard, GAU  - Pollard GLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - EnglandTA  - J Sports SciJT  - Journal of sports sciencesJID - 8405364SB  - IMMH  - Baseball/statistics & numerical dataMH  - *Competitive BehaviorMH  - EnglandMH  - Football/statistics & numerical dataMH  - Hockey/statistics & numerical dataMH  - HumansMH  - Mental FatigueMH  - North AmericaMH  - Soccer/statistics & numerical dataMH  - *Social EnvironmentMH  - Social SupportMH  - Sports/*psychology/statistics & numerical dataMH  - Travel/psychologyEDAT- 2005/08/11 09:00MHDA- 2005/09/09 09:00CRDT- 2005/08/11 09:00AID - 10.1080/02640410400021559 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Sci. 2005 Apr;23(4):337-50.PMID- 16086199OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20050808DCOM- 20051103LR  - 20061115IS  - 1436-9990 (Print)VI  - 48IP  - 8DP  - 2005 AugTI  - [Nurturing fair play in competitive sports. Results from a study on competitively      oriented youth soccer].PG  - 881-90AB  - Apologists of sports praise them as an ideal way to prevent addiction and      violence. Sports critics see it rather as a socialization authority on the morals      of the fair foul. This contradiction was investigated based on an examination of       fairness behaviour and fairness education in youth soccer as well as the question      of the connection between sports and violence and the preventive possibilities of      sports. Our results point to differences in understanding fairness according to      age, sex and primarily performance/success orientation. Teenagers learn al ready       at the latest in the C youth that it is important and right in the interest of      success to break rules. Thus it applies that the more distinctive the success      orientation, the more in formal and formal fair play degenerate into fictitious      action morals of competitive sport and make way for morals of the "fair foul".      The coaches play an important, even quite obviously the central role as      socialization agents. In stead of learning fairness, the opposite is often      conveyed to many young people in the organizations. However, our examinations      also show that coach es can positively influence both fairness understanding and       fairness behaviour of young footballers. Coach es are thus challenged as role      models to exemplify fair play by their own actions.FAU - Pilz, G AAU  - Pilz GAAD  - Universitat Hannover, Hannover. pilz@erz.uni-hannover.deLA  - gerPT  - Clinical TrialPT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticleTT  - Erziehung zum Fairplay im Wettkampfsport.

Swiss data are not available      in this respect. Using a standardized questionnaire 302 basketball players from      29 Swiss teams and their 29 coaches were interviewed. The questions focused on      the frequency of dental accidents, their prevention and subsequent procedure. The      participating 302 players came from three divisions: semi-professional players of      National League A and B (102), amateurs of Regional League 2 and 3 (100) and      young people of up to the age of 18 (100). The data were evaluated in relation to      division, sex and team function. Of the 331 interviewed persons 102 had already      seen a dental trauma in basketball and 55 had already had a dental trauma. Only      four of the interviewed persons wore mouthguards. The awareness of the procedure       following a dental trauma was unsatisfactory. The results of the survey show that      significantly more information and education is required in Swiss basketball not       only through sports associations but also through coaches and dentists.FAU - Perunski, SandraAU  - Perunski SAD  - Department of Oral Surgery, Oral Radiology and Oral Medicine, University of      Basle, Basle, Switzerland.FAU - Lang, BjornAU  - Lang BFAU - Pohl, YangoAU  - Pohl YFAU - Filippi, AndreasAU  - Filippi ALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - DenmarkTA  - Dent TraumatolJT  - Dental traumatology : official publication of International Association for      Dental TraumatologyJID - 101091305SB  - DMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - *Attitude to HealthMH  - Basketball/*injuriesMH  - Emergency TreatmentMH  - FemaleMH  - Health Education, DentalMH  - *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, PracticeMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Mouth ProtectorsMH  - Sex FactorsMH  - SwitzerlandMH  - Tooth Avulsion/etiology/therapyMH  - Tooth Injuries/*etiology/prevention & control/therapyEDAT- 2005/07/20 09:00MHDA- 2005/09/15 09:00CRDT- 2005/07/20 09:00AID - EDT310 [pii]AID - 10.1111/j.1600-9657.2005.00310.x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Dent Traumatol. 2005 Aug;21(4):195-200.PMID- 16012207OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20050713DCOM- 20111206IS  - 1998-3905 (Electronic)IS  - 0970-4388 (Linking)VI  - 23IP  - 2DP  - 2005 JunTI  - Perceptions of Chandigarh sports coaches regarding oro-facial injuries and their       prevention.PG  - 67-70AB  - Enthusiastic participation by the younger generation in sports exposes them to a       high risk of injuries. In the present study, the perceptions of sports coaches      regarding their knowledge and experience of such injuries is evaluated. The      coaches considered helmet as the most common protective device followed by mouth       guard and facemask. About 58% observed that boxing was associated with oro-facial      injuries and protective devices were deemed mandatory by 68% in this event. About      45% saw over five injuries in the last year, mostly soft tissue facial injuries      (47%) and tooth loss (33%). Most injuries were in hockey and 32% were due to hits      by ball, stick or related hard objects. About 82% were related to nonuse of      protective devices. The majority of coaches considered that oro-facial devices be      made more popular among sportspersons for their safety while 28% felt they      reduced efficiency. The author concludes that there is a need to popularize the      use of oro-facial protective devices in a variety of sports events in our country      by interacting with coaches, sports administrators and sportspersons as well as      familiarizing the Indian dentists in this relatively new field.FAU - Lehl, GAU  - Lehl GAD  - Department of Dentistry, Government Medical College and Hospital, Chandigarh,      India. gvlehl@yahoo.co.ukLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - IndiaTA  - J Indian Soc Pedod Prev DentJT  - Journal of the Indian Society of Pedodontics and Preventive DentistryJID - 8710631SB  - DMH  - AdultMH  - Athletic Injuries/*etiology/prevention & controlMH  - *Attitude to HealthMH  - Boxing/injuriesMH  - Facial Injuries/*etiology/prevention & controlMH  - FemaleMH  - Head Protective DevicesMH  - Health Knowledge, Attitudes, PracticeMH  - Hockey/injuriesMH  - HumansMH  - IndiaMH  - MaleMH  - MasksMH  - Mouth/*injuriesMH  - Mouth ProtectorsMH  - Protective Devices/utilizationMH  - SafetyMH  - Soft Tissue Injuries/etiology/prevention & controlMH  - *SportsMH  - Sports EquipmentMH  - Tooth Injuries/etiology/prevention & controlMH  - Tooth Loss/etiology/prevention & controlEDAT- 2005/07/14 09:00MHDA- 2011/12/13 00:00CRDT- 2005/07/14 09:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Indian Soc Pedod Prev Dent. 2005 Jun;23(2):67-70.PMID- 16004924OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20050711DCOM- 20060403IS  - 1556-228X (Electronic)IS  - 0278-5919 (Linking)VI  - 24IP  - 3DP  - 2005 JulTI  - Psychiatric and neuropsychological issues in sport medicine.PG  - 663-79, xAB  - This article reviews what is known about training room psychiatric/psychological       issues and how to recognize them, and provides an initial framework for how to      manage them.

In 2000, food samples were randomly acquired      in various cities of Catalonia. Analysis of the above pollutants were determined       according to the appropriate analytical techniques (ICP-MS, HRGC/HRMS, HPLC). In       general terms, elite sportsmen and sportswomen showed a higher intake of Cd, Hg,       Pb, HCB, PCNs, PCDD/Fs and PAHs than the general population, while it was lower      for PCDEs (both sexes), and PCBs and PBDEs (women). According to the FAO/WHO      provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) for metals, the WHO tolerable daily      intake (TDI) for HCB, and the US EPA's reference dose (RfD) for PAHs, the dietary      intakes of environmental pollutants should not mean a potential toxic hazard.      However, the WHO-TDI for PCDD/Fs and "dioxin-like" PCBs is exceeded in sportsmen.      The current results indicate that the consumption of those food groups showing      the highest contribution to the intake of these pollutants should be diminished.       In relation to this, the reduction of the consumption of dairy products and      cereals would be important.FAU - Falco, GAU  - Falco GAD  - Toxicology Unit, School of Pharmacy, University of Barcelona, Av.

The views of fourteen National and International elite coaches from      different northern Canadian communities are included within the study. The      respondents were from 9 different sport backgrounds and averaged 17.1 years of      coaching experience (range: 8-30 years). Data were gathered using a structured      open-ended questionnaire, a focus group, and a follow-up in-depth semi-structured      interview. Content was analyzed to uncover emergent themes.

For those athletes undertaking seasonal laboratory testing      (e.g., Vo(2), lactate threshold), it is imperative that athletes be able to      directly apply this information to their training device. We examined the      reliability of a standardized laboratory ergometer (Lode Excalibur Sport) and its      applicability to an electromagnetically braked ergometer (Computrainer) in 2      phases. Phase I (n = 12) examined the reliability of the Lode. Phase II (n = 14)       compared the Lode to the Computrainer using a randomized, counterbalance      assignment. Following warm-up, each trial started at 100 W, progressing 50 W      every 3 minutes to exhaustion. Outcomes were time-to-exhaustion (TTE), peak PO      (W) (PO(peak)), peak HR (HR(peak)), and ventilatory (VT) and respiratory      compensation (RCP) thresholds. We used a repeated measures analysis of variance      (ANOVA), Tukey post hoc analysis, regression analysis, Bland-Altman plots, and      coefficient of variation (CV) analysis for each variable. During phase I, we      found no significant difference for any variable, minimal dispersion of Vo(2)      during Bland-Altman analysis, and a low CV at each test stage (</= 5%). During      phase II, significant differences and higher CV for most parameters (all data; p       < 0.001) were observed for Lode versus Computrainer: TTE (21 minutes, 12 seconds       +/- 3 minutes, 12 seconds vs. 19 minutes, 9 seconds +/- 2 minutes, 36 seconds; CV      = 16%), PO(peak) (335 +/- 57.8 W vs. 295 +/- 47.1 W, CV = 17%), as well as PO at       VT (CV = 51%) and RCP (CV = 24%; p < 0.01). We conclude that coaches and cyclists      may need to use some caution when directly transferring results obtained from      laboratory testing to the Computrainer training device.FAU - Earnest, Conrad PAU  - Earnest CPAD  - The Cooper Institute Center for Human Performance and Nutrition Research, Dallas,      Texas 75230, USA. cearnest@cooperinst.orgFAU - Wharton, Richard PAU  - Wharton RPFAU - Church, Timothy SAU  - Church TSFAU - Lucia, AlejandroAU  - Lucia ALA  - engPT  - Clinical TrialPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Randomized Controlled TrialPT  - Validation StudiesPL  - United StatesTA  - J Strength Cond ResJT  - Journal of strength and conditioning research / National Strength & Conditioning       AssociationJID - 9415084SB  - IMSB  - SMH  - Bicycling/*education/physiologyMH  - Exercise Test/*instrumentationMH  - Heart Rate/physiologyMH  - HumansMH  - Muscle, Skeletal/physiologyMH  - Oxygen Consumption/physiologyMH  - Physical Education and Training/*methodsMH  - Physical Endurance/physiologyMH  - Reproducibility of ResultsEDAT- 2005/05/21 09:00MHDA- 2005/09/02 09:00CRDT- 2005/05/21 09:00AID - R-15714 [pii]AID - 10.1519/R-15714.1 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Strength Cond Res. 2005 May;19(2):344-8.PMID- 15892932OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20050516DCOM- 20060502LR  - 20131121IS  - 1556-228X (Electronic)IS  - 0278-5919 (Linking)VI  - 24IP  - 2DP  - 2005 AprTI  - Sports chronobiology consultation: from the lab to the arena.PG  - 415-56, xivAB  - This final article, coauthored by a chronobiology consultant, a sports      psychologist who applied a chronobiology-based program to an Olympic national      team, a clinical neurologist, a performance data analyst, a training-conditioning      coach from a major league baseball team who applied chronobiology principles to      major league pitchers, and a substance abuse expert, discusses practical aspects       of a sports chronobiology consultation, including the goals and current arsenal      of available interventions.

It can      have a profound negative impact on sleep quality, daytime alertness, mood, and      cardiovascular health, and effects on metabolic and endocrinologic parameters.      There is little known about the prevalence and presentation of apnea in athletes       and its potential effect on athletic performance.

Similarly, the role played by physical       activity in maintaining health has been well researched and is well documented.      However, little appears to have been published in recent years about the links      between physical activity and health in rural communities. The objective of this       article was to begin to address that gap. To achieve this, the article drew on      research conducted in two small rural communities in Victoria Australia, and      highlighted the role that physical activity and sport played in sustaining the      health and wellbeing of individuals and communities in rural areas. Taking the      World Health Organisation's definition of health (a state of complete physical,      mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease) as its      measure, the paper highlighted the many ways in which physical activity and sport      in rural communities contribute to physical health, mental wellbeing and social      cohesiveness. Based this finding, the authors suggest that physical activity and       sport make a significant contribution to the health and wellbeing of rural people      and their communities and suggest that further research is necessary to better      define this apparent contribution.FAU - Townsend, MAU  - Townsend MAD  - School of Health Sciences, Deakin University, Burwood, Victoria, Australia.      mardie@deakin.edu.auFAU - Moore, JAU  - Moore JFAU - Mahoney, MAU  - Mahoney MLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20020812PL  - AustraliaTA  - Rural Remote HealthJT  - Rural and remote healthJID - 101174860EDAT- 2005/05/07 09:00MHDA- 2005/05/07 09:01CRDT- 2005/05/07 09:00PHST- 2002/08/12 [epublish]AID - 109 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Rural Remote Health. 2002 Jan-Dec;2(1):109.

The self-image of sports has changed from a traditional,      competition-oriented way to adventure, entertainment, wellness and health.      Therefore, changes of our curricula to a practical-oriented way of teaching are      required. In a first step the motivations and expectations of the students have      to be evaluated. METHODS: 90 students enrolled in a sports medicine class were      evaluated using a questionnaire and compared to 60 students not participating in       the sports medicine class. RESULTS: The main motivation for the students to sign       in was the future possibility to subspecialize in sports medicine, followed by      interest in the subject. The main reasons not to participate were the time factor      followed by lack of interest. 80 % of the students were regularly practising      sports. 66 % commented on having been involved in sports trauma. 90 % of the      students believe that practical-oriented education is absolutely necessary.      CONCLUSION: Evaluation of the students motivation, knowledge as well as a      discussion of the current practice to teach sports medicine at medical school      confirm the need for modification of our curricula to a more practical-oriented      education.FAU - Roll, CAU  - Roll CAD  - Abteilung fur Unfallchirurgie, Klinikum der Universitat Regensburg.      christina.roll@klinik.uni-regensburg.deFAU - Kinner, BAU  - Kinner BFAU - Gruber, HAU  - Gruber HFAU - Nerlich, MAU  - Nerlich MLA  - gerPT  - Clinical TrialPT  - Controlled Clinical TrialPT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticleTT  - Wie beurteilen Medizinstudenten die Bedeutung der Sportmedizin fur die arztliche       Ausbildung?PL  - GermanyTA  - Z Orthop Ihre GrenzgebJT  - Zeitschrift fur Orthopadie und ihre GrenzgebieteJID - 1256465SB  - IMMH  - *CurriculumMH  - Data CollectionMH  - Education, Medical/*methods/statistics & numerical dataMH  - Educational Measurement/*methodsMH  - FemaleMH  - Germany/epidemiologyMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - *MotivationMH  - Sports Medicine/*education/statistics & numerical dataMH  - Students, Medical/statistics & numerical dataEDAT- 2005/04/26 09:00MHDA- 2005/07/01 09:00CRDT- 2005/04/26 09:00AID - 10.1055/s-2004-832409 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Z Orthop Ihre Grenzgeb. 2005 Mar-Apr;143(2):247-51.PMID- 15846733OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20050422DCOM- 20050719LR  - 20140729IS  - 1469-493X (Electronic)IS  - 1361-6137 (Linking)IP  - 2DP  - 2005TI  - Interventions implemented through sporting organisations for increasing      participation in sport.PG  - CD004812AB  - BACKGROUND: There is now compelling scientific evidence that increased levels of       physical activity can bring wide-ranging health benefits. These benefits can      extend beyond physical health and include other positive impacts relating to      mental health and personal development. The sport and recreation sector is viewed      as a priority area for increasing rates of physical activity. Participation rates      have been shown to be lower in females, decline with age, and are reduced in      lower socio-economic and minority groups. It is important to determine the most      effective interventions that sporting organisations can use to increase      participation. OBJECTIVES: To review all controlled evaluation studies of      interventions organised through sporting settings to increase participation.      SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials      (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsyclNFO, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, Sociological      Abstracts, Dissertation Abstracts, and a number of freely-available online health      promotion and sports-related databases. The internet was used extensively to      search for studies and locate information generated by sporting bodies throughout      the world. SELECTION CRITERIA: Types of studies: Controlled evaluation studies.      No minimum follow-up required. Uncontrolled studies, meeting other inclusion      criteria, were to be reported in an annex to the review. TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS:      People of all ages. Types of interventions: Any intervention designed to increase      active and/ or non-active participation in sport. These could include: mass media      campaigns; information or education sessions; management or organisational change      strategies; policy changes, for example to improve the socio-cultural environment      to encourage people of specific age, gender or ethnicity to participate; changes       to traditional or existing programs, for example club or association-initiated      rule modification programs; provision of activities beyond traditional or      existing programs, for example 'Come and Try' initiatives (teaser or taster      programs); skill improvement programs; volunteer encouragement programs. Types of      outcome measures: Change in the number of (active and non-active) participants in      organised sport, change in status from non-participating to non-active or active       participation, change in status from non-active to active participation. DATA      COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We assessed whether identified citations were controlled      evaluation studies which investigated the use of interventions implemented in      sporting settings to increase participation. Two reviewers independently      inspected abstracts. We obtained full papers where necessary. As no controlled      evaluation studies were located, no data collection or analysis was undertaken.      No uncontrolled studies meeting other inclusion criteria were identified and      therefore no annex is presented. MAIN RESULTS: Despite a thorough review of the      published and unpublished literature, we were unable to locate any rigorous      studies which tested the effects of interventions organised through sporting      organisations to increase participation in sport. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is       an absence of high quality evidence to support interventions designed and      delivered by sporting organisations to increase participation in sport.      Interventions funded and conducted in this area must be linked to a rigorous      evaluation strategy in order to examine overall effectiveness, sociodemographic      differentials in participation and cost-effectiveness of these strategies.FAU - Jackson, N WAU  - Jackson NWAD  - Cochrane Health Promotion and Public Health Field, 15-31 Pelham St., Carlton,      Victoria, Australia, 3053. njackson@vichealth.vic.gov.auFAU - Howes, F SAU  - Howes FSFAU - Gupta, SAU  - Gupta SFAU - Doyle, J LAU  - Doyle JLFAU - Waters, EAU  - Waters ELA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20050418PL  - EnglandTA  - Cochrane Database Syst RevJT  - The Cochrane database of systematic reviewsJID - 100909747SB  - IMUIN - Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2008;(3):CD004812.

Through semistructured interviews, the coaches revealed the      daily identity tensions they experienced. There was constant negotiation between       their social identities of "coach" and "lesbian." The social context of      intercollegiate women's athletics created a complex web that juxtaposed these      identities against commanding social norms. The challenges these coaches faced      ranged from doing what they believed was best for the well being of their      athletes (e.g., fighting homonegativism) versus what was best for their      professional well being (e.g., remaining silent). These coaches did not passively      accept their fate; while they struggled with identity negotiation, they also      found ways to counter the heterosexist atmosphere and create positive social      change.FAU - Krane, VikkiAU  - Krane VAD  - Women's Studies Program, School of Human Movement Sport, and Leisure Studies at      Bowling Green State University, Ohio 43403, USA. vkrane@bgnet.bgsu.eduFAU - Barber, HeatherAU  - Barber HLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - United StatesTA  - Res Q Exerc SportJT  - Research quarterly for exercise and sportJID - 8006373SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - *FacultyMH  - FemaleMH  - Homosexuality, Female/*psychologyMH  - HumansMH  - Interviews as TopicMH  - *Social IdentificationMH  - *SportsMH  - United StatesMH  - UniversitiesEDAT- 2005/04/07 09:00MHDA- 2005/06/29 09:00CRDT- 2005/04/07 09:00AID - 10.1080/02701367.2005.10599263 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Res Q Exerc Sport. 2005 Mar;76(1):67-81.PMID- 15805936OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20050404DCOM- 20050608LR  - 20061115IS  - 0009-921X (Print)IS  - 0009-921X (Linking)IP  - 433DP  - 2005 AprTI  - Medicolegal issues affecting sports medicine practitioners.PG  - 50-7AB  - The practice of sports medicine represents a unique subspecialty within the      discipline of medicine. Practitioners provide care for athletes who engage in      activities that may put the athletes at risk for serious injury. Physicians may      be held legally liable for not doing a standardized pre-participation evaluation,      for not administering adequate on-site or after injury care, or for violating an       individual's civil rights by refusing to allow continued participation because of      medical risk. The courts now are being asked to define obvious and necessary      risks. Medical law addresses the behavior, obligation, and liability-affecting      physicians who provide care for athletes. Many ethical and medicolegal issues      must be resolved by the legal system because coaches, athletic trainers, on-call       physicians, physicians providing pre-participation physicals, and the team      physician are being held responsible for injuries sustained during athletic      competition. This review is intended to assist all physicians who take care of      athletes by outlining their legal obligations and risks. Armed with this      knowledge, we expect that the sports medicine physician will be better able to      focus on patient care within the context of medicolegal obligations.FAU - Pearsall, Albert W 4thAU  - Pearsall AW 4thAD  - Section of Sportsmedicine & Shoulder Surgery, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery,       University of South Alabama College of Medicine, 3421 Medical Park Drive, Mobile,      AL 36693, USA. apearsal@usouthal.eduFAU - Kovaleski, John EAU  - Kovaleski JEFAU - Madanagopal, Sudhakar GAU  - Madanagopal SGLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Clin Orthop Relat ResJT  - Clinical orthopaedics and related researchJID - 0075674SB  - AIMSB  - IMMH  - Athletic Injuries/*diagnosis/*therapyMH  - ConfidentialityMH  - HumansMH  - Informed ConsentMH  - Injury Severity ScoreMH  - *Liability, LegalMH  - *Physician's Practice PatternsMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - *Safety ManagementMH  - Sports Medicine/*legislation & jurisprudence/methodsMH  - United StatesRF  - 38EDAT- 2005/04/05 09:00MHDA- 2005/06/09 09:00CRDT- 2005/04/05 09:00AID - 00003086-200504000-00008 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Clin Orthop Relat Res. 2005 Apr;(433):50-7.PMID- 15718601OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20050218DCOM- 20050310IS  - 0926-9630 (Print)IS  - 0926-9630 (Linking)VI  - 105DP  - 2004TI  - Cardiological telemonitoring in rehabilitation and sports medicine.PG  - 121-30AB  - The paper presents the development results of teleconsultative cardiology systems      and their application in rehabilitation and sport medicine. The first      teleconsultative cardiology (TELECARD) system was developed for outpatient      departments in the city of Kaunas, using Internet links. It was based on the      CompCardioSignal terminal. One branch of the TELECARD system with a mobile      CompCardioSignal terminal was used for functional state evaluation of Lithuanian       sportsmen during the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games. The examined results have shown      that every sportsman responded differently to acclimatization and the TELECARD      system provided support to physicians and coaches for making optimal decisions      regarding the sportsmen's adaptation and other situations. The final telemetry      system was used for rower monitoring. It was based on the new CompCardioSignal      terminal with three EASI ECG leads and synchronously recorded motion signals for       evaluation of human reaction to physical load. The developed telemonitoring      systems were a useful tool for evaluation of human reaction to physical load in      rehabilitation and sports activities.FAU - Vainoras, AlfonsasAU  - Vainoras AAD  - Institute of Cardiology, Kaunas University of Medicine, Sukileliu av. 17, 50167      Kaunas, Lithuania. alfavain@kmu.ltFAU - Marozas, VaidotasAU  - Marozas VFAU - Korsakas, StasysAU  - Korsakas SFAU - Gargasas, LiudasAU  - Gargasas LFAU - Siupsinskas, LaimonasAU  - Siupsinskas LFAU - Miskinis, VytenisAU  - Miskinis VLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - NetherlandsTA  - Stud Health Technol InformJT  - Studies in health technology and informaticsJID - 9214582SB  - TMH  - Computer SystemsMH  - Electrocardiography, Ambulatory/*instrumentationMH  - Exercise/*physiologyMH  - HumansMH  - LithuaniaMH  - Rehabilitation/*instrumentationMH  - Remote Consultation/*instrumentationMH  - Sports Medicine/*instrumentationMH  - Telemetry/instrumentationEDAT- 2005/02/19 09:00MHDA- 2005/03/11 09:00CRDT- 2005/02/19 09:00PST - ppublishSO  - Stud Health Technol Inform. 2004;105:121-30.PMID- 15707378OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20050214DCOM- 20050901LR  - 20091103IS  - 0112-1642 (Print)IS  - 0112-1642 (Linking)VI  - 35IP  - 2DP  - 2005TI  - Medical considerations in triathlon competition: recommendations for triathlon      organisers, competitors and coaches.PG  - 143-61AB  - Competitors in triathlons experience a range of environmental conditions and      physiological demands in excess of that found in individual sport events of      comparable duration. Consequently, there is a broad range of possible medical      problems and complications that must be taken into account when preparing for      such races. For most competitors, an Olympic-distance triathlon typically takes      between 2-4 hours to complete. This race begins with a swimming segment of 1500      m. Given the wide variety of race venues found around the world, these swims      occur in an assortment of water temperatures (from warm to cold) and conditions      (from ocean surf to lake calm). Swimmers often exit the water in a state of      moderate dehydration and hypothermia and then immediately start the 40 km cycling      leg. Many do so in their swimming attire. A wide variety of road surfaces,      technically challenging topography, variable environmental conditions and      dramatically changing velocities can be encountered on the cycle course. The race      concludes with a 10 km running leg. Since it is the final leg, it is often      completed in higher ambient temperatures than those encountered at the start,      with the athlete possibly running in a significant state of dehydration and      fatigue. Other medical problems commonly encountered in triathlon include: muscle      cramping, heat illness, postural hypotension, excessive exposure to ultraviolet      radiation, musculoskeletal injuries and trauma, gastrointestinal problems as well      as post-race bacterial infection, immunosuppression, sympathetic nervous system      and psychological exhaustion, and haemolysis. The rate of occurrence of such      events and the severity of their potentially negative outcomes is a function of      the methods used by both the race organisers and the competitors to prevent or      respond to the conditions imposed by the race. Triathletes also commonly compete       in both shorter 'sprint distance' events (in the range of a 0.75 km swim, 20 km      cycle and 5 km run) and longer events including both one-half and full Ironman      distances (2.5 and 3.8 km swim, 80 and 180 km cycle, 20 and 42 km run,      respectively), as well as ultra-distance events that exceed the Ironman distance.      In the longer events, the previously mentioned medical considerations are further      magnified and additional considerations such as hyponatraemia can also occur.      Reducing risk associated with these concerns is accomplished by: taking into      account weather and water temperature/conditions data prior to event scheduling;       effective swim, cycle and run course organisation and management; environmental      monitoring prior to and during the event; the implementation of a water safety      plan; provision of appropriate fluid replacement throughout the course;      implementation of helmet use and non-drafting regulations in the cycling leg; and      competitor knowledge regarding fluid replacement, biomechanical technique,      physical preparation, safe equipment and course familiarity. Despite these      concerns, triathlon participation appears to relatively safe for persons of all      ages, assuming that high-risk adults undertake health screening.FAU - Dallam, George MAU  - Dallam GMAD  - Department of Exercise Science, Health Promotion and Recreation, Colorado State      University - Pueblo, Pueblo, 2200 Bonforte Blvd, Pueblo, CO 81001, USA.      george.dallam@colostate-pueblo.eduFAU - Jonas, StevenAU  - Jonas SFAU - Miller, Thomas KAU  - Miller TKLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - New ZealandTA  - Sports MedJT  - Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)JID - 8412297SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - *Bicycling/physiologyMH  - Dehydration/etiologyMH  - FemaleMH  - Fluid TherapyMH  - Gastrointestinal Diseases/etiologyMH  - Heat Stroke/prevention & controlMH  - HumansMH  - Hypothermia/etiologyMH  - Immune ToleranceMH  - MaleMH  - Physical FitnessMH  - Protective DevicesMH  - *Running/physiologyMH  - Safety Management/*methodsMH  - *Swimming/physiologyMH  - TemperatureRF  - 68EDAT- 2005/02/15 09:00MHDA- 2005/09/02 09:00CRDT- 2005/02/15 09:00AID - 3524 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Sports Med. 2005;35(2):143-61.PMID- 15679567OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20050131DCOM- 20050512LR  - 20061115IS  - 0905-7188 (Print)IS  - 0905-7188 (Linking)VI  - 15IP  - 1DP  - 2005 FebTI  - Health promotion by means of health sport--a framework and a controlled      intervention study with sedentary adults.PG  - 13-20AB  - Only 10-20% of adults in industrialized countries reach the health-related      minimum level of a consumption of energy of more than 800 kcal week(-1),      additional to activities of daily living. The objective of this longitudinal      study was to evaluate the impact of a health-promoting exercise program for      sedentary adults on medical and subjective health status and on behavioral      changes. The first 12 months of the study (t1-t2) consisted of a structured      intervention exercise program. After this period, participants had the      opportunity to stay in a follow-up-program or to change to other programs of the       same club for further 12 months (t2-t3). Within these 2 years data have been      collected from the intervention group (117 subjects) and control group (40      subjects). It can be shown that on the basis of a structured intervention (one      session per week, 90 min, for 1 year), a stable behavioral change is reached with      positive effects on fitness status, risk factors and mental health. Contrary to      findings in other studies, the average health effects are at least stable in the       second year in this study.FAU - Brehm, WalterAU  - Brehm WAD  - Institute of Sport Science, University of Bayreuth, Germany.      walter.brehm@uni-bayreuth.deFAU - Wagner, PetraAU  - Wagner PFAU - Sygusch, RalfAU  - Sygusch RFAU - Schonung, AnkeAU  - Schonung AFAU - Hahn, UrsulaAU  - Hahn ULA  - engPT  - Clinical TrialPT  - Controlled Clinical TrialPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - DenmarkTA  - Scand J Med Sci SportsJT  - Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sportsJID - 9111504SB  - IMMH  - Energy IntakeMH  - Epidemiologic MethodsMH  - Exercise/*physiologyMH  - FemaleMH  - Fitness CentersMH  - Health Promotion/*methodsMH  - Health StatusMH  - HumansMH  - *Life StyleMH  - MaleMH  - Metabolic Syndrome X/physiopathology/rehabilitationMH  - Middle AgedMH  - *Physical FitnessEDAT- 2005/02/01 09:00MHDA- 2005/05/13 09:00CRDT- 2005/02/01 09:00AID - SMS369 [pii]AID - 10.1111/j.1600-0838.2003.00369.x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Scand J Med Sci Sports. 2005 Feb;15(1):13-20.PMID- 15673038OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20050127DCOM- 20050318LR  - 20071115IS  - 0270-1367 (Print)IS  - 0270-1367 (Linking)VI  - 75IP  - 4DP  - 2004 DecTI  - Analysis of coaching science research published from 1970-2001.PG  - 388-99AB  - The study followed a four-phase design.

National coaches (n = 8), youth academy      directors (n = 21) and academy coaches (n = 27) were surveyed using questionnaire      and interview methods. Questionnaire results revealed a lack of knowledge of      sport psychology that appeared to underpin some of the most significant barriers       to entry for sport psychologists. These included lack of clarity concerning the      services of a sport psychologist, problems fitting in and players' negative      perceptions of sport psychology. Overall, however, lack of finance was the      highest rated barrier. Six barrier dimensions emerged from the interview data:      negative perceptions of psychology, lack of sport psychology knowledge,      integrating with players and coaching staff, role and service clarity, practical       constraints, and perceived value of sport psychology. These findings were broadly      compatible with the survey data, with finance emerging as a major barrier and      misconceptions of sport psychology being common.

Skin infections are among the most common      dermatologic ailments in athletes; herpes simplex is clearly among the most      serious for the individual athlete, and ultimately the team. Herpes simplex      infection most often involves athletes with extensive skin to skin contact. For a      variety of reasons, wrestlers and rugby players seem particularly prone. The keys      to thwarting epidemics and reducing an athlete's disqualification period include       early diagnosis, rapid institution of therapy, and routine systematic      preventative measures. This clinical review examines the classification,      epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of herpes simplex virus      infection as it relates to contact sports. Attention to evidence-based medicine      is paid to treatment and prevention techniques.

Equipment innovations and/or equipment rules changes may      decrease the risk of injury. However, equipment and rules changes can alter the      essence or style of play of a particular sport, thus possibly increasing the risk      of injury.

It is necessary to differentiate between      harmless alterations of cardiac rhythm and potentially dangerous arrhythmias.      While the former are mostly the result of an increased vagotone as a consequence       of endurance training, the latter are raising the question whether intensive      physical and mental strains in competitive exercise are compatible with the      cardiac arrhythmias diagnosed. Vagotone-induced alterations of cardiac      arrhythmias generally disappear under exercise conditions. It is essential to      include the type, intensity and duration of the athletic activities into the      differential-diagnostic evaluations. However, those medical considerations      frequently collide with economic interests. Sinus bradycardia is a typical      example of vagotone-induced arrhythmias, which may be observed especially in      highly endurance-trained athletes. Sinus bradycardias are mostly asymptomatic and      rarely the cause of grave complications; therapeutic interventions are only      required if clinical symptoms such as orthostatic disturbances are present. The      different variants of cardiac conduction defects are-within certain limits-also      frequently induced by an increased vagotone; generally, they require an intensive      cardiologic diagnosis. Another frequent form of arrhythmias are ventricular      extrasystoles. Their dignity may be assessed by exercise ECG. Disappearance under      exercise conditions is, generally, a positive sign. Diagnosis and therapy of      cardiac arrhythmias are based on the established guidelines. Additionally,      regular cardiologic screenings are required in high-performance athletes of all      age groups.FAU - Latsch, JoAU  - Latsch JAD  - Institut fur Kreislaufforschung und Sportmedizin, Deutsche Sporthochschule Koln,       Koln. latsch@dshs-koeln.deFAU - Predel, Hans GeorgAU  - Predel HGLA  - gerPT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewTT  - Herzrhythmusstorungen im Sport.PL  - GermanyTA  - HerzJT  - HerzJID - 7801231SB  - IMMH  - Arrhythmias, Cardiac/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*prevention & controlMH  - CausalityMH  - IncidenceMH  - Physician's Practice PatternsMH  - Practice Guidelines as TopicMH  - Risk Assessment/*methodsMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Sports/*statistics & numerical dataRF  - 22EDAT- 2004/07/09 05:00MHDA- 2005/03/09 09:00CRDT- 2004/07/09 05:00AID - 10.1007/s00059-004-2592-2 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Herz. 2004 Jun;29(4):420-5.PMID- 15206262OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20040621DCOM- 20040826LR  - 20051116IS  - 0363-6771 (Print)IS  - 0363-6771 (Linking)VI  - 52IP  - 3DP  - 2004 May-JunTI  - A literature review of sports-related orofacial trauma.PG  - 270-80; quiz 281AB  - This literature review evaluates the significance of dental injuries and their      relationship to specific sports activities. Many studies have been published on      individual sports or groups of sports but most pertain to specific age groups or       levels of competition. Research suggests that many sports that do not require      mouthguards should encourage male and female participants to use orofacial      protectors. Athletes, coaches, athletic directors, athletic trainers, parents,      and members of the dental community should be aware of how individuals who      participate in sporting activities are at risk for dental trauma. Any sport where      the potential for dental trauma can exist (such as basketball, soccer, or      wrestling) should consider utilizing mouthguards to protect the competitors. The       establishment of mouthguard programs for athletes of all ages, genders, and      sports may help to reduce the incidence of dental trauma. A sports-related,      orofacial/dental trauma reporting system is considered.FAU - Kumamoto, David PAU  - Kumamoto DPAD  - College of Dentistry, University of Illinois, Chicago, USA.FAU - Maeda, YoshinobuAU  - Maeda YLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Gen DentJT  - General dentistryJID - 7610466SB  - DMH  - Age FactorsMH  - Athletic Injuries/*etiology/prevention & controlMH  - Facial Injuries/*etiology/prevention & controlMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Mouth/*injuriesMH  - Mouth ProtectorsMH  - RegistriesMH  - Sports/classificationMH  - Sports EquipmentRF  - 104EDAT- 2004/06/23 05:00MHDA- 2004/08/27 05:00CRDT- 2004/06/23 05:00PST - ppublishSO  - Gen Dent. 2004 May-Jun;52(3):270-80; quiz 281.PMID- 15202073OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20040617DCOM- 20041102LR  - 20090528IS  - 0210-0010 (Print)IS  - 0210-0010 (Linking)VI  - 38IP  - 11DP  - 2004 Jun 1-15TI  - [Attention deficit hyperactivity syndrome and the capacity to practice sports].PG  - 1001-5AB  - OBJECTIVE: To know the sportive activities of children and adolescents, males,      with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: There      were studied 100 patients, all males, with ages ranging 6 to 16 years (average:      9.28 years), 50 of the hospital and 50 of the private consultation. The subgroup       of ADHD was identified in all patients. The patients were asked on the sports      most usually made, although the response had to be confirmed by the parents.      RESULTS: Twenty-five cases showed attention deficit, 16 hyperactivity, and 59      combined form. If only one sport is to have had in consideration, football was      the most practiced sport, with 20 cases. If a second sportive activity was also      considered, cycling was the most practiced sport, with 29 cases, while only 23      patients played football (more than a 50% as goalkeeper) if we wanted the two      first options. A less number of cases made basketball, swimming, judo or      taekwondo, vasque ball and several others. Thirty three patients did not make any      sport and most of them showed an unsporting attitude. Less than a half of the      cases showed motivation to practice sport and less than a third was disciplined      obeying the orders of the coach and/or the leader. CONCLUSION: The patients with       ADHD mostly show little motivation for the sport activities, being cycling and      football (preferable as goalkeeper) the two most frequently practiced. The      patients usually show little motivation and discipline.FAU - Pascual-Castroviejo, IAU  - Pascual-Castroviejo IAD  - Servicio de Neurologia Pediatrica, Hospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid, Spain.       ipcastroviejo@terra.esLA  - spaPT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticleTT  - Sindrome de deficit de atencion con hiperactividad y capacidad para el deporte.PL  - SpainTA  - Rev NeurolJT  - Revista de neurologiaJID - 7706841SB  - IMMH  - *AchievementMH  - AdolescentMH  - *Attention Deficit Disorder with HyperactivityMH  - ChildMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Muscle HypotoniaMH  - Prospective StudiesMH  - Psychiatric Status Rating ScalesMH  - *SportsEDAT- 2004/06/18 05:00MHDA- 2004/11/04 09:00CRDT- 2004/06/18 05:00AID - rn2003647 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Rev Neurol. 2004 Jun 1-15;38(11):1001-5.PMID- 15187455OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20040609DCOM- 20040729LR  - 20061115IS  - 1017-995X (Print)IS  - 1017-995X (Linking)VI  - 38 Suppl 1DP  - 2004TI  - [Sports injuries in children and adolescents: etiology, epidemiology, and risk      factors].PG  - 27-31AB  - Growing participation of children in sports has resulted in an increased      incidence of sports injuries. Although methodological differences in      epidemiologic studies largely prevent precise comparisons, it appears that young       athletes participating in combat and contact sports seem to be more prone to      injuries. Knee and ankle injuries are the most commonly encountered problems and       chronic events are more prevalent than acute ones. The occurrence of athletic      injuries is multifactorial and may present differences with respect to sex and      the sports branch involved.

The athlete was referred to a sports      psychologist. In consultations, it became clear that he was having difficulty      reconciling the difference between his life as it used to be and as it would be      in the future. Part of his difficulty was dealing with the frustration and anger       "outbursts" which resulted from not being able to perform straightforward      everyday motor skills.

Participants were 512 boy and 202 girl Norwegian youth football      players (12-14 years old) competing in an international football tournament. A 2       x 2 x 2 (gender, mastery climate high and low, performance climate high and low)       MANOVA produced no multivariate or interaction effects, but main effects for      gender, performance climate, and mastery climate did emerge. Post hoc analyses of      the simple main effects found that boys and girls were different in      sportspersonship, but only in that boys were more sportspersonlike than girls on       one of the four sportspersonship dimensions. Players perceiving a high mastery      climate endorsed sportspersonship more than those players perceiving a low      mastery climate, and players perceiving a high performance climate were less      likely to endorse sportspersonship than players perceiving a low performance      climate. Canonical correlation analysis revealed that a strong mastery climate      was positively associated with commitment, respect for social conventions, and      respect for rules and officials. A strong performance climate was negatively      associated with respect and concern for social conventions and respect for rules       and officials, while a positive association emerged for respect and concern for      the opponent. The results of our study suggest that both boys and girls may well       perceive the coach emphasizing similar criteria of success and failure and      thereby a similar culture of sportspersonship, while in general a strong mastery       climate leads to a higher sportspersonship orientation.FAU - Miller, Blake WAU  - Miller BWAD  - Norwegian University of Sport Science, Oslo, Norway. blake.miller@nih.noFAU - Roberts, Glyn CAU  - Roberts GCFAU - Ommundsen, YngvarAU  - Ommundsen YLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - DenmarkTA  - Scand J Med Sci SportsJT  - Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sportsJID - 9111504SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - ChildMH  - *Competitive BehaviorMH  - FemaleMH  - GoalsMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - *MotivationMH  - NorwayMH  - Soccer/*psychologyEDAT- 2004/05/18 05:00MHDA- 2004/08/27 05:00CRDT- 2004/05/18 05:00AID - 10.1111/j.1600-0838.2003.00320.x [doi]AID - SMS320 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Scand J Med Sci Sports. 2004 Jun;14(3):193-202.PMID- 15142024OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20040514DCOM- 20040831LR  - 20041117IS  - 1064-8011 (Print)IS  - 1064-8011 (Linking)VI  - 18IP  - 2DP  - 2004 MayTI  - Coaching difference: a case study of 4 African American women student-athletes.PG  - 242-51AB  - The purpose of the present investigation was to describe the experiences of      African American women student-athletes and the role that coaches play in those      experiences.

Using data gathered through the qualitative methods of document      analysis, background questionnaires, focus groups, grounded surveys, and in-depth      individual interviews, the results of the study are focused on how coaches affect      individual student-athletes and, most specifically, a particular segment of the      athletic world that tends to be overlooked: the African American woman. Results      are organized according to the following themes that emerged through the      collection of data: (a) the involvement of coaches in African American women      student-athletes' exposure to racism through stereotypes, (b) coaches as      significant influences on African American women becoming involved and remaining       involved in sport, and (c) power structures in sport and society affecting      African American women as a form of institutional racism.

Since its inception, over 40      universities have received recognition status. The NSCA is currently examining      the interest, need, and feasibility of creating an ERP for graduate curriculum      specific to sports performance. The current investigation included a survey of      Division I, II, and III strength and conditioning professionals. Surveys were      mailed to 215 coaches, of which 53 responded (26% rate of return). Five factors      were extracted from the questionnaire and were subsequently named: Application of      Science to Strength and Conditioning, Professional Development, Graduate      Curriculum Support, Graduate Program Requirements, and Graduate Assistantships. A      one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) found significant differences on Application      of Science to Strength and Conditioning and Professional Development when      comparing highest degree earned. Pairwise analysis indicated that individuals      with Master's degrees scored those factors higher compared with individuals with       Bachelor's degrees.

In 1995, a national rugby injury prevention program was instigated to address      this problem. Known as Tackling Rugby Injury, this multifaceted program was      implemented over a five-year period. The program was based on the results of a      prospective cohort study of rugby injury, known as the Rugby Injury and      Performance Project (RIPP), and was organised around seven themes, five relating       to the prevention of injury: coaching, fitness, injury management, tackling, and       foul play, and two relating to the implementation and evaluation of the program.       The purpose of this paper is to describe the lessons learned from the      implementation of Tackling Rugby Injury. Qualitative research methods were used      to describe the process of implementation, including informant interviews,      participant observation, and the scrutiny of written, visual and archival      material. Among the lessons learned were the importance of basing injury      prevention strategies on scientific evidence rather than popular belief, the      difficulty in implementing complex interventions, the advantages of a formal      agreement between partners in the implementation of a program, the central role      played by coaches in promoting injury prevention strategies, and the value of      describing the process of implementation as well as monitoring injury outcomes      and changes in knowledge, attitudes and behaviour. It is hoped that other sports       wishing to develop injury prevention programs can learn from this experience.FAU - Chalmers, D JAU  - Chalmers DJAD  - Injury Prevention Research Unit, Department of Preventive and Social Medicine,      Dunedin School of Medicine, University of Otago, New Zealand.FAU - Simpson, J CAU  - Simpson JCFAU - Depree, RAU  - Depree RLA  - engPT  - CommentPT  - Evaluation StudiesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - AustraliaTA  - J Sci Med SportJT  - Journal of science and medicine in sport / Sports Medicine AustraliaJID - 9812598SB  - IMCON - J Sci Med Sport. 2004 Mar;7(1):56-7.

During a regional competition in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, 55      coaches were interviewed. These coaches represented 22 cities with athletes      enrolled in Olympic gymnastics, tennis, swimming, and judo events. A 3-section      questionnaire was used to obtain data on demographic characteristics, dietary      recommendations, and nutrition knowledge. Results showed that all coaches      recommended general dietary practices during training, with no specific      strategies for pre-, during-, and post-training periods. The main objectives of      the recommendations for the training period were weight control and muscle mass      gain. Deleterious weight control practices were recommended by 27% of the      coaches. Specific dietary practices pre and post competition were recommended by       93% and 46% of the coaches, respectively. Participants responded correctly to 70%      (SD = 3.2) of the nutrition knowledge questions, with no significant differences       (p =.61) between sports.

Moreover, mental rotation calls upon motor processes      that are heavily involved in sporting activities. For these reasons, the authors       hypothesized that athletes ought to perform mental rotation tasks better than      nonathletes. Also, athletes trained to react quickly to constantly changing      environments should be faster at processing the information in a mental rotation       task than athletes operating in more settled environments. The results of this      study show that athletes performed the mental rotation task significantly faster       than nonathletes. These results support the suggestion that there is a link      between sport and the ability to perform mental image transformations; however,      this ability may not be specific to the conditions in which the athlete performs.FAU - Ozel, SylvieAU  - Ozel SAD  - Center for Research on Physical Activity and Sport, University of Caen, France.      sylvie.ozel@wanadoo.frFAU - Larue, JacquesAU  - Larue JFAU - Molinaro, CorinneAU  - Molinaro CLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J PsycholJT  - The Journal of psychologyJID - 0376332SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - CognitionMH  - HumansMH  - *ImaginationMH  - MaleMH  - Random AllocationMH  - Reaction TimeMH  - RotationMH  - *Space PerceptionMH  - *Spatial BehaviorMH  - *SportsEDAT- 2004/04/22 05:00MHDA- 2004/07/28 05:00CRDT- 2004/04/22 05:00AID - 10.3200/JRLP.138.1.49-64 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Psychol. 2004 Jan;138(1):49-63.PMID- 15077766OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20040413DCOM- 20040504LR  - 20041117IS  - 0033-2941 (Print)IS  - 0033-2941 (Linking)VI  - 94IP  - 1DP  - 2004 FebTI  - Athletes' and coaches' perceptions of sport psychology services offered by      graduate students at one NCAA Division I university.PG  - 213-6AB  - In recent years, there have been increasing calls for graduate programs in sport       psychology to include supervised practicum experiences.

Data were collected from 170 assistant coaches of women's      teams (i.e., women's basketball, softball, track, volleyball, soccer, and      tennis). Results indicate that women's perceived work experiences and outcomes      were comparable, and sometimes better, than those of men. We present competing      explanations for this finding. First, it is possible that these women were not      subjected to treatment discrimination. Alternatively, it is possible that this      demonstrates the existence of the "paradox of the contented working woman."      Additional analyses indicate that work experiences explained a large portion of      the variance in organizational commitment and turnover intentions, thereby      demonstrating their importance in the workplace.FAU - Cunningham, George BAU  - Cunningham GBAD  - Department of Health and Kinesiology, Texas A&M University, College Station      77843-4243, USA. gbcunningham@hlkn.tamu.eduFAU - Sagas, MichaelAU  - Sagas MLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Res Q Exerc SportJT  - Research quarterly for exercise and sportJID - 8006373SB  - IMMH  - *Administrative PersonnelMH  - AdultMH  - *Discrimination (Psychology)MH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - Job SatisfactionMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - *SportsMH  - United StatesMH  - *Women, WorkingMH  - WorkplaceEDAT- 2004/02/11 05:00MHDA- 2004/04/09 05:00CRDT- 2004/02/11 05:00AID - 10.1080/02701367.2003.10609115 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Res Q Exerc Sport. 2003 Dec;74(4):455-66.PMID- 14768845OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20040210DCOM- 20040408LR  - 20071115IS  - 0270-1367 (Print)IS  - 0270-1367 (Linking)VI  - 74IP  - 4DP  - 2003 DecTI  - Moral issues in sport: the child's perspective.PG  - 445-54AB  - Sport offers opportunities for children to identify and resolve moral issues.      Moral issues in sport have primarily been studied from the researcher's      perspective, with the child's perspective relatively ignored. Thus, the purpose      of this study was to explore the nature and content of the issues children      experienced in sport. Interview participants consisted of 7 boys and 8 girls      ranging in age from 10 to 12 years (M = 11.6 years, SD = 1.7) who had competitive      youth sport experience. An inductive content analysis revealed that children      identified issues surrounding three overall dimensions concerning fairness of      adult's actions, negative game behaviors, and negative team behaviors. Specific      examples of issues included unfair actions by coaches, disrespecting opponents,      and selfish behavior in practice.

However, asthma      has not been reported as a cause of death in competitive athletes. OBJECTIVE: The      object of this study was to raise the awareness of physicians, coaches, trainers,      and parents that children and adults can have fatal asthma exacerbations during      and immediately after participating in sports. METHODS: The Temple Sports Asthma       Research Center identified athletes from 1993 until 2000 who died during or after      sporting activity by using the nationwide Burrell's Information Service. Once a      possible asthma-related sports death was identified, the autopsy report was      requested from the coroner or medical examiner, and an attempt was made to      contact the family. Contact with the family was limited to information about the       death, medical history, sports involvement, and any medication usage by the      person who had died. Secondary sources, including news reports, were used to      confirm whether the subject died of asthma during or immediately after a sporting      activity. RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-three possible cases were identified.      Sixty-one deaths met the criteria for study inclusion. White deaths outnumbered      black deaths by 2 to 1. Deaths among male subjects predominated. Most subjects      were younger than the age of 20 years, with the most prevalent age group being      between 10 to 14 years old. Fifty-one percent (18 of 35) of the competitive      athletes had their fatal event while participating in organized sport, 14 in a      practice situation and 4 deaths during a game or meet setting. Basketball and      track were the 2 most frequent activities performed at the time of the fatal      event. CONCLUSION: The subjects who had fatal asthma exacerbations were usually      white male subjects between the ages of 10 and 20 years. Mild intermittent or      persistent asthma by history was commonly identified. Sudden fatal asthma      exacerbations occur in both competitive and recreational athletes and can be      precipitated by sporting activity.FAU - Becker, Jack MAU  - Becker JMAD  - Section of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, Department of Pediatrics, St.      Christopher's Hospital for Children, Drexel University College of Medicine,      Philadelphia, USA.FAU - Rogers, JamesAU  - Rogers JFAU - Rossini, GregoryAU  - Rossini GFAU - Mirchandani, HareshAU  - Mirchandani HFAU - D'Alonzo, Gilbert E JrAU  - D'Alonzo GE JrLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - United StatesTA  - J Allergy Clin ImmunolJT  - The Journal of allergy and clinical immunologyJID - 1275002SB  - AIMSB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - Asthma/complications/*mortalityMH  - Cause of DeathMH  - ChildMH  - Death, Sudden/epidemiology/*etiologyMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - RecreationMH  - *SportsEDAT- 2004/02/10 05:00MHDA- 2004/03/18 05:00CRDT- 2004/02/10 05:00AID - 10.1016/j.jaci.2003.10.052 [doi]AID - S0091674903025363 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2004 Feb;113(2):264-7.PMID- 14737504OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20040122DCOM- 20040416LR  - 20061115IS  - 0306-0012 (Print)IS  - 0306-0012 (Linking)VI  - 33IP  - 1DP  - 2004 Jan 10TI  - Sports drug testing--an analyst's perspective.PG  - 1-13AB  - Sport plays a major role in the lives of many people, both for active      participation and as entertainment. Sport is now a huge nationally and      internationally based industry. The desire to win has led some athletes to resort      to the use of performance enhancing drugs. With huge financial rewards now      available in some sports the pressure to excel has grown. Some have argued that      drug use should be given free rein, however most people are of the view that it      is athletic prowess that should be applauded not the efficacy of various      performance enhancing drugs. Apart from the obvious aspects of equality and fair       play, the use of drugs is associated with significant health risks. In the 1960's      the use of stimulants in sports such as cycling led to the death of at least one       cyclist. Since 1968 the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has required all      Olympic Games' host cities to provide laboratory facilities for the analysis and       detection of performance enhancing drugs. There are now 29 IOC accredited      laboratories throughout the world that routinely test samples from athletes for      the presence of such drugs. The purpose of this tutorial review is to give an      overview of drug testing procedures, including those that were used at the last      summer Olympic Games in Sydney 2000, and the incorporation of the latest      developments in analytical chemistry technology in the drug testing process. More      recently, developments in biotechnology mean that the use of whole new classes of      drugs are banned in sport, often requiring new methodologies and techniques for      their analysis. The contest between those who wish to cheat and those who wish to      maintain fair play in sport is an ongoing one.FAU - Trout, Graham JAU  - Trout GJAD  - Australian Sports Drug Testing Laboratory, Australian Government Analytical      Laboratories, Sydney, Australia. graham.trout@agal.gov.auFAU - Kazlauskas, RymantasAU  - Kazlauskas RLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPT  - ReviewDEP - 20031208PL  - EnglandTA  - Chem Soc RevJT  - Chemical Society reviewsJID - 0335405RN  - 0 (Anabolic Agents)RN  - 0 (Central Nervous System Stimulants)RN  - 0 (Diuretics)RN  - 0 (Hormones)RN  - 0 (Narcotics)RN  - 0 (Steroids)SB  - IMMH  - Anabolic Agents/urineMH  - Central Nervous System Stimulants/urineMH  - Diuretics/urineMH  - Doping in Sports/classification/*prevention & control/trendsMH  - Hormones/urineMH  - HumansMH  - Molecular StructureMH  - Narcotics/urineMH  - Steroids/urineMH  - Substance Abuse Detection/*methods/trendsMH  - Time FactorsRF  - 41EDAT- 2004/01/23 05:00MHDA- 2004/04/17 05:00CRDT- 2004/01/23 05:00PHST- 2003/12/08 [aheadofprint]PHST- 2004/01/21 [epublish]AID - 10.1039/b201476a [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Chem Soc Rev. 2004 Jan 10;33(1):1-13.

Unfortunately, epileptics have previously been discouraged from      participation in physical activity and sports for fear of inducing seizures or      increasing seizure frequency. Despite a shift in medical recommendations toward      encouraging rather than restricting participation, the stigma remains and      epileptics continue to be less active than the general population. This results      in increased body mass index, decreased aerobic endurance, poorer self-esteem,      and higher levels of anxiety and depression. Although there are rare cases of      exercise-induced seizures, studies have shown that physical activity can decrease      seizure frequency, as well as lead to improved cardiovascular and psychologic      health. The majority of sports are safe for epileptics to participate in with      special attention to adequate seizure control, close monitoring of medications,      and preparation of family, coaches, or trainers. Contact sports including      football, hockey, and soccer have not been shown to induce seizures, and      epileptics should not be precluded from participation. Water sports and swimming       are felt to be safe if seizures are well controlled and direct supervision is      present. Additional care must be taken in sports involving heights such as      gymnastics, harnessed rock climbing, or horseback riding. Sports such as      hang-gliding, scuba diving, or free climbing are not recommended, given the risk       of severe injury or death, if a seizure were to occur during the activity. This      article reviews the risks and benefits of physical activity in epileptics,      discusses sports in which epileptics may participate, and addresses how to      decrease possible risks for injury.FAU - Howard, Gregory MAU  - Howard GMAD  - Ball Memorial Hospital and Central Indiana Sports Medicine Fellowship, Muncie, IN      47304, USA. t omsevier@comcast.netFAU - Radloff, MonikaAU  - Radloff MFAU - Sevier, Thomas LAU  - Sevier TLLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Curr Sports Med RepJT  - Current sports medicine reportsJID - 101134380SB  - IMMH  - Athletic Injuries/etiology/prevention & controlMH  - Epilepsy/complications/*physiopathologyMH  - Exercise/physiologyMH  - HumansMH  - RiskMH  - *SportsMH  - Sports MedicineRF  - 31EDAT- 2004/01/20 05:00MHDA- 2004/03/12 05:00CRDT- 2004/01/20 05:00PST - ppublishSO  - Curr Sports Med Rep. 2004 Feb;3(1):15-9.PMID- 14708646OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20040107DCOM- 20040120LR  - 20041117IS  - 1600-4469 (Print)IS  - 1600-4469 (Linking)VI  - 19IP  - 5DP  - 2003 OctTI  - Dental and oral trauma and mouthguard use during sport activities in Israel.PG  - 237-42AB  - The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the occurrence of oral and      dental injuries in young Israeli population engaged in diverse sport activities.       The participants' awareness of the use of protective devices, such as      mouthguards, during sport activities was also evaluated. A population of 943      young adults, 95% males and 5% females (ages 18-19), was surveyed. A      questionnaire was distributed relating to the type of sport activity practised,      past oral and dental injuries over their lifetime, specifying the time and type      of sports in which the injury occurred and the use and awareness of the      protective devices. Of the total population examined, 850 (90%) were active in at      least one type of sport, either as professionals or as amateurs. The analysis      included the population that regularly participated in at least one sporting      activity. The most commonly practised sports were soccer (54% of all active      participants) and basketball (50%). The total number of dental and oral injuries       experienced during all sport activities was 229, affecting 27% of the      participants of whom 73 (9%) suffered dental injuries. Most dental injuries      occurred during the basketball and soccer training sessions and matches reaching       42 and 41% of the total number of injuries, respectively, and affected 7.2 and      6.6% of the basketball and soccer players. Traumatic dental injuries in other      sports occurred in less than 7% of the participants in these activities. Only 27%      of the participants were aware of the protective devices, such as a mouthguards,       and only 3% actually used these devices. These results point to the high risk of       potential dental and oral injury during sport activities, the little knowledge      about the benefits of using mouthguards and their limited utilization. The      importance of public health education to increase the awareness of protective      measures and devices and their actual use in Israel is the main focus. It should       be a combined duty of dentists and sports physicians and of the coaches to      encourage the use of protective devices during training and games.FAU - Levin, LiranAU  - Levin LAD  - Department of Restorative Dentistry, The Maurice and Gabriela Goldschleger School      of Dental Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.FAU - Friedlander, L DanielAU  - Friedlander LDFAU - Geiger, Selly BAU  - Geiger SBLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - DenmarkTA  - Dent TraumatolJT  - Dental traumatology : official publication of International Association for      Dental TraumatologyJID - 101091305SB  - DMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - Age DistributionMH  - Athletic Injuries/*epidemiologyMH  - Basketball/injuriesMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - Israel/epidemiologyMH  - MaleMH  - Maxillofacial Injuries/*epidemiologyMH  - Mouth Protectors/*utilizationMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Soccer/injuriesMH  - Tooth Injuries/*epidemiologyEDAT- 2004/01/08 05:00MHDA- 2004/01/21 05:00CRDT- 2004/01/08 05:00PST - ppublishSO  - Dent Traumatol. 2003 Oct;19(5):237-42.PMID- 14674189OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20031216DCOM- 20040217LR  - 20041117IS  - 0738-467X (Print)IS  - 0738-467X (Linking)VI  - 22IP  - 12DP  - 2003 DecTI  - Hero, coach, teacher & mentor.

Often, injury history data are collected by self report      surveys, with the potential for recall bias. OBJECTIVE: To assess the accuracy of      a 12 month injury history recall in a population of 70 community level Australian      football players. METHODS: The retrospective, self reported injury histories of      70 community level Australian football players were compared with prospective      injury surveillance records for the same 12 month period. The accuracy of the      players' recall of the number of injuries, injured body regions, and injury      diagnosis was assessed. RESULTS: Recall accuracy declined as the level of detail       requested increased. All players could recall whether or not they were injured      during the previous year. Almost 80% were able to accurately recall the number of      injuries and body regions injured, but not the diagnoses, whereas only 61% were      able to record the exact number, body region, and diagnosis of each injury      sustained. DISCUSSION: The findings of this study highlight the difficulty of      using retrospectively collected injury data for research purposes. Any injury      research relying on self reported injury history data to establish the relation      between injury history and injury risk should consider the validity of the self      report injury histories.FAU - Gabbe, B JAU  - Gabbe BJAD  - Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Central and Eastern Clinical       School, Alfred Hospital, University of Monash, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.      belinda.gabbe@med.monash.edu.auFAU - Finch, C FAU  - Finch CFFAU - Bennell, K LAU  - Bennell KLFAU - Wajswelner, HAU  - Wajswelner HLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - EnglandTA  - Br J Sports MedJT  - British journal of sports medicineJID - 0432520SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - AustraliaMH  - Football/*injuriesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - *Mental RecallMH  - Prospective StudiesMH  - Reproducibility of ResultsMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Sensitivity and SpecificityPMC - PMC1724702OID - NLM: PMC1724702EDAT- 2003/12/11 05:00MHDA- 2004/02/13 05:00CRDT- 2003/12/11 05:00PST - ppublishSO  - Br J Sports Med. 2003 Dec;37(6):545-7.PMID- 14658137OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20031208DCOM- 20040112LR  - 20131121IS  - 1476-3141 (Print)IS  - 1476-3141 (Linking)VI  - 1IP  - 1DP  - 2002 JanTI  - Training principles: evaluation of modes and methods of resistance training--a      coaching perspective.PG  - 79-103AB  - Current information and evidence indicate that for most activities free weight      training can produce superior results compared to training with machines,      particularly when the free weight training involves complex, multi-joint      exercises. A number of reasons can account for the superiority of free weights;      the major factor deals with mechanical specificity. Mechanical specificity is      concerned with appropriate movement patterns, force application and velocity of      movement. Considering the available evidence that adherence to the concept of      specificity of exercise and training can result in a greater transfer of training      effect then free weights should produce a more effective training transfer.      Therefore, the majority of resistance exercises making up a training programme      should include of free weight exercises with emphasis on mechanical specificity      (i.e. large muscle mass exercises, appropriate velocity, contraction type etc.).       Generally, machines should be used as an adjunct to free weight training and,      depending upon the sport, can be used to a greater or lesser extent during      various phases of the training period (preparation, pre-competition,      competition).FAU - Stone, MichaelAU  - Stone MAD  - Scottish Centre of Physical Education, Sport and Leisure Studies, University of      Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland.FAU - Plisk, StevenAU  - Plisk SFAU - Collins, DavidAU  - Collins DLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - ScotlandTA  - Sports BiomechJT  - Sports biomechanics / International Society of Biomechanics in SportsJID - 101151352SB  - IMMH  - Adaptation, Physiological/physiologyMH  - Biomechanical PhenomenaMH  - Exercise/*physiologyMH  - HumansMH  - Isometric Contraction/physiologyMH  - Muscle, Skeletal/physiologyMH  - Physical Education and Training/*methodsMH  - Sports EquipmentMH  - Weight Lifting/*physiologyRF  - 93EDAT- 2003/12/09 05:00MHDA- 2004/01/13 05:00CRDT- 2003/12/09 05:00AID - 10.1080/14763140208522788 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Sports Biomech. 2002 Jan;1(1):79-103.PMID- 24688275OWN - NLMSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINEDA  - 20140401DCOM- 20140401LR  - 20140408IS  - 1303-2968 (Electronic)IS  - 1303-2968 (Linking)VI  - 2IP  - 4DP  - 2003 DecTI  - Kinematic determinants of early acceleration in field sport athletes.PG  - 144-50AB  - Acceleration performance is important for field sport athletes that require a      high level of repeat sprint ability. Although acceleration is widely trained for,      there is little evidence outlining which kinematic factors delineate between good      and poor acceleration. The aim of this study was to investigate the kinematic      differences between individuals with fast and slow acceleration. Twenty field      sport athletes were tested for sprint ability over the first three steps of a 15m      sprint. Subjects were filmed at high speed to determine a range of lower body      kinematic measures. For data analysis, subjects were then divided into relatively      fast (n = 10) and slow (n = 10) groups based on their horizontal velocity. Groups      were then compared across kinematic measures, including stride length and      frequency, to determine whether they accounted for observed differences in sprint      velocity. The results showed the fast group had significantly lower (~11-13%)      left and right foot contact times (p < .05), and an increased stride frequency      (~9%), as compared to the slow group. Knee extension was also significantly      different between groups (p < .05). There was no difference found in stride      length. It was concluded that those subjects who are relatively fast in early      acceleration achieve this through reduced ground contact times resulting in an      improved stride frequency. Training for improved acceleration should be directed       towards using coaching instructions and drills that specifically train such      movement adaptations.FAU - Murphy, Aron JAU  - Murphy AJAD  - Human Performance Laboratory, School of Leisure, Sport and Tourism, University of      Technology , Sydney, Australia.FAU - Lockie, Robert GAU  - Lockie RGAD  - Human Performance Laboratory, School of Leisure, Sport and Tourism, University of      Technology , Sydney, Australia.FAU - Coutts, Aaron JAU  - Coutts AJAD  - Human Performance Laboratory, School of Leisure, Sport and Tourism, University of      Technology , Sydney, Australia.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticleDEP - 20031201PL  - TurkeyTA  - J Sports Sci MedJT  - Journal of sports science & medicineJID - 101174629PMC - PMC3963247OID - NLM: PMC3963247OTO - NOTNLMOT  - Sprint performanceOT  - first step quicknessOT  - running speedEDAT- 2003/12/01 00:00MHDA- 2003/12/01 00:01CRDT- 2014/04/02 06:00PHST- 2003/12 [ecollection]PHST- 2003/06/02 [received]PHST- 2003/10/10 [accepted]PHST- 2003/12/01 [epublish]PST - epublishSO  - J Sports Sci Med. 2003 Dec 1;2(4):144-50. eCollection 2003 Dec.PMID- 14626368OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20031119DCOM- 20040408LR  - 20051116IS  - 0264-0414 (Print)IS  - 0264-0414 (Linking)VI  - 21IP  - 11DP  - 2003 NovTI  - The coach-athlete relationship: a motivational model.PG  - 883-904AB  - The aim of this paper is to present a motivational model of the coach-athlete      relationship that describes how coaches may influence athletes' motivation. In      line with cognitive evaluation theory (Deci and Ryan, 1980, 1985) and the      hierarchical model of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation (Vallerand, 1997, 2000),      a motivational sequence is proposed where coaches' personal orientation towards      coaching, the context within which they operate, and their perceptions of their      athletes' behaviour and motivation influence coaches' behaviours. Also, coaches'       behaviours in the form of autonomy-supportive behaviours, provision of structure       and involvement have a beneficial impact on athletes' needs for autonomy,      competence and relatedness, which, in turn, nurture athletes' intrinsic      motivation and self-determined types of extrinsic motivation. Here, we first      review coaches' autonomy-supportive behaviours. We then describe the      psychological processes through which coaching behaviours have a positive      influence on athletes' intrinsic and self-determined extrinsic motivation.      Finally, we identify social and personality processes that determine coaching      behaviours.FAU - Mageau, Genevieve AAU  - Mageau GAAD  - Laboratoire de recherche sur le comportement social, Departement de psychologie,       Universite du Quebec a Montreal, Case Postale 8888, Succursale Centre-Ville,      Montreal, Quebec H3C 3P8, Canada.FAU - Vallerand, Robert JAU  - Vallerand RJLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - EnglandTA  - J Sports SciJT  - Journal of sports sciencesJID - 8405364SB  - IMMH  - BehaviorMH  - HumansMH  - Internal-External ControlMH  - *Interpersonal RelationsMH  - *Models, PsychologicalMH  - *MotivationMH  - Personal AutonomyMH  - PersonalityMH  - Social SupportMH  - Sports/*psychologyRF  - 158EDAT- 2003/11/25 05:00MHDA- 2004/04/09 05:00CRDT- 2003/11/25 05:00AID - 10.1080/0264041031000140374 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Sci. 2003 Nov;21(11):883-904.PMID- 14609144OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20031111DCOM- 20040129LR  - 20061115IS  - 1440-2440 (Print)VI  - 6IP  - 3DP  - 2003 SepTI  - Development of an anaerobic capacity test for field sport athletes.PG  - 275-84AB  - Maximally accumulated oxygen deficit (MAOD) has been argued to be currently the      best non-invasive method for estimating anaerobic capacity (Medbo et al., 1988,      Ramsbottom et al., 1997). An easy to administer field test that could accurately       predict MAOD, would be of great use to many field sport athletes and coaches.      Fifteen male rugby union players undertook MAOD testing (99.4 +/- 16.9ml x      kg(-1)) on a treadmill using a modification of procedure 3 as described by Medbo       et al. (1988). All subjects also performed a 300m Shuttle Run Test (66.7 +/-      2.2s), run over a 20m distance. Analysis of the MAOD and 300m Shuttle Run Test      time relationship revealed a significant correlation of r = -0.69 [p<0.01).      Furthermore, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that when subjects      were split into 'good' and 'poor' groups based on 300m Shuttle Run Test times,      the times distinguished between 'good' and 'poor' MAOD values (P<0.05). The      findings of the present study support the validity of the 300m Shuttle Run Test      as a useful estimate of anaerobic capacity in football athletes. Unexplained      variance could be due to speed and agility factors associated with the 300m      Shuttle Run Test. Methodological issues pertaining to the accurate assessment of       MAOD are also discussed.FAU - Moore, AAU  - Moore AAD  - School of Leisure, Sport and Tourism, University of Technology, Sydney, New South      Wales, Australia.FAU - Murphy, AAU  - Murphy ALA  - engPT  - Clinical TrialPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - AustraliaTA  - J Sci Med SportJT  - Journal of science and medicine in sport / Sports Medicine AustraliaJID - 9812598SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Anaerobic Threshold/*physiologyMH  - Exercise/*physiologyMH  - Football/*physiologyMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Running/physiologyMH  - Sports Medicine/*instrumentationMH  - Task Performance and AnalysisEDAT- 2003/11/12 05:00MHDA- 2004/01/30 05:00CRDT- 2003/11/12 05:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Sci Med Sport. 2003 Sep;6(3):275-84.PMID- 14594193OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20031103DCOM- 20040609LR  - 20061115IS  - 0231-424X (Print)IS  - 0231-424X (Linking)VI  - 90IP  - 3DP  - 2003TI  - Relationship of anthropometrical, physiological and motor attributes to      sport-specific skills.PG  - 225-31AB  - The purpose of this pilot study was to investigate the importance of the      athlete's motor capabilities in success in sport.

The subjects were      seven elite basketball players. At the end of the competitive season, the      anthropometrical and physiological features were measured to establish the      physical fitness of the subjects. Both general and sport-specific motor tests      were done. The coach estimated the performance of each player during the games of      the competitive season.

Two hundred ninety male (n = 88) and female      (n = 202) young athletes (M = 16.6 years, SD = 1.48) completed the Perceptions of      Success Questionnaire (POSQ, Roberts, Treasure, & Balague, 1998) to assess      dispositional goal orientations and the Sport Imagery Questionnaire (Hall, Mack,       Paivio, & Hausenblas, 1998) to assess frequency and function of imagery use. A      two-stage cluster analysis on the POSQ scores revealed a three-cluster solution      with a multivariate analysis of variance indicating significant differences among      cluster groups in imagery use. Athletes in Cluster 3 (higher task/higher ego)      used significantly more imagery, regardless of the function than athletes in      Cluster 1 (lower task/moderate ego) or Cluster 2 (moderate task/lower ego).

Injuries to the wrist were the most frequent      presentation accounting for 30 fractures and 30 soft tissue injuries (25%). The      majority of children were discharged from the A&E department after treatment      (71%). 26% were reviewed at out-patient clinics and 3% required hospital      admission. No children were referred for physiotherapy. CONCLUSION: Children      participate in sport and can be injured. The majority of sports injuries      presenting to an A&E department appear to be of a minor nature and could be      managed with simple first aid techniques by parents, teachers and coaches at the       scene or by attending primary care in the first instance. Supervision of      children, participation in organised sport and the use of protection devices may       help to prevent serious injury.FAU - Boyce, S HAU  - Boyce SHAD  - A&E Dept., Crosshouse Hospital, Kilmarnock. steveboyce_scotland@yahoo.comFAU - Quigley, M AAU  - Quigley MALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - ScotlandTA  - Scott Med JJT  - Scottish medical journalJID - 2983335RSB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Athletic Injuries/*epidemiologyMH  - ChildMH  - Emergency Service, Hospital/*statistics & numerical dataMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Prospective StudiesMH  - Retrospective StudiesMH  - Scotland/epidemiologyMH  - SportsEDAT- 2003/09/13 05:00MHDA- 2004/01/06 05:00CRDT- 2003/09/13 05:00PST - ppublishSO  - Scott Med J. 2003 Aug;48(3):88-90.PMID- 12966020OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20030910DCOM- 20031105LR  - 20081120IS  - 1353-8047 (Print)IS  - 1353-8047 (Linking)VI  - 9IP  - 3DP  - 2003 SepTI  - Immediate care of school sport injury.PG  - 270-3AB  - School sport is a major cause of injury in the post-primary age group. The      importance of primary prevention in sport has been identified; however secondary       prevention of school related sport injury has not been described in Ireland. A      random sample of 450 schools in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland was       studied using a postal questionnaire. Current management of sport injury, with      particular interest in the expertise and training of teachers and coaches, was      explored. Replies were received from 333 (74%) schools. There was no physical      education teacher with up to date first aid training in 37% schools. Immediate      care in terms of mechanisms and equipment to deal with injury was available in      35%-81% of schools responding. Correct response ranged from 65%-90% to four      scenarios: commonly presenting yet potentially serious management problems. This       study demonstrated deficiencies in sport injury care. In addition to concern      about current training, a need for basic life support training is highlighted.      These findings have implications for the prevention of school sports injuries.FAU - Abernethy, LAU  - Abernethy LAD  - Accident and Emergency Department, Ulster Hospital, Dundonald, Belfast, UK.      liz.abernethy@btopenworld.comFAU - MacAuley, DAU  - MacAuley DFAU - McNally, OAU  - McNally OFAU - McCann, SAU  - McCann SLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - EnglandTA  - Inj PrevJT  - Injury prevention : journal of the International Society for Child and Adolescent      Injury PreventionJID - 9510056SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Athletic Injuries/epidemiology/*therapyMH  - ChildMH  - EmergenciesMH  - FacultyMH  - First Aid/*methodsMH  - Health EducationMH  - HospitalizationMH  - HumansMH  - Ireland/epidemiologyMH  - Life Support CareMH  - Northern Ireland/epidemiologyMH  - Physical Education and Training/manpowerMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - *SchoolsPMC - PMC1730995OID - NLM: PMC1730995EDAT- 2003/09/11 05:00MHDA- 2003/11/06 05:00CRDT- 2003/09/11 05:00PST - ppublishSO  - Inj Prev. 2003 Sep;9(3):270-3.PMID- 12959621OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20030908DCOM- 20040122LR  - 20131121IS  - 0112-1642 (Print)IS  - 0112-1642 (Linking)VI  - 33IP  - 11DP  - 2003TI  - The relevance of melatonin to sports medicine and science.PG  - 809-31AB  - The pineal hormone, melatonin, has widespread effects on the body. The aim of      this review is to consider the specific interactions between melatonin and human       physiological functions associated with sport and exercise medicine. Separate      researchers have reported that melatonin concentrations increase, decrease and      remain unaffected by bouts of exercise. Such conflicting findings may be      explained by inter-study differences in lighting conditions and the time of day      the study participants have exercised. Age and fitness status have also been      identified as intervening factors in exercise-mediated changes in melatonin      concentration. The administration of exogenous melatonin leads to hypnotic and      hypothermic responses in humans, which can be linked to immediate reductions in      short-term mental and physical performance. Depending on the dose of melatonin,      these effects may still be apparent 3-5 hours after administration for some types      of cognitive performance, but effects on physical performance seem more      short-lived. The hypothesis that the hypothermic effects of melatonin lead to      improved endurance performance in hot environments is not supported by evidence      from studies involving military recruits who exercised at relatively low      intensities. Nevertheless, no research group has examined such a hypothesis with       athletes as study participants and with the associated more intense levels of      exercise. The fact that melatonin has also been found to preserve muscle and      liver glycogen in exercised rats adds weight to the notion that melatonin might      affect endurance exercise in humans. Melatonin has been successfully used to      alleviate jet lag symptoms of travellers and there is also a smaller amount of      evidence that the hormone helps shiftworkers adjust to nocturnal regimens.      Nevertheless, the symptoms of jet lag and shiftwork problems have primarily      included sleep characteristics rather than performance variables. The few studies      that have involved athletes and performance-related symptoms have produced      equivocal results. Melatonin has also been found to be useful for treating some      sleeping disorders, but interactions between sleep, melatonin and exercise have      not been studied extensively with trained study participants. It is unknown      whether melatonin plays a role in some exercise training-related problems such as      amenorrhoea and over-training syndrome.FAU - Atkinson, GregAU  - Atkinson GAD  - School of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Loughborough University, Loughborough,      Leicestershire, UK.

Factors      associated with these poorer health outcomes include geographical isolation,      population declines, limited health care provision and higher levels of      inactivity compared to urban areas. The mental, social and physical health of      individuals and communities in rural areas can be improved through active      participation in sport and recreation activities. Unfortunately, participation in      such activities can potentially lead to injury. There is a suggestion that there       is an increased risk of sports injuries in rural areas due to the lack of health       professionals and coaching personnel, fewer available volunteers to organise and       deliver sport, and the general attitude towards injuries in rural settings.      RESULTS: There is very limited information about the number and types of injuries      sustained during participation in sports activities in rural and regional      settings. This is largely related to a lack of formal sporting structures and      support mechanisms including research funding and trained personnel. CONCLUSION:       A range of factors need to be implemented to improve safety for sporting and      recreational participants in these areas. These include improved monitoring of      injury occurrence, stronger promotion of safety initiatives and wider      implementation of education strategies.FAU - Finch, CarolineAU  - Finch CAD  - Sports Injury Prevention Research Unit, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria,      Australia.

DESIGN AND SETTING: Data on catastrophic head       injuries were compiled in a national surveillance system maintained by the      National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury Research. The data were compiled      with the assistance of coaches, athletic trainers, athletic directors, executive       officers of state and national athletic organizations, a national newspaper      clipping service, professional associates of the researchers, and national sport       organizations. SUBJECTS: Data included all high school and college athletic      programs in the United States. MEASUREMENTS: Background information on the      athlete (age, height, weight, experience, previous injury, etc), accident      information, immediate and postaccident medical care, type of injury, and      equipment involved. Autopsy reports were used when available. RESULTS: A      football-related fatality has occurred every year from 1945 through 1999, except       for 1990. Head-related deaths accounted for 69% of football fatalities, cervical       spinal injuries for 16.3%, and other injuries for 14.7%. High school football      produced the greatest number of football head-related deaths. From 1984 through      1999, 69 football head-related injuries resulted in permanent disability.      Sixty-three of the injuries were associated with high school football and 6 with       college football. Although football has received the most attention, other sports      have also been associated with head-related deaths and permanent disability      injuries. From 1982 through 1999, 20 deaths and 19 permanent disability injuries       occurred in a variety of sports. Track and field, baseball, and cheerleading had       the highest incidence of these catastrophic injuries. Three deaths and 3 injuries      resulting in permanent disability have occurred in female participants.      CONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS: Reliable data collection systems and continual      analysis of the data can help us to reduce the number of catastrophic      head-related injuries.

I investigated the efficacy of      standardized mental status testing on the sport sideline to detect abnormalities       that result from concussion and provide an objective measure of postinjury      cognitive recovery. DESIGN AND SETTING: All subjects underwent a standardized      preseason baseline mental status evaluation. Standardized testing of injured and       uninjured control subjects was repeated on the sideline immediately after      concussion and 48 hours after injury. SUBJECTS: Sixty-three high school and      collegiate football players with concussion and 55 uninjured control subjects      were studied. MEASUREMENTS: The Standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC) was      administered to evaluate neurocognitive functioning and neurologic status.      RESULTS: Immediately after concussion, injured subjects performed significantly      below preinjury baseline and below uninjured controls on the SAC. Measurable      deficits in orientation, concentration, and memory were evident immediately after      concussion. A decline in SAC score at time of injury was 95% sensitive and 76%      specific in accurately classifying injured and uninjured subjects on the      sideline. Injured subjects demonstrated significant improvements in SAC score 48       hours after injury. CONCLUSIONS: Standardized mental status testing can be a      valuable tool to assist the sports medicine clinician in detecting the immediate       effects of concussion on mental status, tracking resolution of immediate      postconcussive mental status abnormalities, and making more informed decisions on      return to play after injury.FAU - McCrea, MichaelAU  - McCrea MAD  - Waukesha Memorial Hospital, Waukesha, WI; Medical College of Wisconsin,      Milwaukee, WI.LA  - ENGPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLETA  - J Athl TrainJT  - Journal of athletic trainingJID - 9301647PMC - PMC155418EDAT- 2003/08/26 05:00MHDA- 2003/08/26 05:00CRDT- 2003/08/26 05:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Athl Train. 2001 Sep;36(3):274-279.PMID- 12931079OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20030821DCOM- 20030825LR  - 20080214IS  - 1545-861X (Electronic)IS  - 0149-2195 (Linking)VI  - 52IP  - 33DP  - 2003 Aug 22TI  - Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections among competitive sports      participants--Colorado, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and Los Angeles County, 2000-2003.PG  - 793-5AB  - Although outbreaks of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) usually       have been associated with health-care institutions, MRSA is emerging as a cause      of skin infections in the community.

Furthermore, an attempt was made to      transfer these data to training recommendations. Thirty-four female rowers of      national and international level performed a 4 x 6 min incremental graded      exercise test GXT(boat) in coxless pairs on a lake (6 km, no wind, no waves). The      boat velocity on the water (V; measured by a speedometer PACE COACH) was      increased continuously from 3.55 m x s-I to 4.03 m x s-1. The individual      anaerobic threshold(IAT) was determined by means of the lactate (LA) kinetics      during and after exercise. Within 28 days all subjects performed arowing      ergometry test GXT(ergo); Gjessing rowing ergometer: 40 watts increments every 3       min) as well as 70 min of constant endurance training in the boat in moderate      velocity (ET; n- 10 pairs because of changing weather conditions). Results for      V/LAIHR at IAT are: GXT(boat): 3.84+/- 0.10 m x s-1/2.44 +/- 0.66 mmol x 1-1/172       + 11 min(-1); GXT(ergo): 206+/-10 watts/2.53 +0.40 mmol x 1-171 +/- 10 min-'      (means+/-SD). The Spearman rank order test showed significant correlations for HR      (p < 0.001) and the mean performances of the coxless pairs (p < 0.05). A'5 %      lower V during ET lead to a 10% lower HR and a 30% lower LA compared to the      values at IAT. In conclusion, both a performance specific evaluation and velocity      oriented control of training are possible by means of a 4 x 6 min incremental      graded exercise test in coxlesspairs. However, this test on the water requires      almost perfect weather conditions. The HR recommendations based on GXT (ergo)      were confirmed during GXT(boat).FAU - Coen, BAU  - Coen BAD  - Institute of Sports- und Preventive Medicine, University of Saarland,      Saarbrucken, Germany. b.coen@rz.uni-sb.deFAU - Urhausen, AAU  - Urhausen AFAU - Kindermann, WAU  - Kindermann WLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Validation StudiesPL  - GermanyTA  - Int J Sports MedJT  - International journal of sports medicineJID - 8008349RN  - 33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Anaerobic ThresholdMH  - ErgometryMH  - *Exercise TestMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart RateMH  - HumansMH  - Lactic Acid/bloodMH  - Physical EnduranceMH  - *SportsEDAT- 2003/08/09 05:00MHDA- 2005/04/05 09:00CRDT- 2003/08/09 05:00AID - 10.1055/s-2003-41178 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Int J Sports Med. 2003 Aug;24(6):428-32.PMID- 12894930OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20030804DCOM- 20030917LR  - 20091111IS  - 0002-9157 (Print)IS  - 0002-9157 (Linking)VI  - 46IP  - 1DP  - 2003 JulTI  - The hypnotic belay in alpine mountaineering: the use of self-hypnosis for the      resolution of sports injuries and for performance enhancement.PG  - 45-51AB  - The author, an experienced alpine mountaineer, sustained several traumatic      climbing injuries over a two-year period. This article describes her multiple      uses of self-hypnosis to deal with several challenges related to her returning to      successful mountain climbing. She used self-hypnosis for physical healing and to       enhance her motivation to resume climbing. While training for her next      expedition, she successfully utilized self-hypnotic techniques to deal with acute      stress and later post-traumatic symptoms that had emerged related to her climbing      injuries. She describes her use of hypnotic ego-strengthening, mental rehearsal,       age progression, and "Inner Strength" as well as active-alert trance states. Her       successful summitting of Ecuador's Cotopaxi at 19,380 feet was facilitated by      "The Hypnotic Belay" which permitted her to secure herself by self-hypnosis in      addition to the rope used to secure climbers.

ASSESSMENT OF PREDICTOR VARIABLES: On-field presence      of disorientation, posttraumatic amnesia, retrograde amnesia, and loss of      consciousness. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: ImPACT, a computerized neuropsychological      test battery, was administered pre-season and, on average, 2 days postinjury.      Good postinjury presentation (n = 44) was defined as no measurable change,      relative to baseline, in terms of both ImPACT memory and symptom composite      scores. Poor presentation (n = 34) was defined as a 10-point increase in symptom       reporting and 10-point decrease in memory functioning (exceeding the 80%      confidence interval for measurement error on ImPACT). Athletes failing to meet      good or poor selection criteria (n = 61) were not included in the analysis.      RESULTS: Odds ratios revealed that athletes demonstrating poor presentation at 2       days postinjury were over 10 times more likely (P < 0.001) to have exhibited      retrograde amnesia following concussive injury when compared with athletes      exhibiting good presentation. Similarly, athletes with poor presentation were      over 4 times more likely (P < 0.013) to have exhibited posttraumatic amnesia and       at least 5 minutes of mental status change. There were no differences between      good and poor presentation groups in terms of on-field loss of consciousness.      CONCLUSIONS: The presence of amnesia, not loss of consciousness, appears      predictive of symptom and neurocognitive deficits following concussion in      athletes. Athletes presenting with on-field amnesia should undergo comprehensive       and individualized assessment prior to returning to sport participation.      Continued refinement of sports concussion grading scales is warranted in lieu of       consistent findings that brief loss of consciousness is not predictive of      concussion injury severity.FAU - Collins, Michael WAU  - Collins MWAD  - UPMC Sports Concussion Program, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Center for      Sports Medicine, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, 3200 South Water      Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15203, U.S.A. collinsmw@msx.upmc.eduFAU - Iverson, Grant LAU  - Iverson GLFAU - Lovell, Mark RAU  - Lovell MRFAU - McKeag, Douglas BAU  - McKeag DBFAU - Norwig, JohnAU  - Norwig JFAU - Maroon, JosephAU  - Maroon JLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Clin J Sport MedJT  - Clinical journal of sport medicine : official journal of the Canadian Academy of       Sport MedicineJID - 9103300SB  - IMCIN - Clin J Sport Med. 2004 Jul;14(4):253.

METHODS: Two hundred and      eighty-two elite young athletes (aged 8 to 17 yrs) and their parents were      interviewed in their homes to identify how and why they started intensive      training. RESULTS: Of the 4 sports studied (soccer, gymnastics, tennis, and      swimming), parents of swimmers were more likely introduce their children to the      sport (70%), while parents of gymnasts (42%) were the least likely to do so.      However, in this sports parents played a lesser role in the transition to      intensive training (6% and 5%, respectively). Nearly half the soccer players      (47%) became involved in the sport because of their own interest, with the      majority making the transition to intensive training because of encouragement by       a coach (65%). Self-motivation (27%) and parental influence (57%) brought      children into tennis with 25% of the young athletes in the sample autonomously      deciding to start intensive training. Children from the lower socio-economic      classes were underrepresented, and the total number of 1-parent families (5.3%)      was considerably less than current British national norms (16.1%). CONCLUSION: In      Britain, young athletes' involvement in high level sport is heavily dependent on       their parents, with sports clubs and coaches playing an important later role. In       the present socio-economic and cultural situation, many talented youngsters with       less motivated parents will not undertake sport. Talented youngsters from a      poorer economic background will be heavily disadvantaged, especially in sports      such as tennis.FAU - Baxter-Jones, A D GAU  - Baxter-Jones ADAD  - College of Kinesiology, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada.FAU - Maffulli, NAU  - Maffulli NCN  - TOYA Study GroupLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - ItalyTA  - J Sports Med Phys FitnessJT  - The Journal of sports medicine and physical fitnessJID - 0376337SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - ChildMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - Interviews as TopicMH  - MaleMH  - *Parent-Child RelationsMH  - *Social SupportMH  - Socioeconomic FactorsMH  - Sports/*psychologyEDAT- 2003/07/11 05:00MHDA- 2003/10/08 05:00CRDT- 2003/07/11 05:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Med Phys Fitness. 2003 Jun;43(2):250-5.PMID- 12853898OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20030710DCOM- 20031007LR  - 20061115IS  - 0022-4707 (Print)IS  - 0022-4707 (Linking)VI  - 43IP  - 2DP  - 2003 JunTI  - Prevention of knee injuries in sports. A systematic review of the literature.PG  - 165-79AB  - AIM: We reviewed evidence regarding risk factors associated with incidence of      knee injuries both to assess the effectiveness of prevention strategies, and to      offer evidence-based recommendations to physicians, coaches, trainers, athletes,       and researchers. METHODS: We searched electronic data bases without language      restriction for the years 1966 - September 1, 2001, identified citations from      reference sections of research papers retrieved, contacted experts in the field,       and searched the Cochrane Collaboration. Of the 328 citations identified, we      emphasized the results from the 13 reports that compared alternative methods to      prevent knee injury and assessed the methodologic quality of these reports using       a standardized instrument. RESULTS: Five studies addressed the effectiveness of      bracing in football players; these studies showed no consistent evidence of      benefit. Two studies comparing alternative cleat designs and a controlled study      testing the effects of adjustments in the ski boot/binding system were difficult       to interpret because of inadequate reporting of methodology. Six prospective      studies that addressed the impact of conditioning and training showed promise of       proprioception and neuromuscular training for protection against knee injury. We       identified serious flaws in study design, control of bias, and statistical      methods; the median quality scores ranged from 11 to 56 (out of 100). CONCLUSION:      Structured training programs that emphasize neuromuscular and proprioceptive      training offer encouraging evidence for the prevention of knee injuries. However,      flaws in study design and implementation have limited the effectiveness of work      in this field. A rigorously implemented research program is needed to address      this critically important sports medicine problem.FAU - Thacker, S BAU  - Thacker SBAD  - Epidemiology Program Office, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta,      GA 30333, USA.FAU - Stroup, D FAU  - Stroup DFFAU - Branche, C MAU  - Branche CMFAU - Gilchrist, JAU  - Gilchrist JFAU - Goodman, R AAU  - Goodman RAFAU - Porter Kelling, EAU  - Porter Kelling ELA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.PT  - ReviewPL  - ItalyTA  - J Sports Med Phys FitnessJT  - The Journal of sports medicine and physical fitnessJID - 0376337SB  - IMMH  - Athletic Injuries/*prevention & controlMH  - HumansMH  - Knee Injuries/*prevention & controlMH  - Research DesignMH  - Risk FactorsRF  - 198EDAT- 2003/07/11 05:00MHDA- 2003/10/08 05:00CRDT- 2003/07/11 05:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Med Phys Fitness. 2003 Jun;43(2):165-79.PMID- 12852686OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20030710DCOM- 20030820LR  - 20131121IS  - 0278-5919 (Print)IS  - 0278-5919 (Linking)VI  - 22IP  - 3DP  - 2003 JulTI  - Acute and long-term management of sports-related closed head injuries.PG  - 559-76AB  - Aggressive participation in athletics is rewarded in many ways in our society. As      long as there is such strong impetus for participation in athletics, the risks of      head injuries for participants will remain. Important strides made in      understanding of the pathophysiology of head injuries may lead to improved      treatment strategies in the future. In light of the current lack of effective      therapies, however, the best options remain injury prevention, early and      appropriate recognition, and limitation of subsequent, further injury. Frequently      the medical staff is encouraged to allow the athlete to return to play based on      the desires of the coach, team, fans, parents, and even the athlete himself. A      thorough understanding of the potentially serious risks of repetitive injury,      however, mandates that only a proper conservative period of observation and      evaluation will best serve the competitor.FAU - Asthagiri, Ashok RAU  - Asthagiri ARAD  - Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Virginia School of Medicine,      Box 212, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.FAU - Dumont, Aaron SAU  - Dumont ASFAU - Sheehan, Jonas MAU  - Sheehan JMLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Clin Sports MedJT  - Clinics in sports medicineJID - 8112473SB  - IMMH  - Acute DiseaseMH  - Athletic Injuries/diagnosis/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - Biomechanical PhenomenaMH  - Brain Concussion/prevention & controlMH  - Head Injuries, Closed/diagnosis/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - HumansMH  - Long-Term Care/methodsMH  - Neurologic Examination/methodsMH  - Practice Guidelines as TopicMH  - Recovery of FunctionMH  - Sports Medicine/*methodsRF  - 38EDAT- 2003/07/11 05:00MHDA- 2003/08/21 05:00CRDT- 2003/07/11 05:00PST - ppublishSO  - Clin Sports Med. 2003 Jul;22(3):559-76.PMID- 12848713OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20030709DCOM- 20030924LR  - 20041117IS  - 1600-4469 (Print)IS  - 1600-4469 (Linking)VI  - 19IP  - 4DP  - 2003 AugTI  - Knowledge and attitudes of coaches of secondary school athletes in Ibadan,      Nigeria regarding oro-facial injuries and mouthguard use by the athletes.PG  - 204-8AB  - - The objective of this study was to assess the perceptions of secondary school      sports' coaches about oro-facial injuries and mouth protector usage in sports by       the adolescent athletes. A 10-item, self-completion questionnaire was distributed      to 42 coaches from 23 secondary schools randomly selected from different parts of      Ibadan city in Nigeria between May and June, 2002. The questionnaire sought      information on why a mouth protector (mouthguard) is used, when it is required;      the types of mouth protector used, the major reasons for choosing a specific      mouth protector, and personal feeling as to whether mouthguards prevent oral      injury. Descriptive statistics were used for the data while the chi-square      statistic was employed to test the significance of association between variables.      All the coaches, 25 (59.5%) males and 17 (40.5%) females with age range of 19-51       years and mean age of 38.07 +/- 8.97 years (mean +/- SD), completed and returned       the forms (100% completion rate). 95.2% of the coaches believed that mouthguards       prevent oral injuries and 95.2% of them also would like more information on      different types of mouthguard, while 4.8% each felt otherwise. The main factor      determining the choice of the type of mouthguard for athletes by the coaches was       the quality of oral protection (57.1%), and the next was the cost (23.8%).      Acceptance of mouthguard was scored as positive by 88.1% of the athletes. 81.0%      of the coaches felt that mouthguard should be worn at all times (during practices      and competitions) while 19.0% would prefer the use during competitions only. The       majority of the coaches (71.4%) believed that boxing needs mouthguards, 2.4% each      indicated football (soccer) and Judo while 11.9% of the coaches did not indicate       any sport. The majority of these Nigerian coaches agreed on the protective      effectiveness of mouthguard against sport-related oro-facial injuries, but they      are yet to be adequately informed about mouthguards generally so as to correctly       advise and influence these adolescent athletes in this regard.FAU - Onyeaso, C OAU  - Onyeaso COAD  - Lecturer/Consultant Orthodontist, Department of Preventive Dentistry, College of       Medicine/University College Hospital, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria.FAU - Adegbesan, O AAU  - Adegbesan OALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - DenmarkTA  - Dent TraumatolJT  - Dental traumatology : official publication of International Association for      Dental TraumatologyJID - 101091305SB  - DMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - Athletic Injuries/*prevention & controlMH  - *Attitude to HealthMH  - BoxingMH  - Chi-Square DistributionMH  - Facial Injuries/*prevention & controlMH  - FemaleMH  - *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, PracticeMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Martial ArtsMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Mouth/*injuriesMH  - *Mouth Protectors/classification/utilizationMH  - NigeriaMH  - SoccerMH  - SportsMH  - *Sports Equipment/classificationEDAT- 2003/07/10 05:00MHDA- 2003/09/25 05:00CRDT- 2003/07/10 05:00AID - 163 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Dent Traumatol. 2003 Aug;19(4):204-8.PMID- 12831679OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20030630DCOM- 20060103IS  - 1537-890X (Print)IS  - 1537-890X (Linking)VI  - 1IP  - 6DP  - 2002 DecTI  - Minor traumatic brain injury in sports.PG  - 323-6AB  - Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) is an all-too-frequent occurrence among      amateur and professional athletes alike. The increased attention it has received       in recent literature may suggest that incidence of this injury has risen. The      frequency of MTBI in general may be rising with the increased interest in      so-called noncontact sports such as soccer, snowboarding, skateboarding, and      motocross. Despite significant improvements made in the quality of protective      equipment, head injury remains common in football, soccer, and amateur boxing.      The management of athletes who suffer traumatic head injury remains problematic      for coaches, trainers, team physicians, primary care physicians, and neurologic      specialists.

A total of 321 surveys were mailed to      Division I strength and conditioning coaches, and the response rate was 42.7%      (137 of 321 surveys). Results indicate that all subjects held a baccalaureate      degree, the majority in a human performance-related field, and that 75% were      Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist (CSCS) certified. The respondents'      most widely utilized professional resources were the Strength and Conditioning      Journal (94%) and other collegiate coaches and programs (93%). Forty-seven      percent of respondents indicated that other collegiate coaches and their programs      were the most important sources of knowledge outside of formal education. The      majority indicated that they used a periodization protocol (93%) utilizing      multiple sets (97%), plyometrics (90%), explosive movements (88%), and Olympic      lifts (85%). Respondents tend to rely on sources of information that may not be      defined as scientific, as evidenced by the low priority given to peer-reviewed      literature.

Of these, 13 were professional footballers, four      professional cricketers, three hockey players, one a tennis player and one a      golfer. Preoperative assessment included plain radiography, single      positron-emission CT, planar bone scanning and reverse-gantry CT. In all patients      the Oswestry disability index (ODI) and in 19 the Short-Form 36 (SF-36) scores      were determined preoperatively, and both were measured again after two years in      all patients. Three patients had a Scott's fusion and 19 a Buck's fusion. The      mean duration of back pain before surgery was 9.4 months (6 to 36). The mean size      of the defect as determined by CT was 3.5 mm (1 to 8) and the mean preoperative      and postoperative ODIs were 39.5 (SD 8.7) and 10.7 (SD 12.9), respectively.

In addition, the ability of these indices to differentiate healthy      controls from horses with mild RAO by separating the horses according to their      usage was investigated. The horses were assigned to three sporting categories: 1       Leisure horses; 2 Horses competing at events with a duration of more than five      minutes (eventing, coaching and endurance); and 3 Horses competing at events with      a duration of less than five minutes (dressage and show jumping). Flow-volume      curves were recorded with an ultrasonic spirometer and TBFVL indices were      calculated with specially dedicated software. The sporting usage of the horses      had a significant effect on the differentiating ability of TBFVL indices in      diagnosing different degrees of RAO.

Compared to the      competitive sports and Paralympic Games that physically and intellectually      disabled athletes have participated in, activities for the psychiatrically      disabled have not been well-organized. In this paper, we examine a number of      problems that have arisen when the psychiatrically disabled joined competitive      sports games. We identify two major characteristics of the psychiatrically      disabled of particular relevance when organizing competitive sports activities.      First, all psychiatrically disabled athletes need treatment of their individual      diseases. For example, psychiatric symptoms fluctuate markedly over time, unlike       physical or intellectual disabilities, whose symptoms are much more stable.      Exacerbations of psychiatric illness are also likely to occur due to the stresses      of competitiveness. Second, psychiatric disabilities are manifestations of      disorders in the central nervous system, which makes the classification of      psychiatric disabilities less straightforward than classification of the      physically disabled. These two characteristics require special attention when      organizing competitive athletic challenges that include the psychiatrically      disabled. However, promoting sports activities that include the psychiatrically      disabled would be expected to reduce the prejudice toward and subsequent social      disadvantages experienced by psychiatric patients. Thus, with careful planning to      successfully integrate psychiatrically disabled athletes, we expect increased      promotion of such sports activities in the future.FAU - Uchida, SunaoAU  - Uchida SAD  - Tokyo Institute of Psychiatry.FAU - Takahata, TakashiAU  - Takahata TFAU - Miyazaki, ShinichiAU  - Miyazaki SLA  - jpnPT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - JapanTA  - Seishin Shinkeigaku ZasshiJT  - Seishin shinkeigaku zasshi = Psychiatria et neurologia JaponicaJID - 9801787SB  - IMMH  - *Competitive BehaviorMH  - HumansMH  - Mentally Disabled Persons/*psychologyMH  - *Sports/trendsRF  - 7EDAT- 2003/03/26 04:00MHDA- 2003/05/15 05:00CRDT- 2003/03/26 04:00PST - ppublishSO  - Seishin Shinkeigaku Zasshi. 2002;104(12):1242-8.PMID- 24616603OWN - NLMSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINEDA  - 20140311DCOM- 20140624LR  - 20140624IS  - 1303-2968 (Electronic)IS  - 1303-2968 (Linking)VI  - 2IP  - 1DP  - 2003 MarTI  - Nurturing sport expertise: factors influencing the development of elite athlete.PG  - 1-9AB  - The development of expertise in sport is the result of successful interaction of       biological, psychological, and sociological constraints. This review examines the      training and environmental factors that influence the acquisition of sport      expertise. Research examining the quality and quantity of training indicate that       these two elements are crucial predictors of attainment. In addition, the      possession of resources such as parental support and adequate coaching are      essential. Social factors such as cultural influences and the relative age effect      are also considered as determinants of sport expertise. Although it is evident      that environmental factors are essential to the acquisition of high levels of      sport development, further research is clearly required.FAU - Baker, JosephAU  - Baker JAD  - School of Physical and Health Education Queen's University , Canada.FAU - Horton, SeanAU  - Horton SAD  - School of Physical and Health Education Queen's University , Canada.FAU - Robertson-Wilson, JenniferAU  - Robertson-Wilson JAD  - School of Physical and Health Education Queen's University , Canada.FAU - Wall, MichaelAU  - Wall MAD  - School of Physical and Health Education Queen's University , Canada.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewDEP - 20030301PL  - TurkeyTA  - J Sports Sci MedJT  - Journal of sports science & medicineJID - 101174629PMC - PMC3937568OID - NLM: PMC3937568OTO - NOTNLMOT  - ParentsOT  - coachingOT  - practiceOT  - skill-acquisitionEDAT- 2003/03/01 00:00MHDA- 2003/03/01 00:01CRDT- 2014/03/12 06:00PHST- 2003/03 [ecollection]PHST- 2002/09/16 [received]PHST- 2002/11/21 [accepted]PHST- 2003/03/01 [epublish]PST - epublishSO  - J Sports Sci Med. 2003 Mar 1;2(1):1-9. eCollection 2003 Mar.PMID- 12602199OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20030226DCOM- 20030324LR  - 20140130IS  - 0256-2855 (Print)VI  - 113IP  - 1DP  - 2003TI  - [Frequency and nature of anterior tooth injuries and the use of mouth protectors       in sports clubs in Bern].PG  - 20-6AB  - Tooth injuries are frequently associated with sports injuries. Most of them could      be minimized or prevented by the use of a mouthguard. The present study      investigated the occurrence of tooth injuries and the attitude of athletes of      Bernese sports clubs towards mouthguards, by means of a questionnaire and      clinical examination. A total of 172 out of 200 athletes from six sports clubs,      who were contacted directly at the sports fields, returned the questionnaire.      Fifty of them owned a mouthguard (= 29.1%) and 54 reported having suffered dental      trauma. The majority of athletes did not wear a mouthguard, despite acknowledging      its usefulness. Even after a dental injury, the rate of mouthguard-acceptance      increased just marginally; only 38.9% of all injured athletes were wearing a      mouthguard after dental trauma. Most of the athletes had not considered wearing a      mouthguard at all. For many of them, impairment of speech and breathing and      discomfort were reasons not to wear a mouthguard. Of the 54 reported athletes      with dental trauma, 48 were examined clinically. The upper central incisors were       by far the most frequently injured teeth. The clinical examination used an injury      severity index (NIDR-Index, National Institute of Dental Research) ranging from      grade 0 (no visible damage), to grade 6 (loss of tooth). The most common finding       was grade 4 (injuries that were treated by reconstruction). In conclusion there      is a need to optimize information for athletes concerning mouthguards and sports       injuries. Providing such information is not only the responsibility of coaches      and trainers, but also of dentists.FAU - Tschan, Jorg DAU  - Tschan JDAD  - Klinik fur Oralchirurgie und Stomatologie, Zahnmedizinische Kliniken der      Universitat Bern, Schweiz. joerg.tschan@zmk.unibe.chFAU - Rothlisberger, BeatAU  - Rothlisberger BFAU - Hegg, LorenzAU  - Hegg LFAU - von Arx, ThomasAU  - von Arx TLA  - gerPT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticleTT  - Haufigkeit und Art von Frontzahn-verletzungen und Gebrauch eines Zahnschutzes in       Berner Sportclubs.PL  - SwitzerlandTA  - Schweiz Monatsschr ZahnmedJT  - Schweizer Monatsschrift fur Zahnmedizin = Revue mensuelle suisse      d'odonto-stomatologie = Rivista mensile svizzera di odontologia e stomatologia /       SSOJID - 8709597SB  - DSB  - IMMH  - Athletic Injuries/epidemiology/*prevention & control/psychologyMH  - Attitude to HealthMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - Incisor/*injuriesMH  - MaleMH  - Mouth Protectors/*utilizationMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Switzerland/epidemiologyMH  - Tooth Injuries/epidemiology/*prevention & control/*psychologyMH  - Trauma Severity IndicesEDAT- 2003/02/27 04:00MHDA- 2003/03/26 04:00CRDT- 2003/02/27 04:00PST - ppublishSO  - Schweiz Monatsschr Zahnmed. 2003;113(1):20-6.PMID- 12578254OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20030211DCOM- 20030514LR  - 20061115IS  - 0031-5125 (Print)IS  - 0031-5125 (Linking)VI  - 95IP  - 3 Pt 2DP  - 2002 DecTI  - Relation between sport activity and mental rotation: comparison of three groups      of subjects.PG  - 1141-54AB  - The aim was to observe the relation between sport activity and performance on a      mental image-transformation task.

Both sport groups performed similarly      and obtained significantly shorter response times than those of the nonathletes.

The research uses a quasi-longitudinal observational study in a       secure unit, located in Southern England, and questions the suitability of      sporting activities used as a primary vehicle for, and mechanism of,      rehabilitation. Through the analysis of experiences at the unit, the paper      supports the use of those sporting activities which de-emphasise regulations and       winning, and argues for an emphasis on choice for participants, the tailoring of       programmes to suit individual needs, and on positive feedback. Sport evidently      has an important role in youth rehabilitation. However, it should be used      selectively because, if unsuitable activities and programmes are used, they may      have a detrimental effect on participants.

DESIGN: A prospective      study of New York State licensed professional boxers who underwent testing of      cognitive functioning before and after (within days, one week, and one month) a      professional bout. SETTING: Male professional athletes recruited from the New      York State Athletic Commission and local boxing gyms. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-six      licensed professional boxers were enrolled in the protocol. Data is presented on       the 18 participants who completed testing on at least three of the four time      points. INTERVENTIONS: Serial neuropsychological assessment before and after the       athletes engaged in competition. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Neuropsychological      measures of cognitive functioning, including new learning and memory, information      processing speed, and mental flexibility. RESULTS: A series of repeated measures       MANOVAS revealed significant within subject differences across testing on complex      information processing and verbal fluency. Post hoc analyses indicated      significant differences between time 1 (baseline) and time 4 (one month post),      with scores one month following the bout indicating significantly improved      performance. Memory scores did not change significantly across testing; however,       prior boxing exposure measured by total number of professional bouts was      associated with poorer memory performance. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive testing one      month following participation in a professional boxing bout yielded scores      suggestive of recovery to a level above the baseline. We conclude that baseline      assessment taken during periods of intense training are likely confounded by      other pre-bout conditions (i.e., sparring, rapid weight loss, pre-bout anxiety)      and do not represent true baseline abilities. Instability of performance      associated with mild head injury may complicate the interpretation of post-injury      assessments. Practice effects may also confound the interpretation of serial      assessments, leading to underestimation of the effects of sports related head      trauma. Poorer cognitive performance was evident during the presumed recovery      period in boxers with greater exposure to the sport (>12 professional bouts).      This finding is consistent with reports of a cumulative effect of repetitive head      trauma and the subsequent development of chronic traumatic brain injury. These      data have implications for assessing recovery of function following head injury      in players of other contact sports as well as determination of return-to-play      following an injury.FAU - Ravdin, Lisa DAU  - Ravdin LDAD  - Department of Neurology and Neurosciences, Weill Medical College of Cornell      University and New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York 10021, USA.      ldravin@med.cornell.eduFAU - Barr, William BAU  - Barr WBFAU - Jordan, BarryAU  - Jordan BFAU - Lathan, William EAU  - Lathan WEFAU - Relkin, Norman RAU  - Relkin NRLA  - engGR  - K08-NS02016/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United StatesGR  - M01RR00047/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.PL  - United StatesTA  - Clin J Sport MedJT  - Clinical journal of sport medicine : official journal of the Canadian Academy of       Sport MedicineJID - 9103300SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Boxing/*injuriesMH  - Brain Concussion/complications/*physiopathologyMH  - *CognitionMH  - Cognition Disorders/etiologyMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Neuropsychological TestsMH  - Prospective StudiesMH  - Trail Making TestEDAT- 2003/01/25 04:00MHDA- 2003/05/17 05:00CRDT- 2003/01/25 04:00PST - ppublishSO  - Clin J Sport Med. 2003 Jan;13(1):21-7.PMID- 12449939OWN - KIESTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20021125DCOM- 20021209LR  - 20041117IS  - 0735-7028 (Print)IS  - 0735-7028 (Linking)VI  - 32IP  - 1DP  - 2001 FebTI  - Sport psychology service delivery: staying ethical while keeping loose.PG  - 12-8AB  - Although the parent discipline of sport psychology is psychology, the delivery of      sport psychology services has its main roots in physical education and sports      science (motor learning and control, skill acquisition). Thus, sport      psychologists may look more like coaches than they look like clinicians or      counselors.

The factors were generated      from items obtained from the participants rather than items from the      experimenter. This was done to avoid the possible influence of preconceptions on       the part of the experimenter regarding what the final dimensions may be. Obtained      motivational factors were Social Reinforcement, Fringe Benefits, Fame and      Fortune, External Forces, Proving Oneself, Social Benefits, Mental Enrichment,      Expression of Self, Sense of Accomplishment, and Self-enhancement. Each factor      was referred to an intrinsic-extrinsic dimension to describe its relative      position on that dimension. The order of the factors as listed indicates      increasing intrinsic motivation. i.e., the first four factors were rated in the      extrinsic range, whereas the remaining six were rated to be in the intrinsic      range. Next, the participants rated the extent to which each of the various      factors was involved in their decision to participate in sport activities. The      pattern of use of the motivational factors was the same for both sexes except      that men indicated greater use of the Fringe Benefits factor. Overall, the more      intrinsic a sport motivation factor was rated, the more likely it was to be rated      as a factor in actual sport participation.FAU - Pedersen, Darhl MAU  - Pedersen DMAD  - Brigham Young University, Provo, UT 84602, USA. darhl_pedersen@byu.eduLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Percept Mot SkillsJT  - Perceptual and motor skillsJID - 0401131SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - IndividualityMH  - *Internal-External ControlMH  - MaleMH  - *MotivationMH  - Personality InventoryMH  - Self-AssessmentMH  - Social BehaviorMH  - Sports/*psychologyEDAT- 2002/11/19 04:00MHDA- 2003/03/28 05:00CRDT- 2002/11/19 04:00AID - 10.2466/pms.2002.95.2.459 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Percept Mot Skills. 2002 Oct;95(2):459-76.PMID- 12434829OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20021118DCOM- 20030327LR  - 20041117IS  - 0031-5125 (Print)IS  - 0031-5125 (Linking)VI  - 95IP  - 2DP  - 2002 OctTI  - Task familiarity and task efficacy: a study of sports coaches.PG  - 367-72AB  - The purpose of the study was to establish a profile of coaching efficacy with      Hong Kong community coaches who differ in knowledge and hours spent in coaching.       Coaching efficacy can be described in four dimensions, namely, Motivation,      Strategy, Technique, and Character Building. It was hypothesized that coaches who      had spent more time coaching and were more knowledgeable about the sport and      coaching would score higher on those four dimensions of a Coaching Efficacy      Scale. The scale was administered to 252 coaches working with beginning and      district-level athletes in a variety of sports. Analysis suggested that their      self-reported efficacy on Strategy was least strong. This means that the coaches       were not confident in analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of opposing teams,      making decisions on the type of game strategy to employ, and maximizing athletes'      strength in competitions. Coaches with less coaching experience were also less      confident about motivating athletes.

Most of the 25      interview questions were asked earlier of athletes and now rephrased for coaches.      In general, the coaches were more concerned about the welfare of their athletes      than themselves, directing their energy towards helping their athletes cope with       the boycott and, in some cases, to prepare for alternate competitions. The      coaches' reactions were more subdued than those of the Canadian athletes affected      by the boycott.FAU - Crossman, JaneAU  - Crossman JAD  - School of Kinesiology, Lakehead University, 955 Oliver Road, Thunder Bay,      Ontario, Canada P7B 5E1.FAU - Lappage, RonAU  - Lappage RLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Percept Mot SkillsJT  - Perceptual and motor skillsJID - 0401131SB  - IMMH  - *AttitudeMH  - CanadaMH  - HumansMH  - *International CooperationMH  - MaleMH  - *PerceptionMH  - PoliticsMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - *SportsMH  - *TeachingEDAT- 2002/10/09 04:00MHDA- 2003/02/14 04:00CRDT- 2002/10/09 04:00AID - 10.2466/pms.2002.95.1.68 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Percept Mot Skills. 2002 Aug;95(1):68-70.PMID- 12363299OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20021004DCOM- 20030213LR  - 20041117IS  - 0264-0414 (Print)IS  - 0264-0414 (Linking)VI  - 20IP  - 10DP  - 2002 OctTI  - Temporal pattern analysis and its applicability in sport: an explanation and      exemplar data.PG  - 845-52AB  - Quantitative analysis of sports performance has been shown to produce information      that coaches can use within the coaching process to enhance performance.      Traditional methods for quantifying sport performances are limited in their      capacity to describe the complex interactions of events that occur within a      performance over time. In this paper, we outline a new approach to the analysis      of time-based event records and real-time behaviour records on sport performance       known as T-pattern detection. The relevant elements of the T-pattern detection      process are explained and exemplar data from the analysis of 13 soccer matches      are presented to highlight the potential of this form of analysis. The results      from soccer suggest that it is possible to identify new profiles for both      individuals and teams based on the analysis of temporal behavioural patterns      detected within the performances.FAU - Borrie, AndrewAU  - Borrie AAD  - a.g.borrie@livjm.ac.ukFAU - Jonsson, Gudberg KAU  - Jonsson GKFAU - Magnusson, Magnus SAU  - Magnusson MSLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - EnglandTA  - J Sports SciJT  - Journal of sports sciencesJID - 8405364SB  - IMMH  - AlgorithmsMH  - HumansMH  - Physical Education and Training/*methodsMH  - Psychomotor PerformanceMH  - *SportsMH  - *Task Performance and AnalysisEDAT- 2002/10/05 04:00MHDA- 2003/02/14 04:00CRDT- 2002/10/05 04:00AID - 10.1080/026404102320675675 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Sci. 2002 Oct;20(10):845-52.PMID- 12363297OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20021004DCOM- 20030213LR  - 20131121IS  - 0264-0414 (Print)IS  - 0264-0414 (Linking)VI  - 20IP  - 10DP  - 2002 OctTI  - Technique analysis in sports: a critical review.PG  - 813-28AB  - This paper critically reviews technique analysis as an analytical method used      within sports biomechanics as a part of performance analysis. The concept of      technique as 'a specific sequence of movements' appears to be well established in      the literature, but the concept of technique analysis is less well developed.      Although several descriptive and analytical goals for technique analysis can be      identified, the main justification given for its use is to aid in the improvement      of performance. However, the conceptual framework underpinning this process is      poorly developed with a lack of distinction between technique and performance.      The methods of technique analysis have been divided into qualitative,      quantitative and predictive components. Qualitative technique analysis is      characterized by observation and subjective judgement. Several aids to      observation are identified, including phase analysis, temporal analysis and      critical feature analysis. Although biomechanical principles of movement can be      used to form judgements about technique, little agreement exists about the number      and categories of these principles. A 'deterministic' model can be used to      identify factors that affect performance but, in doing so, technique variables      are frequently overlooked. Quantitative technique analysis relies on      biomechanical data collection methods. The identification of key technique      variables that affect performance is a major issue, but these are poorly      distinguished from other variables that affect performance. Quantitative analysis      is not suitable for establishing the characteristics of the whole skill, but new       methods, such as the use of artificial neural networks, are described that may be      able to overcome this limitation. Other methods based on modelling and computer      simulation also have potential for focusing on the whole skill. Predictive      technique analysis encompasses these developments and offers an attractive      interface between the scientist and coach through visual animation methods. I      conclude that biomechanists need to clarify the underpinning rationale, framework      and scope for the various approaches to technique analysis.FAU - Lees, AdrianAU  - Lees AAD  - Research Institute for Sport and Exercise Sciences, Liverpool John Moores      University, Liverpool, UK. a.lees@livjm.ac.ukLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - EnglandTA  - J Sports SciJT  - Journal of sports sciencesJID - 8405364SB  - IMMH  - Biomechanical PhenomenaMH  - Computer SimulationMH  - HumansMH  - Motor SkillsMH  - MovementMH  - Neural Networks (Computer)MH  - *Psychomotor PerformanceMH  - Sports/*physiologyMH  - *Task Performance and AnalysisRF  - 81EDAT- 2002/10/05 04:00MHDA- 2003/02/14 04:00CRDT- 2002/10/05 04:00AID - 10.1080/026404102320675657 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Sci. 2002 Oct;20(10):813-28.PMID- 12363296OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20021004DCOM- 20030213LR  - 20061115IS  - 0264-0414 (Print)IS  - 0264-0414 (Linking)VI  - 20IP  - 10DP  - 2002 OctTI  - Modelling coaching practice: the role of instruction and demonstration.PG  - 793-811AB  - In this paper, we review the empirical literature pertaining to the effectiveness      of instructions and movement demonstrations. Initially, we examine existing      theories and approaches that try to explain the process of skill acquisition so      as to determine implications of these theories for instructional provision. This       is followed by an evaluation of studies in the motor learning literature in which      pre-practice information has been manipulated. Explicit learning strategies are      contrasted to implicit and discovery learning methods, and current explanations      for instructional effects are discussed in terms of such mechanisms as      effects-related attentional focus and movement variability. In the final      sections, we review data from our own laboratory where pre-practice information      has been manipulated during the learning of a novel bimanual coordination task.      From these studies, proposals are made to try and explain how pre-practice      information works to effect the process of skill acquisition, including the      selection and execution of a response and the processing of associated feedback.       An important role is given to the existing skills of the learner in understanding      the instructions and performing the desired movement. Finally, we suggest some      practical implications of this empirical evidence for the teaching of motor      skills.FAU - Hodges, Nicola JAU  - Hodges NJFAU - Franks, Ian MAU  - Franks IMLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPT  - ReviewPL  - EnglandTA  - J Sports SciJT  - Journal of sports sciencesJID - 8405364SB  - IMMH  - HumansMH  - Knowledge of Results (Psychology)MH  - *Motor SkillsMH  - Physical Education and Training/*methodsMH  - Practice (Psychology)MH  - Psychomotor PerformanceMH  - *Retention (Psychology)MH  - Sports/psychologyMH  - Transfer (Psychology)RF  - 108EDAT- 2002/10/05 04:00MHDA- 2003/02/14 04:00CRDT- 2002/10/05 04:00AID - 10.1080/026404102320675648 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Sci. 2002 Oct;20(10):793-811.PMID- 12363293OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20021004DCOM- 20030213LR  - 20091119IS  - 0264-0414 (Print)IS  - 0264-0414 (Linking)VI  - 20IP  - 10DP  - 2002 OctTI  - Advances in the application of information technology to sport performance.PG  - 755-69AB  - This paper overviews the diverse information technologies that are used to      provide athletes with relevant feedback.

METHODS: In this observational cohort study, 1659 children were observed during 2      seasons of sports participation in an urban area. Data were collected by coaches       using an injury survey tool designed for the study. A reportable injury was      defined as one requiring on-field evaluation by coaching staff, or causing a      player to stop participation for any period of time, or requiring first aid      during an event. Logistic regression analyses were done within and across sports       for injury rates, game versus practice injury frequencies, and gender differences      where appropriate. RESULTS: The injury rates, calculated per 100 athlete      exposures during total events (games plus practices), were: baseball, 1.7;      softball, 1.0; soccer, 2.1; and football, 1.5. The injury rates for baseball and       football were not significantly different. Across sports, contusions were the      most frequent type of injury. Contact with equipment was the most frequent method      of injury, except in football where contact with another player was the most      frequent method. In baseball, 3% of all injuries reported were considered serious      (fracture, dislocation, concussion); in soccer, 1% were considered serious; and      in football, 14% were considered serious. The frequency of injury per team per      season (FITS), an estimation of injury risk, was 3 for baseball and soccer, 2 for      softball, and 14 for football for total events. For all sports, there were more      game than practice injuries; this difference was significant except for softball.      There were no significant gender differences in soccer for injury rates during      total events. CONCLUSIONS: Given the classification of football as a collision      sport, the high number of exposures per player, the FITS score, and the      percentage of injuries considered serious, youth football should be a priority      for injury studies. Health professionals should establish uniform medical      coverage policies for football even at this age level. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR      MODIFICATIONS: Injury surveillance for youth sports is gaining momentum as an      important step toward formulating injury prevention methods. However,      establishing patterns of injuries, taking preventive measures, and evaluating      equipment and coaching modifications may take years. In addition to the objective      findings of this study, our direct observations of community sports through 2      seasons showed areas where immediate modifications could reduce injury risk. The       first recommendation is that youth sports leagues provide and require first aid      training for coaches. Training could be done by sports medicine professionals and      include recognition and immediate response to head, neck, and spine injuries, as       well as heat-related illnesses. The second recommendation is that youth sports      leagues have clear, enforceable return to play guidelines for concussions, neck      and back injuries, fractures, and dislocations. The third recommendation is that       baseball and softball leagues consider the injury prevention potential of face      guards on batting helmets.FAU - Radelet, Marirose AAU  - Radelet MAAD  - Neuromuscular Research Laboratory, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh,      Pennsylvania 15203, USA.FAU - Lephart, Scott MAU  - Lephart SMFAU - Rubinstein, Elaine NAU  - Rubinstein ENFAU - Myers, Joseph BAU  - Myers JBLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - United StatesTA  - PediatricsJT  - PediatricsJID - 0376422SB  - AIMSB  - IMMH  - Athletic Injuries/*epidemiologyMH  - Baseball/injuriesMH  - ChildMH  - FemaleMH  - Football/injuriesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Prospective StudiesMH  - RiskMH  - Sex DistributionMH  - Soccer/injuriesMH  - United States/epidemiologyEDAT- 2002/09/03 10:00MHDA- 2002/10/10 04:00CRDT- 2002/09/03 10:00PST - ppublishSO  - Pediatrics. 2002 Sep;110(3):e28.PMID- 12173963OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20020813DCOM- 20021024LR  - 20041117IS  - 1064-8011 (Print)IS  - 1064-8011 (Linking)VI  - 16IP  - 3DP  - 2002 AugTI  - An analysis of teaching and coaching behaviors of elite strength and conditioning      coaches.PG  - 456-60AB  - The purpose of this study was to analyze the coaching behaviors of 6 elite      strength and conditioning coaches from the southern region of the United States.       The Arizona State University Coaching Observation Instrument, consisting of 16      behavioral categories, was used for the collection of data. Each coach was      observed and filmed on 3 occasions. All observations occurred in the respective      team's weight training facility. The data collected in this study consisted of a       percentage analysis of the observed coaching behaviors. The most frequently      observed behaviors were silent monitoring (21.99%), management (14.62%), and      hustle (11.12%). These results indicate that this population of strength and      conditioning coaches was predominantly engaged in observation of their athletes      (silent monitoring), organization of the weight training activity (management),      and verbal statements to intensify effort (hustle).

This paper discusses definitions of sexual      exploitation, prevalence figures, methods used for entrapping athletes, potential      risk factors, signs of abuse and harassment, and the consequences for survivors.FAU - Bringer, J DAU  - Bringer JDAD  - Cheltenham and Gloucester College of Higher Education, Leisure and Sports      Research Unit, Cheltemham, Gloucester, UK.FAU - Brackenridge, C HAU  - Brackenridge CHFAU - Johnston, L HAU  - Johnston LHLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Curr Womens Health RepJT  - Current women's health reportsJID - 101120027SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - ChildMH  - Child Abuse, Sexual/prevention & control/psychologyMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - LeadershipMH  - MaleMH  - Organizational CultureMH  - Peer GroupMH  - Physical Education and Training/organization & administrationMH  - *PrejudiceMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - *Sexual HarassmentMH  - *SportsMH  - *Women's RightsRF  - 50EDAT- 2002/07/13 10:00MHDA- 2002/08/01 10:01CRDT- 2002/07/13 10:00PST - ppublishSO  - Curr Womens Health Rep. 2001 Dec;1(3):225-31.PMID- 11985767OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20020502DCOM- 20020607LR  - 20071115IS  - 0905-7188 (Print)IS  - 0905-7188 (Linking)VI  - 12IP  - 1DP  - 2002 FebTI  - Elite athletes' experiences of the motivational climate: the coach matters.PG  - 54-9AB  - Recent research investigating the effect of the motivational climate has found      that even elite athletes benefit from a mastery climate. The purpose of the      present study was to obtain a deeper understanding of the importance of the      climate surrounding an athlete and the role of the coach for elite athletes by      conducting in-depth interviews with a group of athletes (n=7). The athletes also       completed the Perception of Success Questionnaire (POSQ) and Perception of      Motivational Climate Questionnaire (PMCQ) to measure motivational indices. All      the athletes were very high on task orientation and moderate to high on ego      orientation. Most of the athletes perceived a high mastery climate and a low      performance climate. The athletes emphasized the importance of the coach as the      creator of the climate, as well as their preference for a supportive and caring      climate. This speaks for an emphasis on a mastery climate for elite athletes.FAU - Pensgaard, Anne MarteAU  - Pensgaard AMAD  - School of Sport and Exercise Sciences, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, B15      2TT, Birmingham, UK.FAU - Roberts, G CAU  - Roberts GCLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - DenmarkTA  - Scand J Med Sci SportsJT  - Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sportsJID - 9111504SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Competitive BehaviorMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - Interviews as TopicMH  - *LeadershipMH  - MaleMH  - *MotivationMH  - NorwayMH  - *Organizational CultureMH  - PersonalityMH  - Physical Education and Training/methodsMH  - Skiing/psychologyMH  - Sports/*psychologyEDAT- 2002/05/03 10:00MHDA- 2002/06/12 10:01CRDT- 2002/05/03 10:00AID - sms120110 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Scand J Med Sci Sports. 2002 Feb;12(1):54-9.PMID- 11974435OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20020426DCOM- 20020529LR  - 20080610IS  - 1661-8157 (Print)IS  - 1661-8157 (Linking)VI  - 91IP  - 12DP  - 2002 Mar 20TI  - [Swiss psychiatry and National mental health.

Consequently, we used a commitment model to address why some coaches maintain      their involvement while others discontinue coaching. For this study, 469 USA      Swimming age-group coaches completed a mail survey designed to assess commitment       model constructs, including coaching satisfaction, benefits, costs, investments,       alternative options, social constraints, and commitment. To test the commitment      model, we first used structural equation modeling to assess whether the model      provided an adequate fit to the data for current and former coaches. Overall,      satisfaction and investments were significantly related to commitment. Moreover,       the standardized path coefficients between benefits and costs and satisfaction      were also significant. Multivariate analysis of variance andfollow-up analyses      revealed that current coaches reported higher commitment as well as less      attractive alternative options, higher investments, and higher social constraints      compared to former coaches. In replication of past research, we compared current       andformer coaches on the benefits and costs associated with coaching.FAU - Raedeke, Thomas DAU  - Raedeke TDAD  - Department of Exercise and Sport Sciences at East Carolina University,      Greenville, NC 27858, USA.

Attitudes of Canadian players and      coaches.PG  - 19-22AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the attitudes of players and coaches to the use of      protective headgear, particularly with respect to the prevention of concussion.      METHODS: A questionnaire designed to assess attitudes to headgear was      administered to 63 players from four different Canadian teams, each representing       a different level of play (high school, university, community club, national). In      addition, coaches from all four levels were questioned about team policies and      their personal opinions about the use of headgear to prevent concussion. RESULTS:      Although the players tended to believe that the headgear could prevent concussion      (62%), the coaches were less convinced (33%). Despite the players' belief that      headgear offers protection against concussion, only a minority reported wearing      headgear (27%) and few (24%) felt that its use should be made mandatory. Common      reasons for not wearing headgear were "its use is not mandatory", "it is      uncomfortable", and "it costs too much". CONCLUSION: Although most players in the      study believe that rugby headgear may prevent concussion, only a minority      reported wearing it. Coaches tended to be less convinced than the players that      rugby headgear can prevent concussion.FAU - Pettersen, J AAU  - Pettersen JAAD  - University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.

It embraces the physical and mental health protection and promotion of      participants in relation to a particular sport activity and sport environment,      directing athletes to a sport and adapting them to sport and the sport to them.      Sports medicine takes part in selection procedure, training process planning and       programming, and cares for epidemiological, hygienic, nutritional and other      problems in sport. The Republic of Croatia belongs to those world states in which      the field of sports medicine is regulated neither by a law or by profession. A      consequence is that wide circle of physicians and paramedics work in clubs and      various medical units without any legal or/and professional control not being      adequately educated nor having licence for it. This review is an appeal to the      Croatian Medical Chamber and the Ministry of Health to make efforts to promote      the education and medical profession in sports medicine.FAU - Heimer, SAU  - Heimer SFAU - Tonkovic-Lojovic, MAU  - Tonkovic-Lojovic MLA  - hrvPT  - EditorialPT  - English AbstractTT  - Medicina u sportu ili sportska medicina?PL  - CroatiaTA  - Lijec VjesnJT  - Lijecnicki vjesnikJID - 0074253SB  - IMCIN - Lijec Vjesn. 2002 May;124(5):170; author reply 170-1.

METHODS: We searched electronic data bases without language restriction,      identified citations from reference sections of research papers retrieved,      contacted experts in the field, and searched the Cochrane Collaboration. Of the      199 citations identified, we emphasized results of the four reports that compared      methods to prevent shin splints. We assessed the methodologic quality of these      reports by using a standardized instrument. RESULTS: The use of shock-absorbent      insoles, foam heel pads, heel cord stretching, alternative footwear, as well as      graduated running programs among military recruits have undergone assessment in      controlled trials. There is no strong support for any of these interventions, and      each of the four controlled trials is limited methodologically. Median quality      scores in these four studies ranged from 29 to 47, and serious flaws in study      design, control of bias, and statistical methods were identified. CONCLUSION: Our      review yielded little objective evidence to support widespread use of any      existing interventions to prevent shin splints. The most encouraging evidence for      effective prevention of shin splints involves the use of shock-absorbing insoles.      However, serious flaws in study design and implementation constrain the work in      this field thus far. A rigorously implemented research program is critically      needed to address this common sports medicine problem.FAU - Thacker, Stephen BAU  - Thacker SBAD  - National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease Control      and Prevention, Atlanta, GA 30333, USA. sbt1@cdc.govFAU - Gilchrist, JulieAU  - Gilchrist JFAU - Stroup, Donna FAU  - Stroup DFFAU - Kimsey, C DexterAU  - Kimsey CDLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Med Sci Sports ExercJT  - Medicine and science in sports and exerciseJID - 8005433SB  - IMSB  - SMH  - Athletic Injuries/*prevention & controlMH  - Cumulative Trauma Disorders/*prevention & controlMH  - Evaluation Studies as TopicMH  - FemaleMH  - Fractures, Stress/*prevention & controlMH  - HumansMH  - Leg Injuries/*prevention & controlMH  - MaleMH  - Physical Education and Training/methodsMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Sex FactorsMH  - ShoesMH  - Sports EquipmentMH  - Tibial Fractures/prevention & controlRF  - 161EDAT- 2002/01/10 10:00MHDA- 2002/02/20 10:01CRDT- 2002/01/10 10:00PST - ppublishSO  - Med Sci Sports Exerc. 2002 Jan;34(1):32-40.PMID- 11740290OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20011212DCOM- 20020117LR  - 20041117IS  - 0195-9131 (Print)IS  - 0195-9131 (Linking)VI  - 33IP  - 12DP  - 2001 DecTI  - An operational model to investigate contact sports injuries.PG  - 1999-2003AB  - PURPOSE: A cyclical operational model is proposed to examine the      interrelationship of a number of factors that are involved in sports injury      epidemiology. In sports injury research, investigations often attempt to identify      a unique risk factor that distinguishes an injured player. However, a wide      variety of factors can contribute to a sports injury occurring, and an      understanding of the cause of injury is important to advance knowledge. METHODS:       The proposed model identifies a healthy/fit player initially, although the player      may exhibit a number of intrinsic risk factors for sports injury. Before exposure      to extrinsic risk factors, there is the opportunity for implementation of      prevention strategies by coaching personnel and the sports medicine team. These      strategies might include, among others, appropriate warm-up, adequate hydration,       wearing protective equipment, and prophylactic taping. Additionally, preventative      screening could take place to assess the various intrinsic and extrinsic risk      factors that could lead to sports injury. DISCUSSION: Two examples of how the      operational model relates to contact sports injury cases are presented.      Participating in sport inevitably exposes the player to external risk factors      that predispose toward injury. The treatment of the injured player aims to      restore the player to preinjury playing status and to prevent the injury from      becoming chronic. CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that the application of this      proposed cyclical model may lead to greater success in understanding the      multifaceted nature of sports injuries and furthermore help minimize injury risk       and support the rehabilitation of injured contact sports participants.FAU - Gissane, CAU  - Gissane CAD  - Department of Health Studies, Brunel University, Osterley Campus, Isleworth,      Middlesex, TW5 7DU, England, UK. conor.gissane@brunel.ac.ukFAU - White, JAU  - White JFAU - Kerr, KAU  - Kerr KFAU - Jennings, DAU  - Jennings DLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Med Sci Sports ExercJT  - Medicine and science in sports and exerciseJID - 8005433SB  - IMSB  - SMH  - Athletic Injuries/*epidemiology/prevention & controlMH  - CausalityMH  - HumansMH  - IncidenceMH  - *Models, TheoreticalMH  - PrevalenceMH  - RecurrenceMH  - Risk Assessment/methodsMH  - Wounds, Nonpenetrating/*epidemiology/prevention & controlEDAT- 2001/12/12 10:00MHDA- 2002/01/18 10:01CRDT- 2001/12/12 10:00PST - ppublishSO  - Med Sci Sports Exerc. 2001 Dec;33(12):1999-2003.PMID- 11708400OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20011115DCOM- 20020315LR  - 20081121IS  - 0112-1642 (Print)IS  - 0112-1642 (Linking)VI  - 31IP  - 13DP  - 2001TI  - Potential applications of heat and cold stress indices to sporting events.PG  - 909-17AB  - Many recreational and elite athletes participate in sporting events every year.      However, when these events are conducted under hostile environmental conditions,       whether in cold or hot climates, the risk for environmental illnesses increases.       The higher the stress, the greater is the potential for performance decrements,      injuries and illnesses. The most common expected heat illnesses are heat      exhaustion and heatstroke, whereas hypothermia and frostbite are the most common       cold injuries. However, heat and cold stress indices can minimise the risk for      environmental illnesses and dehydration by following the recommendations and      guidelines which accompany these indices. Stress indices should be used by      athletes, coaches and officials to prevent injury and improve safety conditions      for competitors and participants in recreational activities. All participants      should be made aware of warning signs, susceptibility and predisposing      conditions. Coaches should be aware of their responsibility with regard to the      safety of their trainees, and officials should organise and plan events at times       that are likely to be of low environmental stress. However, they must also be      prepared and equipped with the means necessary to reduce injuries and treat cases      of collapse and environmental illnesses. The lack of a friendly, small and simple      device for environmental stress assessment is probably the main reason why stress      indices are not commonly used. We believe that developing a new portable heat and      cold stress monitor in wristwatch format for use by those exposed to      environmental stress could help in the decision making process of expected      hazards caused by exercising and working in hostile environments, and might help       prevent heat and cold illnesses.FAU - Moran, D SAU  - Moran DSAD  - Heller Institute of Medical Research, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Sackler      Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - New ZealandTA  - Sports MedJT  - Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)JID - 8412297SB  - IMMH  - *Cold Temperature/adverse effectsMH  - DehydrationMH  - Heat Stroke/prevention & controlMH  - *Hot Temperature/adverse effectsMH  - HumansMH  - Hypothermia/prevention & controlMH  - *SportsRF  - 73EDAT- 2001/11/16 10:00MHDA- 2002/03/16 10:01CRDT- 2001/11/16 10:00PST - ppublishSO  - Sports Med. 2001;31(13):909-17.PMID- 11665914OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20011022DCOM- 20020205LR  - 20051116IS  - 0112-1642 (Print)IS  - 0112-1642 (Linking)VI  - 31IP  - 12DP  - 2001TI  - Psychological factors in sport performance: the Mental Health Model revisited.PG  - 875-90AB  - The Mental Health Model (MHM) of sport performance purports that an inverse      relationship exists between psychopathology and sport performance. The model      postulates that as an athlete's mental health either worsens or improves      performance should fall or rise accordingly, and there is now considerable      support for this view. Studies have shown that between 70 and 85% of successful      and unsuccessful athletes can be identified using general psychological measures       of personality structure and mood state, a level superior to chance but      insufficient for the purpose of selecting athletes. Longitudinal MHM research      indicates that the mood state responses of athletes exhibit a dose-response      relationship with their training load, a finding that has shown potential for      reducing the incidence of the staleness syndrome in athletes who undergo      intensive physical training. The MHM also has implications for the general care      of athletes as support services have traditionally been limited to preventing or       treating physical problems. Despite its simple premise and empirical support, the      MHM has often been mischaracterised in the sport psychology literature and      recently some authors have questioned its validity.

Concussion may be defined      as an acute trauma-induced alteration of mental function lasting fewer than 24      hours, with or without preceding loss of consciousness. The physician's      responsibilities in assessing an athlete with concussion include determining the       need for emergency intervention and offering guidance about the athlete's ability      to return to play. Concussion may be complicated by cerebral edema related to the      second impact syndrome, cumulative neuropsychologic deficits, intracranial      bleeding or the postconcussion syndrome. The risk of complications is increased      in athletes who prematurely return to play and in those with prolonged loss of      consciousness or post-traumatic amnesia. An athlete with prolonged loss of      consciousness or signs and symptoms that worsen or persist after a concussion      should be evaluated in the emergency department. An athlete should not be allowed      to resume sports participation until all symptoms of a concussion have resolved.FAU - Kushner, D SAU  - Kushner DSAD  - Department of Neurology, University of Miami School of Medicine, Florida 33101,      USA.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Am Fam PhysicianJT  - American family physicianJID - 1272646SB  - AIMSB  - IMCIN - Am Fam Physician. 2001 Sep 15;64(6):938, 940.

DESIGN: Retrospective      cohort study of injury reports compiled by certified athletic trainers between      Fall 1980 and Spring 1995. SETTING: An NCAA division III College. PARTICIPANTS:      Eighteen to 22 year-old male and female college athletes competing in seven like       sports (basketball, cross-country running, soccer, swimming, tennis, track and      water polo) at the intercollegiate level, playing similar number of contests and       using the same facilities. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Analyses of injury patterns,      classified by sport and anatomic location, for men and women in seven like      sports. RESULTS: A total of 3,767 participants were included in the study, with      1874 sports-related injuries reported among the men and women's teams. Of these      injuries, 856 (45.7%) were sustained by female and 1018 (54.3%) by male athletes.      Overall, no statistically significant gender difference was found for injuries      per 100 participant-years (52.5 for female athlete versus 47.7 for males). A      statistically significant gender difference in injury incidence (p < 0.001) was      seen for two sports: swimming and water polo. Female swimmers reported more      back/neck, shoulder, hip, knee and foot injuries: and female water polo players      reported more shoulder injuries. When evaluating all sports concurrently, female       athletes reported a higher rate of hip, lower-leg and shoulder injuries, while      male athletes reported a higher rate of thigh injuries. CONCLUSION: Except for      some minor gender differences in total injuries for two sports and several      differences in total injuries by anatomic location, our data suggest very little       difference in the pattern of injury between men and women competing in comparable      sports. The increased rate of shoulder injury among female swimmers probably      resulted from the more rigorous training philosophy of their coach. Thus, no      gender-specific recommendations can be suggested for decreasing the incidence of       injury to female athletes competing in these sports.FAU - Sallis, R EAU  - Sallis READ  - Department of Family Medicine, Kaiser Permanente Medical Center, Fontana,      Californa, USA. robert.e.sallis@kp.orgFAU - Jones, KAU  - Jones KFAU - Sunshine, SAU  - Sunshine SFAU - Smith, GAU  - Smith GFAU - Simon, LAU  - Simon LLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - GermanyTA  - Int J Sports MedJT  - International journal of sports medicineJID - 8008349SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - Athletic Injuries/*epidemiologyMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - IncidenceMH  - MaleMH  - Sex DistributionMH  - Sex FactorsMH  - United States/epidemiologyMH  - UniversitiesEDAT- 2001/09/04 10:00MHDA- 2002/01/10 10:01CRDT- 2001/09/04 10:00AID - 10.1055/s-2001-16246 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Int J Sports Med. 2001 Aug;22(6):420-3.PMID- 11495322OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20010809DCOM- 20011227LR  - 20051116IS  - 1050-642X (Print)IS  - 1050-642X (Linking)VI  - 11IP  - 3DP  - 2001 JulTI  - Standardized mental status assessment of sports concussion.PG  - 176-81AB  - Neurocognitive status is often considered the domain of neurologic functioning      most sensitive to change following concussion, but the effects are often subtle      and difficult to detect on routine clinical examination. Recent efforts have      focused on the development of brief, standardized methods of mental status      assessment for use by sports medicine clinicians to quantify the acute      neurocognitive effects of concussion and objectively track postinjury recovery.      Research has demonstrated the reliability, validity, and sensitivity of these      measures in detecting concussion in athletes and providing empirical data for      consideration in the context of other examination findings, neuropsychologic test      data, and neuroimaging results. Standardized measures of mental status and other       postconcussive symptoms are valuable tools to assist clinicians in the assessment      and management of concussion, but should not be used as a replacement for medical      evaluation or viewed as a stand-alone means for determining readiness to return      to competition after injury.FAU - McCrea, MAU  - McCrea MAD  - Neuropsychology Service, Waukesha Memorial Hospital, Wisconsin 53188, USA.      michael.mccrea@phci.orgLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - United StatesTA  - Clin J Sport MedJT  - Clinical journal of sport medicine : official journal of the Canadian Academy of       Sport MedicineJID - 9103300SB  - IMMH  - Athletic Injuries/*diagnosisMH  - Brain Concussion/*diagnosisMH  - HumansMH  - Mental Status ScheduleMH  - *Neuropsychological Tests/standardsRF  - 46EDAT- 2001/08/10 10:00MHDA- 2002/01/05 10:01CRDT- 2001/08/10 10:00PST - ppublishSO  - Clin J Sport Med. 2001 Jul;11(3):176-81.PMID- 11495317OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20010809DCOM- 20011227LR  - 20041117IS  - 1050-642X (Print)IS  - 1050-642X (Linking)VI  - 11IP  - 3DP  - 2001 JulTI  - The assessment of sport-related concussion: the evidence behind      neuropsychological testing and management.PG  - 134-43AB  - Because of the lack of valid evidence to support the current recommendations for       the management of mild traumatic brain injury (concussion), many physicians,      athletic trainers, coaches, and athletes have called into question the way      concussions are treated in athletics. This review article discusses the current      evidence for the management of concussion in high school, college, and      professional sports. A complete review of the epidemiologic and      neuropsychological studies to date is presented and critically reviewed, as are      other assessment and management tools in concussion. The appropriate use of      neuropsychological testing, grading scales, and return-to-play recommendations      are discussed in depth based on the current evidence.

A 3 x 6 repeated-measures analysis of variance indicated that no      differences were significant in attribution of the causes of home advantage for      the combinations of sex of coach and sex of athlete. A significant difference was      noted in the percentages assigned across the five explanations provided the      coaches. Post hoc comparison indicated that site familiarity was seen as the most      important explanation across the combinations of the sex of coach and sex of      athlete.FAU - Gayton, W FAU  - Gayton WFAD  - Department of Psychology, University of Southern Maine, Portland 04104, USA.FAU - Broida, JAU  - Broida JFAU - Elgee, LAU  - Elgee LLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Percept Mot SkillsJT  - Perceptual and motor skillsJID - 0401131SB  - IMMH  - *AttitudeMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Sex FactorsMH  - *SportsMH  - *TeachingEDAT- 2001/07/17 10:00MHDA- 2002/01/05 10:01CRDT- 2001/07/17 10:00AID - 10.2466/pms.2001.92.3.933 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Percept Mot Skills. 2001 Jun;92(3 Pt 1):933-6.PMID- 11440329OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20010706DCOM- 20010726LR  - 20131121IS  - 0038-4348 (Print)IS  - 0038-4348 (Linking)VI  - 94IP  - 6DP  - 2001 JunTI  - Use of oral creatine as an ergogenic aid for increased sports performance:      perceptions of adolescent athletes.PG  - 608-12AB  - BACKGROUND: Competitive athletes, including adolescents, seek ways to gain      advantage over competitors. One ergogenic aid is creatine, a naturally occurring       nitrogen compound found primarily in skeletal muscle. Increasing creatine levels       may prolong skeletal muscle activity, enhancing work output. METHODS: A      questionnaire assessing awareness and use of creatine supplementation was      completed by 674 athletes from 11 high schools. Data were statistically analyzed       to determine variation among groups. RESULTS: Of those surveyed, 75% had      knowledge of creatine supplements, and 16% used creatine to enhance athletic      performance. Percentage of use increased with age and grade level. Awareness and       use were greater among boys than girls. Adverse effects were reported by 26%.      Most athletes consumed creatine using a method inconsistent with scientific      recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Use of creatine by adolescent athletes is      significant and inconsistent with optimal dosing. Physicians, athletic trainers,       and coaches should disseminate proper information and advise these adolescent      athletes.FAU - Ray, T RAU  - Ray TRAD  - Center for Sports Medicine and Orthopaedics Foundation for Research, Chattanooga,      Tenn, USA.FAU - Eck, J CAU  - Eck JCFAU - Covington, L AAU  - Covington LAFAU - Murphy, R BAU  - Murphy RBFAU - Williams, RAU  - Williams RFAU - Knudtson, JAU  - Knudtson JLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - South Med JJT  - Southern medical journalJID - 0404522RN  - MU72812GK0 (Creatine)SB  - AIMSB  - IMMH  - Administration, OralMH  - AdolescentMH  - *Adolescent BehaviorMH  - AdultMH  - Creatine/*administration & dosage/adverse effectsMH  - *Doping in SportsMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Physical EnduranceMH  - QuestionnairesEDAT- 2001/07/07 10:00MHDA- 2001/07/28 10:01CRDT- 2001/07/07 10:00PST - ppublishSO  - South Med J. 2001 Jun;94(6):608-12.PMID- 11431137OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20010629DCOM- 20010816LR  - 20051116IS  - 0022-0795 (Print)IS  - 0022-0795 (Linking)VI  - 170IP  - 1DP  - 2001 JulTI  - Drugs in sport - the role of the physician.PG  - 55-61AB  - Sportsmen have used anabolic steroids since the 1950s and yet it was not until      the 1980s that we, as physicians, admitted that they could improve performance.      We now find ourselves in the insidious position of being unable to predict      convincingly either safety or major health risks with performance-enhancing drug       use. The use of performance-enhancing drugs is no longer limited to the elite      athlete. In 1993 the Canadian Center for Drug-free Sport estimated that 83 000      children between the ages of 11 and 18 had used anabolic steroids in the previous      12 months. Recent evidence suggests anabolic steroids are now the third most      commonly offered drugs to children in the UK, behind cannabis and amphetamines.      The role of the physician of today is to regain our position of impartiality and       objectivity within both the sporting and general community. Only then will we be       able to pursue a harm minimisation strategy designed to convince the public that       it is better to be the best you can be naturally. For the majority, the      improvement through the use of performance-enhancing drugs can equally be      achieved through dietary and training advice. For the elite athlete, what price a      gold medal that is tarnished by deceit? Its value then can only lie with the      sponsors and politicians, for they can no longer claim to be sportsmen, only      entertainers.FAU - Dawson, R TAU  - Dawson RTAD  - Drugs In Sport Clinic and User's Support (DISCUS), Adderstone House, Dene Road,      Rowlands Gill, Tyne & Wear, NE39 1DU, UK.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - EnglandTA  - J EndocrinolJT  - The Journal of endocrinologyJID - 0375363RN  - 0 (Anabolic Agents)RN  - 0 (Gonadal Steroid Hormones)SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - Anabolic Agents/adverse effectsMH  - ChildMH  - *Doping in SportsMH  - FemaleMH  - *Gonadal Steroid Hormones/adverse effectsMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Physical Education and TrainingMH  - *Physician's RoleMH  - Sports/psychologyMH  - *Substance Abuse DetectionRF  - 45EDAT- 2001/06/30 10:00MHDA- 2001/08/17 10:01CRDT- 2001/06/30 10:00AID - JOE04100 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - J Endocrinol. 2001 Jul;170(1):55-61.PMID- 11403121OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20010613DCOM- 20011101LR  - 20061115IS  - 1050-642X (Print)IS  - 1050-642X (Linking)VI  - 11IP  - 2DP  - 2001 AprTI  - Gender influences on career opportunities, practice choices, and job satisfaction      in a cohort of physicians with certification in sports medicine.PG  - 96-102AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the gender differences in practice patterns, experiences,      and career opportunities for family physicians who practice sports medicine.      DESIGN: Descriptive, self-administered questionnaire. PARTICIPANTS: Family      physicians with Certificate of Added Qualification (CAQ) in sports medicine were       surveyed. The survey was sent to all women with a CAQ in Sports Medicine and a      random sample of 20% of the men with CAQs in sports medicine. MAIN OUTCOME      MEASURE: Survey consisted of multiple choice, Likert scale, and opened-ended      questions. The data was analyzed with contingency tables, with gender as the      dependent variable. RESULTS: Response rate to the survey was 75%, which included       42 females and 102 males. Demographics of our population demonstrated some gender      differences. Males were of higher average age (41.1 vs. 38.1), and more likely to      be married and have children. Practice types, location, and time spent in sports       medicine did not differ with the exception of training room and event coverage.      Males were more likely to cover all levels of training room except at the      Division I level, where the percent of males and females covering training rooms       were equal. Males were also more likely to cover all types of sporting events.      Job satisfaction and reasons for choosing current jobs did not show significant      gender differences. However, factors affecting career opportunities did vary.      Professional relationships with athletic trainers and coaches were perceived to      be different by males and females surveyed. CONCLUSIONS: Our survey of sports      medicine physicians showed some gender differences in practice patterns relative       to training room and sporting event coverage. Surprisingly, there were not many      differences in the factors that affected job choice and factors affecting job      opportunities with the exception of gender itself. However, our study does not      conclude how or when gender begins to affect the female sports medicine      physician's career opportunities.FAU - Pana, A LAU  - Pana ALAD  - Department of Family Medicine, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia,      Pennsylvania 19107-5099, USA.FAU - McShane, JAU  - McShane JLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Clin J Sport MedJT  - Clinical journal of sport medicine : official journal of the Canadian Academy of       Sport MedicineJID - 9103300SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - *Career ChoiceMH  - Data CollectionMH  - Educational StatusMH  - FemaleMH  - *Gender IdentityMH  - HumansMH  - Interprofessional RelationsMH  - *Job SatisfactionMH  - MaleMH  - Marriage/statistics & numerical dataMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Physicians, Family/*statistics & numerical dataMH  - Physicians, Women/*statistics & numerical dataMH  - Professional Practice Location/statistics & numerical dataMH  - Sex FactorsMH  - Socioeconomic FactorsMH  - Sports Medicine/*statistics & numerical dataMH  - United StatesEDAT- 2001/06/14 10:00MHDA- 2001/11/03 10:01CRDT- 2001/06/14 10:00PST - ppublishSO  - Clin J Sport Med. 2001 Apr;11(2):96-102.PMID- 11402251OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20010612DCOM- 20010726LR  - 20081121IS  - 1526-484X (Print)IS  - 1526-484X (Linking)VI  - 11IP  - 2DP  - 2001 JunTI  - Nutrition knowledge, opinions, and practices of coaches and athletic trainers at       a division 1 university.PG  - 174-85AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to assess nutrition knowledge, opinions,      and practices of coaches and trainers at a Division I university. Participants (n      = 53) completed questionnaires regarding nutrition knowledge, opinions, and      practices. Descriptive statistics and analysis of variance were used to analyze      data. Overall, participants responded correctly to 67% of nutrition knowledge      questions. Participants who coached/trained female athletes tended to score      better than respondents who coached/trained male athletes. Strength and      conditioning coaches and participants with greater than 15 years of experience      scored higher than other participants. Nutrition opinions/practices responses      revealed that nutritional supplements were provided for all but 6% of      participants' athletes. Participants rated body weight as more important than      body composition to athletes' performances. Over 30% of participants perceived at      least one case of disordered eating within the past year. Some participants (53%)      felt that athletes may consume more nutritious meals on team-sponsored trips if      given larger food allowances. Thirty percent of participants reported dietitians       were available to them; the same percentage reported utilizing dietitians.      Coaches and trainers are knowledgeable about some appropriate nutritional      recommendations, but registered dietitians or qualified sports nutrition      professionals may complement the nutrition-related education and counseling of      athletes (23).FAU - Smith-Rockwell, MAU  - Smith-Rockwell MAD  - University of Athletic Association, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611,      USA.FAU - Nickols-Richardson, S MAU  - Nickols-Richardson SMFAU - Thye, F WAU  - Thye FWLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Int J Sport Nutr Exerc MetabJT  - International journal of sport nutrition and exercise metabolismJID - 100939812SB  - IMMH  - Body CompositionMH  - Body WeightMH  - Data CollectionMH  - Dietary SupplementsMH  - *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, PracticeMH  - HumansMH  - *Nutritional Physiological PhenomenaMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - *SportsMH  - Sports MedicineMH  - TeachingMH  - UniversitiesEDAT- 2001/06/13 10:00MHDA- 2001/07/28 10:01CRDT- 2001/06/13 10:00PST - ppublishSO  - Int J Sport Nutr Exerc Metab. 2001 Jun;11(2):174-85.PMID- 11354611OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20010516DCOM- 20010920LR  - 20061115IS  - 0264-0414 (Print)IS  - 0264-0414 (Linking)VI  - 19IP  - 5DP  - 2001 MayTI  - A test of processing efficiency theory in a team sport context.PG  - 321-32AB  - In this study, we tested some key postulates of Eysenck and Calvo's processing      efficiency theory in a team sport. The participants were 12 elite male volleyball      players who were followed throughout the course of a competitive season.      Self-report measures of pre-match and in-game cognitive anxiety and mental effort      were collected in groups of players high and low in dispositional anxiety. Player      performance was determined from the statistical analysis of match-play. Sets were      classified according to the point spread separating the two teams into one of      three levels of criticality. Game momentum was also analysed to determine its      influence on in-game state anxiety. Significant differences in in-game cognitive       anxiety were apparent between high and low trait anxiety groups. An interaction      between anxiety grouping and momentum condition was also evident in cognitive      anxiety. Differences in set criticality were reflected in significant elevations       in mental effort, an effect more pronounced in dispositionally high anxious      performers. Consistent with the predictions of processing efficiency theory,      mental effort ratings were higher in high trait-anxious players in settings where      their performance was equivalent to that of low trait-anxious performers.

Effects of sports on mental health].PG  - 202-5AB  - The role of mental health is increasingly recognised in the discussion about      health. In this article, health is considered to be a dynamic balance between      resources and potential risk factors. Sport and physical activity may represent      resources that do not only contribute to an increased well-being, but also to an       improved self concept as a cognitive representation of one's health-status.      Investigations of the short-time effects of sport show that different activities       result in different mood changes, but also that the initial mood is important in       such a way that people with a bad mood profit more from physical activity      programmes. More permanent physical activity results in better well-being, but      also in an improved perception of the health status and a higher satisfaction      with health. Individually tailored new physical activity behaviour programmes and      reinforcing systems have to be developed. These may lead to adequately strengthen      the self-efficacy and increase the well-being of a broader population.FAU - Seiler, RAU  - Seiler RAD  - Sportpsychologie und Sozialwissenschaften, Sportwissenschaftliches Institut,      Bundesamt fur Sport, Magglingen. roland.seiler@baspo.admin.chFAU - Birrer, DAU  - Birrer DLA  - gerPT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewTT  - Treibe Sport und fuhl' dich wohl!

A fictitious selection report of a      female field hockey player was presented to subjects with coach, sport      psychologist and psychotherapist as the three professionals. It was hypothesised       that subjects' recommendations regarding selection would differ depending on the       consultant used. No differences were found which suggests the absence of a      negative halo effect and that derogation would not occur within this sample      group. Definitions and perceived role of the sport psychologist varied with the      subjective tone of the responses from participants being mainly positive (74%).      These results indicate that this female student athlete sample has a moderated,      even a positive, perception of the sport psychologist.

Swimming, tennis, and      volleyball coaches from Division I and Division III schools rank ordered 15      attributes that contribute to successful athletic achievement. They also rated      the relevance, effort, and pleasure of 7 athletic and 7 everyday events for      improving athletic achievement. The rank orders showed that the coaches primarily      attributed athletic achievement to innate talent, intrinsic motivation, and      effort while factors such as accumulated practice and type of the practice      received lower rankings. Findings for practice effort were consistent with      deliberate practice theory while the relevance and pleasure findings were mixed.

The aim of this study was to document certain attitudes of       professional coaches faced with doping, and to evaluate how they confronted it on      an everyday basis. METHODS: EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: prospective study by      self-reporting questionnaire. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: the questionnaire was      mailed to the last 800 graduated coaches (1994-1997) in the Lorraine region,      Eastern France. The 260 responding coaches comprised 77 women and 183 men, the      average age being 30.8 +/- 8.0 years (mean +/- standard deviation). RESULTS:      10.3% of coaches consider that an athlete may use doping with no health hazard      with the help of a physician, and 30.0% that an athlete who declines doping has      little chance of succeeding. 5.8% had used doping drugs in the last twelve months      (1 to 6 times). 13.5% of coaches mention that athletes (1 to 5 per coach on      average) told them they had been prompted to use doping drugs during the previous      12 months. 80.7% consider that the current methods of preventing doping in sport       are ineffective, and 98.1% of them consider that they have a role to play within       this context, but 80.3% consider themselves badly trained in the prevention of      doping. Only 10.4% have organized a doping prevention action during the last 12      months. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, professional coaches do not seem to be      efficient in the prevention of doping. Further education and training for coaches      on doping is advisable.FAU - Laure, PAU  - Laure PAD  - Faculte de Medecine, Laboratoire de Physiologie, Vandoeuvre, France.      patrick.laure@wanadoo.frFAU - Thouvenin, FAU  - Thouvenin FFAU - Lecerf, TAU  - Lecerf TLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - ItalyTA  - J Sports Med Phys FitnessJT  - The Journal of sports medicine and physical fitnessJID - 0376337SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Analysis of VarianceMH  - *AttitudeMH  - Chi-Square DistributionMH  - Doping in Sports/*psychologyMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Prospective StudiesMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Sports/physiology/*psychologyEDAT- 2001/04/24 10:00MHDA- 2001/07/28 10:01CRDT- 2001/04/24 10:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Med Phys Fitness. 2001 Mar;41(1):132-6.PMID- 11302464OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20010413DCOM- 20010816LR  - 20111117IS  - 0342-5282 (Print)IS  - 0342-5282 (Linking)VI  - 24IP  - 1DP  - 2001 MarTI  - Effects of alternated sport competition in perceived competence for adolescent      males with mild to moderate mental retardation.PG  - 51-8AB  - Since the beginning of the 1990s, two types of organized competitive sport      (Segregated or Integrated) have been proposed for adolescents with mental      retardation (AMR). These programmes often have as an objective the improvement of      the individual's perceived competence. In France, a third competitive system,      called Alternated sport meets (Segregated and Integrated) is actually used. The      purpose of this study is to examine the effects of this type of programme and      type of sport (basketball versus running) on domains of perceived competence and       general self-worth. The participants were 32 AMR (Mean age 13.5 years, SD = 0.80)      divided equally into four groups: (a) alternated basketball; (b) alternated      running; (c) control, adapted physical activity; (d) control, sedentary. The      experimental treatment was for 7 months. The sport groups participated in 2 hours      training each week and six competitive meets. We administrated Harter's (1985)      Self-Perception Profile for Children seven times to determine changes in      perceived competence and general self-worth.

The      focus on addictions among athletes has gained considerable attention among sports      medicine clinicians. Diagnostic indicators, risk and protective factors, and a      stage model of addiction among athletes are addressed.

Over the years,      the design and build of racing cars has improved so that morbidity and mortality       in motor sport has been lessened. Those team members supporting the competitors      need to be physically and mentally fit to perform complicated tasks, despite      having traveled. This group of travelers has not been studied to any extent      previously. METHOD: An anonymous questionnaire asking some basic travel medicine       related questions was distributed to the support team members of a Rally team,      and Formula One Grand Prix team. Both teams were based in the UK, and competed in      all the rounds of their respective world championships. RESULTS: Ten Rally team      members and 18 Formula One team members responded to the questionnaire. The      results showed moderate coverage of commonly used vaccinations; appropriate use      of antimalarials and insect repellents, but by no means by all team members;      little or no problems with traveler's diarrhea; some tendencies to problems      related to jet lag, but no real attempt to prevent the problem; and finally some       attempt at skin protection against solar damage. CONCLUSION: Support teams are      reasonably well prepared for the combination of, the rigors of frequent travel,      and a demanding job. There is a deficit in vaccine coverage, especially of both      hepatitis A and B, some education is needed in preventing skin problems later in       life due to sun exposure, and further study of jet lag and its implications might      be appropriate.FAU - Walters, AAU  - Walters AAD  - General Practitioner, Mayford House Surgery, East Road, Northallerton, DL6 1NP,      United Kingdom.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - CanadaTA  - J Travel MedJT  - Journal of travel medicineJID - 9434456RN  - 0 (Sunscreening Agents)SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - FemaleMH  - Great BritainMH  - *Health BehaviorMH  - *Health PromotionMH  - HumansMH  - Immunization/statistics & numerical dataMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - *Motor VehiclesMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - *SportsMH  - Sunscreening Agents/administration & dosageMH  - *TravelEDAT- 2001/03/07 10:00MHDA- 2001/05/22 10:01CRDT- 2001/03/07 10:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Travel Med. 2000 Sep-Oct;7(5):267-74.PMID- 11188388OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20010116DCOM- 20010315LR  - 20080716IS  - 0029-2001 (Print)IS  - 0029-2001 (Linking)VI  - 120IP  - 29DP  - 2000 Nov 30TI  - [Can sports and physical activity promote young peoples' psychosocial health?].PG  - 3573-7AB  - BACKGROUND: Sport and physical activity is generally believed to be beneficial to      young people's psychosocial health, but the scientific evidence seems equivocal.       This article gives a narrative review of recent developments in the literature on      psychosocial health effects of physical activity and sport among children and      adolescents. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Based on a narrative review of a selection of       metaanalytical and key studies, results in four areas of psychosocial functioning      are presented. RESULTS: Findings support an association between involvement in      physical activity and sport and well-being. Physical activity is associated with       lower levels of mental health problems, and seems to promote self-esteem.      Physical activity as a treatment of mental health problems for this age group is       underexplored and no firm conclusions can be made. The evidence with respect to      effects on cognitive and academic functioning is weak. Further, the evidence that      juvenile delinquency and antisocial development could be counteracted is      equivocal. INTERPRETATION: There is a paucity of studies that can confirm any      causal effects. Future research would benefit particularly from studying the role      of sports and physical activity mode as well as the psychological and social      context in which it may produce beneficial psychosocial outcomes.FAU - Ommundsen, YAU  - Ommundsen YAD  - Norges idrettshogskole Postboks 4014 Ulleval Stadion 0806 Oslo.

There is      evidence that the ratio of the length of the 2nd and 4th digits (2D:4D) is a      negative correlate of prenatal and adult testosterone. We use ability in sports,       and particularly ability in football, as a proxy for male physical      competitiveness. Compared to males with high 2D:4D ratio, men with low ratio      reported higher attainment in a range of sports and had higher mental rotation      scores (a measure of visual-spatial ability). Professional football players had      lower 2D:4D ratios than controls. Football players in 1st team squads had lower      2D:4D than reserves or youth team players. Men who had represented their country       had lower ratios than those who had not, and there was a significant (one-tailed)      negative association between 2D:4D and number of international appearances after       the effect of country was removed. We suggest that prenatal and adult      testosterone promotes the development and maintenance of traits which are useful       in sports and athletics disciplines and in male:male fighting.FAU - Manning, J T.AU  - Manning JTAD  - Population and Evolutionary Biology Research Unit, School of Biological Sciences,      University of Liverpool, L69 3BX, Liverpool, UKFAU - Taylor, R P.AU  - Taylor RPLA  - ENGPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLETA  - Evol Hum BehavJT  - Evolution and human behavior : official journal of the Human Behavior and      Evolution SocietyJID - 9709475EDAT- 2001/02/22 11:00MHDA- 2001/02/22 11:00CRDT- 2001/02/22 11:00AID - S1090513800000635 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Evol Hum Behav. 2001 Jan;22(1):61-69.PMID- 11105439OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20010104DCOM- 20010104LR  - 20091026IS  - 0332-3102 (Print)IS  - 0332-3102 (Linking)VI  - 93IP  - 6DP  - 2000 SepTI  - A study of the knowledge that school rugby coaches have in the management and      prevention of serious neck injury.PG  - 171-4AB  - The following study is an analysis of the knowledge school rugby coaches      responsible for Senior Cup Team in Leinster, have in the area of neck injury      prevention and management. When serious neck injuries affect schoolboys it is      particularly tragic and deserves special attention. The study targeted all the      coaches of Senior Cup Teams in Leinster. Results showed that coaches lack vital      knowledge in the area of neck injury prevention, recognition and management. Only      50% (n = 18) of coaches have a first aid qualification and only 47% (n = 17)      carry first aid equipment to deal with neck injuries to matches.

The study highlights the need to provide better first aid facilities in       schools and demonstrates the need for further education of school rugby coaches.FAU - Cooney, MAU  - Cooney MAD  - School of Physiotherapy, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Dublin,      Trinity College. mcooney@tcd.ieFAU - Coleman, FAU  - Coleman FFAU - Flynn, AAU  - Flynn ALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - IRELANDTA  - Ir Med JJT  - Irish medical journalJID - 0430275SB  - IMMH  - Cervical Vertebrae/injuriesMH  - Educational StatusMH  - First AidMH  - Football/*injuriesMH  - *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, PracticeMH  - HumansMH  - IrelandMH  - MaleMH  - Neck Injuries/*prevention & controlMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - School Health Services/standardsMH  - Sports Medicine/manpowerEDAT- 2000/12/06 11:00MHDA- 2001/02/28 10:01CRDT- 2000/12/06 11:00PST - ppublishSO  - Ir Med J. 2000 Sep;93(6):171-4.PMID- 11104303OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20010315DCOM- 20010531LR  - 20061115IS  - 1440-2440 (Print)VI  - 3IP  - 2DP  - 2000 JunTI  - The relationship between coaching behaviours and sport anxiety in athletes.PG  - 110-9AB  - Previous research has identified the relationship between athlete sport anxiety      and various sport outcomes (e.g., performance and dropout). For the majority of      athletes involved in sport, the coach is an influential element of the      competitive experience. Two hundred and twenty-eight athletes from 15 sports,      completed the Sport Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Coaching Behavior Scale for Sport      (CBS-S). The predictive ability of athletes' perceived frequency of seven      coaching behaviours (physical training, mental preparation, goal setting,      technical skills, competition strategies, personal rapport and negative personal       rapport) on four forms of sport anxiety (total anxiety, somatic anxiety,      concentration disruption and worry) was examined. Results indicate that negative       personal rapport was a significant predictor of all measured forms of sport      anxiety while competition strategies was a significant predictor for total      anxiety, concentration disruption, and worry. Other behaviours were not      significant. The findings suggest that negative rapport between coach and athlete      is an important contributor to athlete anxiety. In addition, behaviours that the       coach demonstrates relative to competition can be influential in reducing athlete      anxiety.FAU - Baker, JAU  - Baker JAD  - University of Queensland, Department of Human Movement Studies.FAU - Cote, JAU  - Cote JFAU - Hawes, RAU  - Hawes RLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - AUSTRALIATA  - J Sci Med SportJT  - Journal of science and medicine in sport / Sports Medicine AustraliaJID - 9812598SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - Anxiety/*etiologyMH  - AuthoritarianismMH  - CognitionMH  - *Competitive BehaviorMH  - FemaleMH  - GoalsMH  - HumansMH  - Interpersonal RelationsMH  - *LeadershipMH  - MaleMH  - Motor SkillsMH  - Regression AnalysisMH  - Sports/*education/*psychologyMH  - *TeachingEDAT- 2000/12/05 11:00MHDA- 2001/06/02 10:01CRDT- 2000/12/05 11:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Sci Med Sport. 2000 Jun;3(2):110-9.PMID- 11085029OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20001208DCOM- 20001208LR  - 20071115IS  - 0023-7205 (Print)IS  - 0023-7205 (Linking)VI  - 97IP  - 43DP  - 2000 Oct 25TI  - [Sports and head injuries.

As explained in this article, the most recent guidelines for the management of      head injuries in sports adopted by the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) have      been adapted for the Swedish sports society. The guidelines include a grading      scale of head injuries in sports, a sideline evaluation to aid physicians,      coaches and athletes in the acute situation, and a management strategy for safe      return to play after a head injury. The use of these guidelines will facilitate      appropriate acute and subacute management and thereby prevent repeated head      injuries that could lead to potentially catastrophic outcome or long-term      cognitive sequelae.FAU - Lexell, JAU  - Lexell JAD  - Hjarnskadesektionen, Rehabcentrum/Orup. jan.lexell@skane.seFAU - Romner, BAU  - Romner BFAU - Tegner, YAU  - Tegner YLA  - swePT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewTT  - Idrott och skallskador.

The psychological characteristics of a player might      influence his way of playing football (in particular with respect to fair play)      and also his risk of injury. A group of 588 football players were studied by      questionnaire; additionally, reaction time tests were performed. Psychological      characteristics were assessed by three established self-evaluation      questionnaires: the Athletic Coping Skills Inventory, the State Competitive      Anxiety Test, and the State-Trait-Anger-Expression-Inventory. Football-specific      characteristics that were investigated included playing experience and positions       played, style of play, number of training hours and games, as well as aspects of       fair play. Reaction time was tested twice: without the influence of physical      exercise and immediately after a 12-minute run. A significant reduction in      reaction time was observed after physical exercise. In high-level players, the      reaction time immediately after the 12-minute run was significantly shorter than       it was in low-level players. The questionnaire answers given regarding fair play       clearly indicated that fair play is not paid sufficient respect. The relationship      between psychological characteristics and attitudes toward fair play was analyzed      and discussed.FAU - Junge, AAU  - Junge AAD  - Schulthess Clinic, Zurich, Switzerland.FAU - Dvorak, JAU  - Dvorak JFAU - Rosch, DAU  - Rosch DFAU - Graf-Baumann, TAU  - Graf-Baumann TFAU - Chomiak, JAU  - Chomiak JFAU - Peterson, LAU  - Peterson LLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Am J Sports MedJT  - The American journal of sports medicineJID - 7609541SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - *AttitudeMH  - Football/*psychologyMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Mental HealthMH  - *Personality InventoryMH  - Physical Fitness/psychologyMH  - PsychometricsMH  - Soccer/*psychologyMH  - Task Performance and AnalysisEDAT- 2000/10/14 11:00MHDA- 2001/02/28 10:01CRDT- 2000/10/14 11:00PST - ppublishSO  - Am J Sports Med. 2000;28(5 Suppl):S22-8.PMID- 11019733OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20010208DCOM- 20010208LR  - 20131121IS  - 0278-5919 (Print)IS  - 0278-5919 (Linking)VI  - 19IP  - 4DP  - 2000 OctTI  - Lower limb injuries in children in sports.PG  - 637-62AB  - This article presents an overview of sports-related injuries of the lower limb in      children, with emphasis on the management. The special injury-related conditions       of childhood, epidemiology, and the particular pattern of injuries are discussed.      The increased participation of children in sports will continue. Permanent damage      is a risk, and, as such, prevention should be the most important management in      this age group. For example, stretching exercises should be performed with "warm"      muscles. Excessive weight training has an unacceptable risk of injury. In      endurance sports, the "10 percent rule," which consists of increasing activity by      10% each week, probably could be applied to prevent overuse injuries. A      multifactorial approach may be helpful. The rationale for high performance,      competitive sports for children is doubtful. The optimal levels of safe training       will remain changeable and not predictable. It should be the responsibility of      parents, coaches, and healthcare professionals to try and minimize the potential       for injury and disability, and allow children to enjoy the benefits of sports.FAU - Bruns, WAU  - Bruns WAD  - Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University of Aberdeen Medical School,      Scotland.FAU - Maffulli, NAU  - Maffulli NLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Clin Sports MedJT  - Clinics in sports medicineJID - 8112473SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Athletic Injuries/diagnosis/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - Biomechanical PhenomenaMH  - ChildMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - Leg Injuries/diagnosis/physiopathology/*therapyMH  - MaleMH  - Musculoskeletal Physiological PhenomenaMH  - Risk FactorsRF  - 122EDAT- 2000/10/06 11:00MHDA- 2001/03/03 10:01CRDT- 2000/10/06 11:00PST - ppublishSO  - Clin Sports Med. 2000 Oct;19(4):637-62.PMID- 10939073OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20000912DCOM- 20000912LR  - 20041117IS  - 0031-5125 (Print)IS  - 0031-5125 (Linking)VI  - 90IP  - 3 Pt 2DP  - 2000 JunTI  - Provision of enabling technology in professional sports.PG  - 1219-30AB  - Multiple-round golf tournaments are designed intentionally to separate      individuals' scores as play proceeds. Variance analyses and consideration of      individual differences (vs group mean effects) for a sample of professional      events confirm that 3-, 4-, and 5-round tournaments show significantly increased       variability (though stable means) from first to last rounds. It is argued here      that the dispersion of scores increases as play proceeds because the more      physically or mentally fit players emerge and continue to perform best.      Furthermore, a marginal income analysis indicates that the average gain in      earnings from a one-shot improvement in score is approximately $8,000.

As the      Australian team was about to enter the main stadium for the opening ceremony, a      pedestrian bridge they were crossing collapsed, killing 4 athletes and injuring      many others. The aim of this paper is to establish the rates, types and      anatomical locations of musculoskeletal injuries incurred by members of the      Australian Maccabiah Games team, with particular reference to the impact of the      bridge collapse. In total, the 410 members of the team (360 athletes and coaches       and 50 team officials) reported 166 injuries from their participation in sport      and 30 musculoskeletal injuries associated with the collapse of the bridge. The      most common sports-related injuries were sprains and strains to the hip/thigh,      lumbar spine and ankle/foot regions, while the bridge collapse resulted in, most       commonly, sprains and contusions to the hip/thigh, knee, lower leg and ankle/foot      regions. In addition, team members incurred many medical and psychological      conditions.

Loss of body fluids containing water and electrolytes during      exercise is mostly by sweating. Sweat rates during a sporting event or activity      will vary according to a number of factors, including the size of the athlete and      his or her degree of acclimatization, the intensity of exercise, environmental      conditions and the clothing worn. The mismatch of fluid intake and fluid losses      may lead to a body water deficit. It has generally been considered that decreases      in performance become apparent when hypohydration exceeds 2% of body weight; that      performance decrements become substantial when fluid losses exceed 5% of body      weight; and that when fluid losses approach 6-10% of body weight, heat stroke and      heat exhaustion become life-threatening. Hypohydration also affects mental      functioning. Therefore, the effect of hypohydration on real-life sport may be      greater than that shown in laboratory studies of physiological performance.FAU - Naghii, M RAU  - Naghii MRAD  - Baghiyatollah (a.s.)

Concussion is also referred to as mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI).      Although the occurrence of head injuries has been studied more extensively in      American football, the findings have wider application for any MTBI. Recently,      more attention has been directed at other sports in which both boys and girls      participate. The diagnosis of MTBI is based on subjective findings and subtle      changes in mental status. Other cerebral injuries requiring emergent or urgent      neurosurgical attention should be ruled out. Objective tests such as CT scans and      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are usually without significant findings in      MTBI. Neuropsychological testing may demonstrate areas of deficiencies, however,       results may be difficult to interpret because of confounding factors.      Complications following MTBI have been known to occur. The most catastrophic of      these is second impact syndrome. There are a variety of guidelines for return to       play following a concussion, which have been designed in an effort to avoid      problems such as second impact syndrome. These guidelines are based more on      clinical experience than on scientific evidence. Education, good training and      coaching techniques, improved equipment, and rule changes and enforcement, can      all help in curbing the sports related head injuries in adolescents.FAU - Baker, R JAU  - Baker RJAD  - Department of Pediatrics, Michigan State University Kalamazoo Center for Medical       Studies, Kalamazoo 49008, USA.

However,      little information is available about community level sports injuries, or about      the sports safety policies and practices of community level sports organisations       in Australia. The aim of this paper is to present the results of a survey of      local clubs and sporting centres in the City of Hume, a local council in      Victoria. This is the first reported survey of safety practices of sporting      clubs/centres at the community level in Australia. Sixty-four clubs/centres      participated in the survey, which involved face-to-face interviews with      representatives from the participating clubs/centres. A major finding was that      whilst sports bodies perform certain activities typically associated with      preventing sports injuries, they often do not have formal policies or written      objectives which recognise the safety of their participants as an important goal.      The sports safety measures reported to be adopted by the surveyed clubs/centres      included use of protective equipment, accredited coaches, sports trainers,      encouraging warm-ups, modified rules for juniors and checking of playing areas      and facilities for environmental hazards. The provision of first aid services      (including personnel and equipment) varied across the sporting clubs/centres. The      major barriers towards improving sports safety were reported to be a lack of      funds, the media's attitude towards sports injuries and the role of the local      council as the owner of sporting facilities. There is also a clear role for      researchers to improve the dissemination of key findings from their injury      prevention research in a form that can be readily used at the grass roots of      sports participation.FAU - Finch, C FAU  - Finch CFAD  - School of Human Movement, Deakin University, Victoria, Australia.FAU - Hennessy, MAU  - Hennessy MLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - AUSTRALIATA  - J Sci Med SportJT  - Journal of science and medicine in sport / Sports Medicine AustraliaJID - 9812598SB  - IMMH  - Athletic Injuries/*prevention & controlMH  - AustraliaMH  - Consumer ParticipationMH  - HumansMH  - Organizational ObjectivesMH  - Safety Management/*methods/organization & administrationMH  - SocietiesMH  - *SportsEDAT- 2000/06/06 09:00MHDA- 2000/09/09 11:01CRDT- 2000/06/06 09:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Sci Med Sport. 2000 Mar;3(1):9-16.PMID- 10833730OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20000724DCOM- 20000724LR  - 20041117IS  - 0031-5125 (Print)IS  - 0031-5125 (Linking)VI  - 90IP  - 2DP  - 2000 AprTI  - Coaches' expectations and beliefs regarding benefits of youth sport      participation.PG  - 399-402AB  - Although many have investigated why children participate in sport, little is      known about what adults expect children to gain from participation.

Most of these athletes report      beginning smokeless tobacco use in middle or high school. West Virginia has      significantly higher rates of smokeless tobacco use among adolescent and adult      males than the general population. Since West Virginia athletes may be      particularly vulnerable to smokeless tobacco use, West Virginia coaches can be      critical agents in smokeless tobacco prevention and intervention. This study      surveyed West Virginia middle and high school coaches' 1) attitudes toward      smokeless tobacco, 2) actions toward athletes who use smokeless tobacco, 3)      intentions to provide intervention for users, and 4) tobacco use history. Results      indicated coaches had unfavorable attitudes toward smokeless tobacco, perceived      it as a problem, and were willing to help athletes quit. These findings provide      support for development of training programs for middle and high school coaches      to act as smokeless tobacco intervention agents.FAU - Horn, K AAU  - Horn KAAD  - School of Dentistry, West Virginia University, Morgantown 26506-9190, USA.      khorn@hsc.wvu.eduFAU - Maniar, S DAU  - Maniar SDFAU - Dino, G AAU  - Dino GAFAU - Gao, XAU  - Gao XFAU - Meckstroth, R LAU  - Meckstroth RLLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - UNITED STATESTA  - J Sch HealthJT  - The Journal of school healthJID - 0376370SB  - IMSB  - NMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - *Attitude to HealthMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - *Plants, ToxicMH  - Postal ServiceMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - *SportsMH  - *TeachingMH  - Tobacco Use Cessation/*methodsMH  - *Tobacco, SmokelessMH  - West VirginiaEDAT- 2000/04/14 09:00MHDA- 2000/05/16 09:00CRDT- 2000/04/14 09:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Sch Health. 2000 Mar;70(3):89-94.PMID- 10752009OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20000620DCOM- 20000620LR  - 20061115IS  - 0009-9228 (Print)IS  - 0009-9228 (Linking)VI  - 39IP  - 3DP  - 2000 MarTI  - Adolescents and sports: risk or benefit?PG  - 161-6AB  - In order to begin to compensate for a lack of data on the effects of athletic      participation in the development of adolescent mental health patterns, as well as      to assess general health of the adolescent population, the Juvenile Wellness and       Health Inventory (JWHS-76) was administered to 1,769 high school students.

A systematic review of the literature.PG  - 753-60AB  - To assess the published evidence on the effectiveness of various approaches to      the prevention of ankle sprains in athletes, we used textbooks, journals, and      experts in the field of sports medicine to identify citations. We identified 113       studies reporting the risk of ankle sprains in sports, methods to provide      support, the effect of these interventions on performance, and comparison of      prevention efforts. The most common risk factor for ankle sprain in sports is      history of a previous sprain. Ten citations of studies involving athletes in      basketball, football, soccer, or volleyball compared alternative methods of      prevention. Methods tested included wrapping the ankle with tape or cloth,      orthoses, high-top shoes, or some combination of these methods. Most studies      indicate that appropriately applied braces, tape, or orthoses do not adversely      affect performance. Based on our review, we recommend that athletes with a      sprained ankle complete supervised rehabilitation before returning to practice or      competition, and those athletes suffering a moderate or severe sprain should wear      an appropriate orthosis for at least 6 months. Both coaches and players must      assume responsibility for prevention of injuries in sports.

The objective of the present      study was to determine the direction and strength of the associations between the      frequency of sport and health variables; in particular, perceptions of health,      self image, substance use and experimental behaviours. Data were collected as      part of the 1993 Swiss Multicentric Adolescent Survey on Health. In this survey,       anonymous self-administered questionnaires were distributed to a national      representative sample of 10,000 in-school adolescents (15-20 years of age).      Univariate analyses explored the relationships between the level of sport      activity and health variables; then logistic regression analyses examined the      strength of these relationships. According to the results, half of the sample do       sports more than twice a week, boys more often as part of a sports club.      Differences between non-athletic and athletic adolescents describe the latter as       having less somatic complaints, more confidence in their future health, a better       body image, a lesser tendency to attempt suicide, a higher frequency of use of      the car seat belt, and a lower use of tobacco, wine and marijuana. Links between       the frequency of sport activity and the locus of control related to health,      general satisfaction with life or sexual behaviours are less strong. It must be      noticed that the cross-sectional data collection precludes the establishment of a      causal relationship between exercise and health behaviours. However, the existing      links underline the coexistence of positive health characteristics and sport      activity, suggesting that an incitement to get involved in physical activity may       be a necessary component of a comprehensive prevention approach among      adolescents.FAU - Ferron, CAU  - Ferron CAD  - Institut Universitaire de Medecine Sociale et Preventive, Lausanne, Switzerland.FAU - Narring, FAU  - Narring FFAU - Cauderay, MAU  - Cauderay MFAU - Michaud, P AAU  - Michaud PALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Multicenter StudyPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - ENGLANDTA  - Health Educ ResJT  - Health education researchJID - 8608459SB  - TMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - Analysis of VarianceMH  - Cross-Sectional StudiesMH  - FemaleMH  - *Health BehaviorMH  - *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, PracticeMH  - HumansMH  - Logistic ModelsMH  - MaleMH  - Odds RatioMH  - Sports/*psychologyMH  - SwitzerlandEDAT- 1999/07/01MHDA- 1999/07/01 00:01CRDT- 1999/07/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Health Educ Res. 1999 Apr;14(2):225-33.PMID- 10362387OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19990714DCOM- 19990714LR  - 20041117IS  - 0264-0414 (Print)IS  - 0264-0414 (Linking)VI  - 17IP  - 3DP  - 1999 MarTI  - Perceptions of the sport psychologist by female university athletes.PG  - 205-12AB  - In this study we explored the existence of a favourable attitude towards sport      psychologists by female athletes in relation to other sport-oriented and mental      health professionals. Ninety female student athletes made judgements of      similarity between 11 practitioner terms using the triad method. A rank-order      task was also completed, where the 11 professionals were ranked on three      expertise variables in sporting, mental and physical issues. The results were      analysed using (1) the metric scaling procedure of correspondence analysis, (2)      cultural consensus analysis and (3) PROperty FITting analysis. A two-dimensional       solution provided the best interpretation of the similarity judgements. The      correspondence analysis configuration positioned the sport psychologist centrally      between a sport-oriented pair and the cluster of mental health professionals.      Participants reported adequate consensus on all three expertise variables, which       is consistent with the assumptions of Cultural Consensus Theory. Consistent with       earlier research, the three variables were salient in the participants'      similarity judgements of sport and mental health professionals. Our results      suggest the existence of a more favourable perception of the sport psychologist      and a distancing from a direct association with mental health practitioners.      However, the centrality of the term may indicate a more cloudy distinction as to       where the sport psychologist exists in relation to other professionals.FAU - Brooks, J EAU  - Brooks JEAD  - Cheltenham & Gloucester College of Higher Education, Gluocestershire, UK.FAU - Bull, S JAU  - Bull SJLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - ENGLANDTA  - J Sports SciJT  - Journal of sports sciencesJID - 8405364SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - *AttitudeMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - *PsychologyMH  - *SportsEDAT- 1999/06/11MHDA- 1999/06/11 00:01CRDT- 1999/06/11 00:00AID - 10.1080/026404199366109 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Sci. 1999 Mar;17(3):205-12.PMID- 10349575OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19990922DCOM- 19990922LR  - 20071114IS  - 1090-1981 (Print)IS  - 1090-1981 (Linking)VI  - 26IP  - 3DP  - 1999 JunTI  - Communicating about youth's sun exposure risk to soccer coaches and parents: a      pilot study in Georgia.PG  - 385-95AB  - Efforts to increase the sun-protective behaviors of children were extended to      outdoor recreational sports and youth soccer settings in this study.

The pilot demonstrated coaches' willingness to participate in sun protection      promotion to youth: Youths indicated that coaches and parents were more likely to      tell youths to wear sunscreen after the training than before, and coaches      perceived getting youths to wear sunscreen to be less difficult than before.FAU - Parrott, RAU  - Parrott RAD  - University of Georgia, Athens 30602-1725, USA. rparrott@arches.uga.eduFAU - Duggan, AAU  - Duggan AFAU - Cremo, JAU  - Cremo JFAU - Eckles, AAU  - Eckles AFAU - Jones, KAU  - Jones KFAU - Steiner, CAU  - Steiner CLA  - engGR  - U56/CCU411015-03/PHS HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPT  - Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.PL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Health Educ BehavJT  - Health education & behavior : the official publication of the Society for Public       Health EducationJID - 9704962SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - Analysis of VarianceMH  - ChildMH  - CurriculumMH  - FemaleMH  - GeorgiaMH  - Health Education/*methodsMH  - *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, PracticeMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - ParentsMH  - Pilot ProjectsMH  - Self EfficacyMH  - Skin Neoplasms/*prevention & controlMH  - *SoccerMH  - Sunburn/*prevention & controlEDAT- 1999/06/01MHDA- 1999/06/01 00:01CRDT- 1999/06/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Health Educ Behav. 1999 Jun;26(3):385-95.PMID- 10326905OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19990528DCOM- 19990528LR  - 20051116IS  - 0003-9993 (Print)IS  - 0003-9993 (Linking)VI  - 80IP  - 5 Suppl 1DP  - 1999 MayTI  - Musculoskeletal rehabilitation and sports medicine. 4.

The aim of this study is to evaluate performance improvement with      imagery quality estimated during ANS recording. Volleyball training ("receiving      serve") afforded us the experimental paradigm. Subjects were required to pass an       opponent's serve to a given team mate. The receiver's performance was evaluated      from the accuracy of his pass to the targeted team mate. From these first test      results, subjects were divided into two equivalent groups: imagers and controls.       After mental practice the two groups were submitted to a posttest similar to the       first one. During the pretest, posttest actual practice as well as the last      session of corresponding mental rehearsal, six autonomic parameters were      continuously recorded. Furthermore, and for the first time, a grade obtained from      four different aspects of this response permits qualitative evaluation of each      subject's mental imagery. This estimation, based on the well-established link      between performance and autonomic response, is validated by the fact that good      correlation was obtained between this grade and the performance improvement of      each of the "imager" group subjects.FAU - Roure, RAU  - Roure RAD  - Universite Lyon I.

Because the nature of sports participation is highly organized      and competitive, it is imperative that parents, coaches, physicians, and other      clinicians remember that they may be placing increased pressures on the      adolescent to perform and practice. The authors review the impact of physical      growth and psychosocial development and also describe how substance abuse,      depression, and aggressive behavior may or may not be influenced by sports      participation.FAU - Patel, D RAU  - Patel DRAD  - Michigan State University, Kalamazoo Center for Medical Studies, Kalamazoo 49008,      USA.FAU - Pratt, H DAU  - Pratt HDFAU - Greydanus, D EAU  - Greydanus DELA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Adolesc MedJT  - Adolescent medicine (Philadelphia, Pa.)JID - 9006270SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Adolescent Behavior/physiologyMH  - ChildMH  - Child Development/*physiologyMH  - Data CollectionMH  - FemaleMH  - *GrowthMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - PsychologyMH  - Sports/*physiology/psychologyMH  - United StatesRF  - 68EDAT- 1999/02/03MHDA- 1999/02/03 00:01CRDT- 1999/02/03 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Adolesc Med. 1998 Oct;9(3):425-40, v.PMID- 9894049OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19990209DCOM- 19990209LR  - 20131121IS  - 1056-4993 (Print)IS  - 1056-4993 (Linking)VI  - 7IP  - 4DP  - 1998 OctTI  - A developmental and psychoeducational approach to reducing conflict and abuse in       little league and youth sports. The sport psychiatrist's role.PG  - 891-918AB  - To stress a point made earlier, whether backyard or Little League, the tone of      the youth sports experience is greatly influenced by the player and team      selection process. All possible steps should therefore be taken to ensure that      the draft is held on high moral ground, and that the adult participants, even on       the Major Little League level, behave cooperatively rather than competitively. If      it is the community's hope that Little League will "build character, and not      characters," it must embrace Shields and Bredemeier's work and flood the Draft      Room with the four virtues of compassion, fairness, sportspersonship, and      integrity. In one attempt to achieve fairness and balance, some leagues enter      player evaluations into a data base and allow a properly programmed computer to      project equal teams. It might be best, however, to borrow a page from backyard      baseball, and make team selection a more cooperative venture. Wolff has proposed       such a draft model. He recommends that each child's name be placed on a big      blackboard at the beginning of the draft. All assembled give their assessment of       each child's baseball ability, and a consensus skill-level number (one through      five) is entered next to each player's name. If there are 72 names, and the      league wishes to form six teams of 12 players each, dividing up the rated players      so that the skill levels balance would assure everyone (coaches, parents, the      league, and by extension, the community) that the teams were of relatively equal       strength. No coach at this point would know to which team he or she was being      assigned, so there would be no motive for "stacking" a given team. Each team      would be designated by a letter of the alphabet, and the six letters would be      thrown into a hat. The six coaches would then blindly pick a team from the hat.      If a coach desired that his or her child play on his or her team, fair      adjustments (trades) could be made subject to majority agreement. The three draft      models can be summarized as follows: Draft Model 1 Public tryouts Previous year      rating Coach makes selections Can be very competitive, lacking in "character" Can      result in very unequal teams Draft Model 2 Player evaluations placed into a data       base Properly programmed computer projects equal teams Draft Model 3 All names      placed on a blackboard Relative merits of players discussed Equal team drawn up      and placed into a hat Adjustments can be made for coach's child If practical,      this author suggests that coaches not pick a name for the team until the first      team meeting or practice, when that task can be given to the children. In a      symbolic way, this returns some of the sport to them while encouraging social      interaction among new teammates, and helping the coach detect who the leaders      are. Names of professional teams in the major sports, especially baseball, are to      be avoided, as they fuel longstanding unconscious associations and fantasies, and      may subtly tilt all participants toward the professional "win at all costs"      mentality. No one draft model is perfect for every town, and even the most      ethical attempt to achieve balance among teams can be severely tested by parents       who request that their athlete be placed on the same team as another child for      social or car pool reasons. Such requests are not inviolate, however. For      example, they do not usually dictate placement in school classes, and car pools      are frequently disrupted when children, in individual sports such as Tae Kwan Do,      reach different ability levels, and so attend practices at different times.      Baseball is no longer the national pasttime and, as we approach the millennium,      American children have too many other attractive, competing interests and time      demands to spontaneously organize a pick-up game. One coach shared with the      author that his saddest moment in CAP League came when he arrived at 6 PM at a      field that had been "reserved" for his team, and found a group of boys who were      playing a pick-up game. The coach's impulse was to set his boys freFAU - Kamm, R LAU  - Kamm RLAD  - Medical College of Pennsylvania-Hahnemann School of Medicine, Philadelphia, USA.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Child Adolesc Psychiatr Clin N AmJT  - Child and adolescent psychiatric clinics of North AmericaJID - 9313451SB  - IMMH  - Baseball/*psychologyMH  - ChildMH  - Child, PreschoolMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Parents/psychologyMH  - Physician's RoleMH  - *PsychiatryMH  - Self ConceptMH  - United StatesMH  - Volunteers/psychologyRF  - 44EDAT- 1999/01/20MHDA- 1999/01/20 00:01CRDT- 1999/01/20 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Child Adolesc Psychiatr Clin N Am. 1998 Oct;7(4):891-918.PMID- 9894048OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19990209DCOM- 19990209LR  - 20051116IS  - 1056-4993 (Print)IS  - 1056-4993 (Linking)VI  - 7IP  - 4DP  - 1998 OctTI  - Comprehending role conflicts in the coaching of children, adolescents, and young       adults.

This article addresses the      historical evolution of youth sport programs, then identifies opportunities for      adults to facilitate developmental progress and surmount emotional obstacles as      they interact in sport activities with children ranging from preschool ages      through adolescence. Youth sports are viewed as offering tremendous opportunities      to teach not only physical skills and playing strategies, but also psychological       skills and coping strategies that have applicability throughout life. A      developmental rationale is provided to support recommendations for parents and      coaches. Child and adolescent psychiatrists are faced with the challenge of      collaborating with other professionals and making their knowledge base available       to the volunteers who coach in and support youth sport programs.FAU - Libman, SAU  - Libman SAD  - Department of Psychiatry, University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.      slmd852@aol.comLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Child Adolesc Psychiatr Clin N AmJT  - Child and adolescent psychiatric clinics of North AmericaJID - 9313451SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - ChildMH  - *Child DevelopmentMH  - Child, PreschoolMH  - FemaleMH  - Guidelines as TopicMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - *Parent-Child RelationsMH  - *Sports/psychology/trendsMH  - Teaching/methodsMH  - *VolunteersRF  - 71EDAT- 1999/01/20MHDA- 1999/01/20 00:01CRDT- 1999/01/20 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Child Adolesc Psychiatr Clin N Am. 1998 Oct;7(4):725-44, vii.PMID- 9885031OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19990302DCOM- 19990302LR  - 20041117IS  - 0031-5125 (Print)IS  - 0031-5125 (Linking)VI  - 87IP  - 3 Pt 1DP  - 1998 DecTI  - Leadership styles of elite Dixie youth baseball coaches.PG  - 754AB  - Chelladurai and Saleh's Leadership Scale for Sports was administered to 52 elite       Dixie Youth baseball coaches.

A database search yielded only seven prospective, randomised studies, of which      two showed soccer and running injuries to be preventable using a combination of      preventive measures. Other clinical trials have shown it possible to prevent      certain types of injury in other sports as well. The use of prophylactic ankle      stabilisers and/or proprioceptive ankle disc training to reduce the incidence of       ankle sprain is well documented. Of two studies presenting preventive measures to      reduce the incidence of knee ligament injuries, one showed the risk of knee      sprain in American football to be reducible by means of a knee brace, and the      other that the risk of anterior cruciate ligament injuries in soccer could be      reduced by proprioceptive training. Several commonly used preventive measures,      such as stretching, taping, mental training and controlled rehabilitation, still       await further documentation or the scrutiny of a clinical trial.FAU - Ekstrand, JAU  - Ekstrand JAD  - Idrottskliniken, Linkoping Medical Center.FAU - Lundmark, AAU  - Lundmark ALA  - swePT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewTT  - Kan idrotts- och motionsskador forebyggas?

Coaching knowledge was studied from a cognitive ergonomics perspective      based on the task activity model. According to this model, a task is a set of      constraints facing individuals. To meet the demands imposed by these constraints,      an individual engages in an adaptative activity which can be studied from the      point of view of his or her knowledge and cognitive operating modes. In-depth      interviews were conducted after observation of five training sessions, and the      verbal protocols obtained were coded inductively. The results showed that      coaching tasks were considered by coaches as a set of interacting constraints      which generate complex, contradictory, and ill defined problems. Coaches'      operating modes appeared to be based on organization routines, cognitive      anticipation on flexible plans, flexible on-site adaptation, joint control of      training with athletes, and involvement in the training situation based on past      experiences.FAU - Saury, JAU  - Saury JAD  - National Sailing School Ministry of Youth and Sport at Saint Pierre Quiberon,      France. saury@hol.frFAU - Durand, MAU  - Durand MLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Res Q Exerc SportJT  - Research quarterly for exercise and sportJID - 8006373SB  - IMMH  - Adaptation, PhysiologicalMH  - Adaptation, PsychologicalMH  - AdultMH  - BehaviorMH  - Cognition/physiologyMH  - EmotionsMH  - FranceMH  - Human EngineeringMH  - HumansMH  - Interpersonal RelationsMH  - Interviews as TopicMH  - MaleMH  - MemoryMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Problem SolvingMH  - Psychomotor Performance/physiologyMH  - Sports/*education/physiology/psychologyMH  - Task Performance and AnalysisMH  - *Teaching/classification/organization & administrationMH  - ThinkingEDAT- 1998/10/20MHDA- 1998/10/20 00:01CRDT- 1998/10/20 00:00AID - 10.1080/02701367.1998.10607692 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Res Q Exerc Sport. 1998 Sep;69(3):254-66.PMID- 9773163OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19981209DCOM- 19981209LR  - 20140617IS  - 0306-3674 (Print)IS  - 0306-3674 (Linking)VI  - 32IP  - 3DP  - 1998 SepTI  - The "Hoddle Muddle": using faith healers and other complementary therapists in      sports medicine.PG  - 195FAU - Ernst, EAU  - Ernst EAD  - Department of Complementary Medicine, Postgraduate Medical School, University of       Exeter, United Kingdom.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - ENGLANDTA  - Br J Sports MedJT  - British journal of sports medicineJID - 0432520SB  - IMCIN - Br J Sports Med. 1999 Apr;33(2):140.

The participants, 191 Big Ten university basketball players      (94 men, 97 women), responded to a specially constructed instrument. The genders       did not differ in their coaching self-efficacy, preferred occupational valence,      and perceived barriers. Relative to men, women perceived greater valence in      coaching (p < .001). Women with a female coach perceived greater valence in      coaching (p < .05) and expressed less concern with perceived discrimination (p <       .05) than those with a male coach. Perceived self-efficacy and preferred      occupational valence were differentially related to the desire to coach at      various levels. Working Hours most negatively affected the desire to coach at      every level (R > .20).FAU - Everhart, C BAU  - Everhart CBAD  - School of Physical Activity and Educational Services, Ohio State University, USA.FAU - Chelladurai, PAU  - Chelladurai PLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Res Q Exerc SportJT  - Research quarterly for exercise and sportJID - 8006373SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - *Career ChoiceMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - *Job SatisfactionMH  - MaleMH  - *Physical Education and TrainingMH  - SchoolsMH  - Sex FactorsMH  - *SportsMH  - UniversitiesEDAT- 1998/06/23MHDA- 1998/06/23 00:01CRDT- 1998/06/23 00:00AID - 10.1080/02701367.1998.10607683 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Res Q Exerc Sport. 1998 Jun;69(2):188-200.PMID- 20086820OWN - NLMSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINEDA  - 20100120DCOM- 20121002IS  - 0091-3847 (Print)IS  - 0091-3847 (Linking)VI  - 26IP  - 6DP  - 1998 JunTI  - Reviving ethics in sports time for physicians to act.PG  - 39-40LID - 10.3810/psm.1998.06.1029 [doi]AB  - When will we face the fact that we're producing some really ugly, violent young      men?" observed my friend, an internationally prominent basketball coach, who is      given neither to hand-wringing nor to strident overstatement.

Even though the management of concussion remains      somewhat controversial, certain principles of neuroscience regarding mental      status alterations and other symptoms resulting from concussion are well accepted      by medical experts. Several authors have previously published management      strategies for sports-related concussion based on their own experiences, but this      article will describe the formal process of developing guidelines for the      diagnosis and management of concussion in sports. The processes of literature      review, evidence-based analysis, and consensus building are described. This      article includes the grading scale, sideline evaluation, and management strategy       adopted as a practice parameter by the American Academy of Neurology.

The implications for the      process of practice in sport contexts are explored with reference to the      information-processing approach to motor behaviour and the newer ecological      paradigm. Issues are raised with current principles of practice based on      traditional theoretical ideas. A practice strategy that gives greater weight to      the guided exploration of the practice workspace jointly defined by the      properties of the individual's subsystems, the specific task and the environment       is advocated. Such a constraints-led perspective supersedes previous distinctions      between rudimentary and voluntary skills. Sports scientists, coaches, teachers      and movement rehabilitation therapists are invited to review current practices in      the light of recent theoretical advances from the ecological perspective.FAU - Handford, CAU  - Handford CAD  - Motor Control Group, Department of Exercise and Sport Science, The Manchester      Metropolitan University, Alsager, UK.FAU - Davids, KAU  - Davids KFAU - Bennett, SAU  - Bennett SFAU - Button, CAU  - Button CLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - ENGLANDTA  - J Sports SciJT  - Journal of sports sciencesJID - 8405364SB  - IMMH  - Adaptation, PhysiologicalMH  - Behavior/physiologyMH  - Cognition/physiologyMH  - EnvironmentMH  - HumansMH  - Mental Processes/physiologyMH  - Models, BiologicalMH  - Models, PsychologicalMH  - Motor Skills/*physiologyMH  - Perception/physiologyMH  - Physical Therapy ModalitiesMH  - *Practice (Psychology)MH  - Psychomotor Performance/physiologyMH  - Sports/education/*physiologyMH  - Task Performance and AnalysisRF  - 123EDAT- 1998/03/05MHDA- 1998/03/05 00:01CRDT- 1998/03/05 00:00AID - 10.1080/026404197367056 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Sci. 1997 Dec;15(6):621-40.PMID- 9454265OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19980204DCOM- 19980204LR  - 20131121IS  - 0937-2032 (Print)IS  - 0937-2032 (Linking)VI  - 47IP  - 11DP  - 1997 NovTI  - [Value of sports in treatment of psychiatric illness].PG  - 379-93AB  - Several studies in healthy volunteers have shown a positive effect of endurance      training on anxiety, depressive symptoms, self-esteem, concentration and stress      tolerance. There are only a few controlled studies examining the therapeutic      potential of exercise in psychiatric disorders. However, there is good evidence      that exercise is effective in mild to moderate depression and in anxiety      disorders. The therapeutic effect did not correlate with changes in      cardiopulmonary fitness in the majority of studies. Therefore, other      neurobiological and psychological mechanisms are discussed which might explain      the effectiveness of regular physical training. The authors offer a variety of      suggestions, how exercise could be integrated and evaluated in the treatment of      psychiatric disorders.FAU - Broocks, AAU  - Broocks AAD  - Georg-August-Universitat Gottingen, Klinik und Poliklinik fur Psychiatrie.FAU - Meyer, T FAU  - Meyer TFFAU - George, AAU  - George AFAU - Pekrun, GAU  - Pekrun GFAU - Hillmer-Vogel, UAU  - Hillmer-Vogel UFAU - Hajak, GAU  - Hajak GFAU - Bandelow, BAU  - Bandelow BFAU - Ruther, EAU  - Ruther ELA  - gerPT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewTT  - Zum Stellenwert von Sport in der Behandlung psychischer Erkrankungen.PL  - GERMANYTA  - Psychother Psychosom Med PsycholJT  - Psychotherapie, Psychosomatik, medizinische PsychologieJID - 8002823RN  - 333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)SB  - IMMH  - Anxiety Disorders/physiopathology/psychology/*rehabilitationMH  - Combined Modality TherapyMH  - Depressive Disorder/physiopathology/psychology/*rehabilitationMH  - Exercise/physiology/*psychologyMH  - HumansMH  - Mental Disorders/physiopathology/psychology/*rehabilitationMH  - Physical Fitness/physiology/psychologyMH  - Serotonin/physiologyMH  - Treatment OutcomeRF  - 95EDAT- 1998/02/07MHDA- 1998/02/07 00:01CRDT- 1998/02/07 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Psychother Psychosom Med Psychol. 1997 Nov;47(11):379-93.PMID- 9428990OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19980212DCOM- 19980212LR  - 20041117IS  - 0813-6289 (Print)IS  - 0813-6289 (Linking)VI  - 29IP  - 4DP  - 1997 DecTI  - Coping with performance slumps: factor analysis of the Ways of Coping in Sport      Scale.PG  - 99-105AB  - The measurement properties of the Ways of Coping in Sport Scale (WOCS) were      examined using performance slumps as a frame of reference.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The sailors      responded to a simple questionnaire. SETTING: The questionnaire was administered       as part of an introductory seminar on sport science during a training camp.      PARTICIPANTS: The participants were 28 (22 male, 6 female) elite New Zealand      Olympic class sailors. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASURES: The questionnaire asked      whether or not they used a training race diary, enquired about their current and       past injuries and their knowledge and use of sport science in the areas of      nutrition, psychology and physical training. RESULTS: Only ten (36%) of the      sailors kept a training/race diary. Whilst only four (14%) had a current injury,       sixteen (57%) reported an injury in the previous three years. The injuries were      in the lower back (45%), knee (22%), shoulder (18%), and arm (15%). Although      nineteen (68%) of the sailors had experienced dehydration during racing, the      average volume of fluid reported to be taken on a four hour sail was only 0.9      litre, of which only an average of 0.7 litres (77%) was reported to be drunk. All      the sailors reported being sometimes (46%) to very often (3%) anxious before      races and sometimes (43%) to always (7%) being frustrated with their own      mistakes. Only one sailor reported never having negative thoughts whilst fifteen       (53%) reported having them sometimes, and seven (25%) often or very often.      Twenty-four (86%) of the sailors reported that they sometimes had a loss of      concentration near the end of the race. Whilst eighteen (64%) reported practising      relaxation and seventeen (61%) reported practising visualisation as a mental      skill, only five (18%) practised progressive mental relaxation, two (7%)      practised meditation and none practised yoga. Seventeen (61%) undertook      strength/circuit training, ten (36%) flexibility and twenty-one (75%) off water      aerobic training. Twenty-four (86%) reported undertaking on-water aerobic      training. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that there is considerable scope for       improvement in the knowledge and use of sports science amongst elite New Zealand       Olympic class sailors.FAU - Legg, S JAU  - Legg SJAD  - Centre for Sport Performance, University of Auckland, New Zealand.FAU - Smith, PAU  - Smith PFAU - Slyfield, DAU  - Slyfield DFAU - Miller, A BAU  - Miller ABFAU - Wilcox, HAU  - Wilcox HFAU - Gilberd, CAU  - Gilberd CLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - ITALYTA  - J Sports Med Phys FitnessJT  - The Journal of sports medicine and physical fitnessJID - 0376337SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - Anxiety/psychologyMH  - Arm Injuries/etiologyMH  - Athletic Injuries/classificationMH  - AttentionMH  - AttitudeMH  - Back Injuries/etiologyMH  - Dehydration/etiology/prevention & controlMH  - DrinkingMH  - FemaleMH  - Fluid TherapyMH  - FrustrationMH  - Health EducationMH  - *Health Knowledge, Attitudes, PracticeMH  - HumansMH  - Imagery (Psychotherapy)MH  - Knee Injuries/etiologyMH  - MaleMH  - New ZealandMH  - Nutritional Physiological PhenomenaMH  - Physical FitnessMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Records as TopicMH  - Relaxation TherapyMH  - ScienceMH  - Shoulder/injuriesMH  - *Sports/education/physiology/psychologyEDAT- 1998/01/04MHDA- 1998/01/04 00:01CRDT- 1998/01/04 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Med Phys Fitness. 1997 Sep;37(3):213-7.PMID- 9356756OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19971211DCOM- 19971211LR  - 20140617IS  - 0008-350X (Print)IS  - 0008-350X (Linking)VI  - 43DP  - 1997 OctTI  - Family physicians and sports-injury care.

DESIGN: A telephone survey using both closed      and open-ended questions was conducted. Information was collected as background      information to a larger study investigating coaches' decisions about allowing      injured athletes to compete. SETTING: All 28 competitive gymnastics clubs in the       province of Alberta. The clubs trained athletes for all competitive levels.      PARTICIPANTS: All 70 coaches registered with the Alberta Gymnastics Federation as      working with female gymnasts were approached; 64 coaches were interviewed. MAIN      OUTCOME MEASURES: Injury education, access to medical care, perceptions of      sports-injury treatment provided by family physicians, strategies employed for      overcoming perceived poor advice. RESULTS: Education in injury care and      management was varied, as was access to medical care. Direct access to      sport-specific medical care was available at three of the five elite-level clubs,      an arrangement stemming from dissatisfaction with the conventional health care      system. At all competitive levels, most coaches were dissatisfied with the      recommendations they received from family physicians. Various strategies were      employed to acquire more suitable advice.

Most coaches (82%) considered themselves very knowledgeable      about wrestling but less informed about sport nutrition, weight loss, and vitamin      supplements. They used a variety of nutrition resources, but only 36% had      attended nutrition workshops. Almost all coaches were interested in learning more      about specific nutrition topics. More experienced coaches attended nutrition      workshops and felt more informed about weight loss and sport nutrition. The mean       percentage of correct responses to questions about weight loss was 64%, training       diets 59%, dehydration 57%, body composition 52%, and eating disorders 80%; the      mean score for healthy attitudes about weight loss was 69%, training diets 34%,      dehydration 29%, body composition 70%, and eating disorders 69%.

Guidelines for optimal practices.PG  - 38-54AB  - Team sports require players to perform multiple work bouts at near maximal      effort, punctuated with intervals of low intensity exercise or rest for the      duration of a game. Such activity patterns are associated with a significant loss      of body water which has a negative impact on physical and mental performance, as       well as temperature regulation. There are a number of ways in which sweat losses       incurred during team sports differ from those measured during prolonged,      continuous exercise. Firstly, the work rate in team sports is intermittent,      largely unpredictable and random in nature. Second, analyses of various team      sports reveal that such games are characterised by a high degree of inter and      intra-individual variability in work rates between players from the same sport.      Finally, team players are less able to anticipate sweat losses than athletes      competing in events which involve prolonged, continuous, moderate intensity      exercise. Yet, compared with most endurance events, many team sports offer      frequent opportunities to ingest adequate volumes of fluid and thus prevent      exercise-induced hypohydration. The present review details the findings of modern      studies which have determined body water losses and fluid intake practices of      athletes from a variety of team sports. Special considerations which influence      sweat loss and fluid intake that are unique to team sports are discussed, and      guidelines for sound hydration strategies during training and competition are      provided.FAU - Burke, L MAU  - Burke LMAD  - Department of Sports Nutrition, Australian Institute of Sport, Canberra,      Australia. lburke@ausport.gov.auFAU - Hawley, J AAU  - Hawley JALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPT  - ReviewPL  - NEW ZEALANDTA  - Sports MedJT  - Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)JID - 8412297SB  - IMMH  - Basketball/physiologyMH  - Body Temperature Regulation/physiologyMH  - Dehydration/prevention & controlMH  - Drinking/physiologyMH  - Football/physiologyMH  - HumansMH  - Sports/*physiologyMH  - Sweating/physiologyMH  - Water-Electrolyte Balance/*physiologyRF  - 71EDAT- 1997/07/01MHDA- 1997/07/01 00:01CRDT- 1997/07/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Sports Med. 1997 Jul;24(1):38-54.PMID- 9257406OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19980202DCOM- 19980202LR  - 20051116IS  - 0112-1642 (Print)IS  - 0112-1642 (Linking)VI  - 24IP  - 1DP  - 1997 JulTI  - Prevention of infectious disease transmission in sports.PG  - 1-7AB  - A variety of infectious diseases can be transmitted during competitive sports.

However do the physicians have the necessary knowledge and       attitudes and do they simply wish to take part pertinently in actions of doping      prevention? This study has been conducted in order to examine their knowledge and      attitudes in front of doping, to evaluate their role in the prevention campaign.       So 280 french physicians have randomly been selected and interviewed by      telephone. The response rate was about 62%. The selected population was made up      of 173 physicians in which were 122 males and 51 females, the average age was      44.5 +/- 6.5 years. The questioned physicians seemed to have a few knowledge      about doping, in particular through the eight families of prohibited substances      in which they only mentioned anabolic steroids and amphetamines. Only 50% of them      think doping can also concern children, therefore 33.6% had have to face this      problem in the latest 12 months. For 86.5% of the questioned physicians, doping      is a serious public health problem and 60% of them consider it as a kind of drug       addiction. According to 60.9% of them, campaigns of prevention from doping are      inefficient; and 92.5% would like to take part in it but 83.3% of them do not      feel themselves prepared enough. The results are always similar with or without      sports medicine diploma. Three different families of the physicians' attitudes      are described. The physicians' involvement in doping prevention claims an action       in two parts: to change their behaviours facing to doping they have to consider      as any health issue, to provide them with prevention efficient "tools" for their       sports patients. At last, considering doping as a public health issue and not      only as a marginal practice restricted to the athletic elite is really essential.FAU - Laure, PAU  - Laure PAD  - Centre de Sociopharmacologie-BP 87, Saint-Max.LA  - frePT  - Comparative StudyPT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticleTT  - Medecins generalistes et dopage sportif: connaissances et attitudes.PL  - FRANCETA  - Sante PubliqueJT  - Sante publique (Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France)JID - 9216153SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Attitude of Health PersonnelMH  - ChildMH  - Doping in Sports/*prevention & controlMH  - *Family PracticeMH  - FemaleMH  - FranceMH  - HumansMH  - Interviews as TopicMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - QuestionnairesEDAT- 1997/06/01 00:00MHDA- 2000/03/18 09:00CRDT- 1997/06/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Sante Publique. 1997 Jun;9(2):145-56.PMID- 9242974OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19970912DCOM- 19970912LR  - 20061115IS  - 0813-6289 (Print)IS  - 0813-6289 (Linking)VI  - 29IP  - 2DP  - 1997 JunTI  - The economic impact on families of children's participation in junior sport.PG  - 27-33AB  - The study investigated the socio-economic consequences for families of      participation in junior sport. Two hundred and twenty families in Queensland and       Victoria were surveyed from the sports of cricket, Australian football,      gymnastics, hockey, netball and tennis and twenty seven of these interviewed. The      study showed that parents make a substantial contribution in terms of financial      support to their children's participation in junior sport. Each of the sports      mode different financial demands on families depending on the yearly cycle of      training and competition, distance from facilities and coaching, costs associated      with coaching, equipment and uniforms, and representative level. It is concluded       that family income and structure are the key factors in determining the      likelihood of a child's involvement in junior sport, and that for many Australian      children, financial factors may be barriers to their participation in junior      sport.FAU - Kirk, DAU  - Kirk DAD  - University of Queensland.FAU - Carlson, TAU  - Carlson TFAU - O'Connor, AAU  - O'Connor AFAU - Burke, PAU  - Burke PFAU - Davis, KAU  - Davis KFAU - Glover, SAU  - Glover SLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - AUSTRALIATA  - Aust J Sci Med SportJT  - Australian journal of science and medicine in sportJID - 9012781SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - ChildMH  - Costs and Cost AnalysisMH  - Data CollectionMH  - *Family CharacteristicsMH  - FemaleMH  - *Financing, PersonalMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Socioeconomic FactorsMH  - Sports/*economicsEDAT- 1997/06/01MHDA- 1997/06/01 00:01CRDT- 1997/06/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Aust J Sci Med Sport. 1997 Jun;29(2):27-33.PMID- 9229448OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19970812DCOM- 19970812LR  - 20041117IS  - 0031-5125 (Print)IS  - 0031-5125 (Linking)VI  - 84IP  - 3 Pt 2DP  - 1997 JunTI  - Olympic athletes' transition from sport to workplace.PG  - 1287-95AB  - Research has supported the need for strategies to assist elite athletes with      transition from full-time athletic activity to the work place.

This paper explores the role which psychology can play when      injured athletes are rehabilitating. Rehabilitation from sport injury involves      not only physical, but psychological considerations. Topics include: the      post-injury emotional and cognitive reactions of athletes, the importance of      social support, the athlete's attitude toward recovery, the therapist's,      physician's and coach's roles during rehabilitation, strategies to increase      adherence, and effective communication between client and medical professionals.

DC procedures must      be strict and precisely followed to avoid contamination of samples, the      appearance of bias, and breaches in security and confidentiality. The process of       selecting athletes for testing can be random, nonrandom, or a combination of the       two. Escorts are used to notify athletes of their selection, verify their      identity, and accompany them to the DC station. When urine specimens are obtained      for DC, the voiding process must be directly observed. The specimen is checked      for pH and specific gravity and then processed for shipping to a laboratory to be      analyzed for banned substances. Medication histories are also obtained, giving      athletes the opportunity to declare any substance that has been taken for      legitimate medical purposes. Laboratory analysis involves screening and      confirmation phases. During the Atlanta Games, roughly 50 pharmacists      participated in the DC program as escorts or technical officers. It is logical to      involve pharmacists in DC programs because they can develop and conduct      drug-testing protocols; educate athletes, coaches, and trainers about drug use      and abuse; and help ensure the safe and effective use of medications.      Sophisticated doping-control procedures have been developed for athletic      competitions, and pharmacists have much to offer DC programs.FAU - Ambrose, P JAU  - Ambrose PJAD  - Pharmacokinetics Service, Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, CA 90801-1428, USA.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Am J Health Syst PharmJT  - American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the      American Society of Health-System PharmacistsJID - 9503023SB  - IMMH  - Doping in Sports/*prevention & controlMH  - GeorgiaMH  - HumansMH  - Mandatory Testing/*organization & administrationMH  - *SportsMH  - Sports Medicine/*organization & administrationMH  - *Substance Abuse DetectionEDAT- 1997/05/01MHDA- 1997/05/01 00:01CRDT- 1997/05/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Am J Health Syst Pharm. 1997 May 1;54(9):1053-7.PMID- 9113428OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19970625DCOM- 19970625LR  - 20061115IS  - 1050-642X (Print)IS  - 1050-642X (Linking)VI  - 7IP  - 2DP  - 1997 AprTI  - Sport-related hematuria: a review.PG  - 119-25AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present an overview and models of the potential causes and      implications of sport-related hematuria in an athletic population as provided by       a literature review. DATA SOURCES: A total of 64 published scientific articles      have been utilized to provide a review of sport-related hematuria. STUDY      SELECTION: Reviewed studies were selected on the basis that they provided      informative findings about the possible mechanisms of sport-related hematuria      attributed to exercise duration and intensity. These studies used both normal      adult and athletic populations. DATA EXTRACTION: A review of the literature on      the potential mechanisms of sport-related hematuria led to the classification of       these mechanisms as either exercise duration related or exercise intensity      related. DATA SYNTHESIS: Research has revealed an increased prevalence of      hematuria in athletes. The mechanisms responsible may be traced to different      sources or a combination thereof. Many explanations have been directed toward a      potential cause; foot-strike hemolysis, renal ischemia, hypoxic damage to the      kidney, the release of a hemolyzing factor, bladder and/or kidney trauma,      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, dehydration, increased circulation rate,      myoglobinuria release, and the peroxidation of red blood cells. These mechanisms       are presented in two models depicting the influence of either exercise intensity       or exercise duration on sport-related hematuria. CONCLUSIONS: Athletes, coaches,       and sports medicine professionals should be aware of this condition because      frequent high-intensity and/or long-duration workouts and competitions may      promote the symptoms. Repeated red blood cell loss through the urine may be a      contributing factor toward promoting anemic conditions in competitive athletes.      Recognition of the potential mechanisms can spare the time and expense of      invasive testing.FAU - Jones, G RAU  - Jones GRAD  - University of Western Ontario, London, Canada.FAU - Newhouse, IAU  - Newhouse ILA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Clin J Sport MedJT  - Clinical journal of sport medicine : official journal of the Canadian Academy of       Sport MedicineJID - 9103300SB  - IMMH  - Dehydration/complicationsMH  - Exercise/*physiologyMH  - Hematuria/epidemiology/*etiology/physiopathology/prevention & controlMH  - HumansMH  - Kidney/injuries/physiopathologyMH  - PrevalenceMH  - Sports/*physiologyMH  - Urinary Bladder/injuries/physiopathologyRF  - 64EDAT- 1997/04/01MHDA- 1997/04/01 00:01CRDT- 1997/04/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Clin J Sport Med. 1997 Apr;7(2):119-25.PMID- 9082176OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19970402DCOM- 19970402LR  - 20080214IS  - 0149-2195 (Print)IS  - 0149-2195 (Linking)VI  - 46IP  - 10DP  - 1997 Mar 14TI  - Sports-related recurrent brain injuries--United States.PG  - 224-7AB  - An estimated 300,000 sports-related traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) of mild to      moderate severity, most of which can be classified as concussions (i.e.,      conditions of temporarily altered mental status as a result of head trauma),      occur in the United States each year. The proportion of these concussions that      are repeat injuries is unknown; however, there is an increased risk for      subsequent TBI among persons who have had at least one previous TBI. Repeated      mild brain injuries occurring over an extended period (i.e., months or years) can      result in cumulative neurologic and cognitive deficits, but repeated mild brain      injuries occurring within a short period (i.e., hours, days, or weeks) can be      catastrophic or fatal. The latter phenomenon, termed "second impact syndrome",      has been reported more frequently since it was first characterized in 1984. This       report describes two cases of second impact syndrome and presents recommendations      developed by the American Academy of Neurology to prevent recurrent brain      injuries in sports and their adverse consequences.CN  - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)LA  - engPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - UNITED STATESTA  - MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly RepJT  - MMWR.

The literature       supports the notion that sport is a necessary study as a health issue and a      preventative tool in the field of psychiatry. Play and sport in childhood and      adolescence enhance development physically, mentally, and socially. Participating      in athletics encourages the development of leadership skills, self-esteem, muscle      development and overall physical health. There is a lack of literature in the      important area of sport psychiatry especially when considering beneficial, not      deficit oriented youth athletic development. Child psychiatrists need to begin      researching sport in order to develop a comprehensive understanding of how      athletics can enhance the mental and physical health of youth.FAU - Eppright, T DAU  - Eppright TDAD  - University of Missouri, Columbia, USA.FAU - Sanfacon, J AAU  - Sanfacon JAFAU - Beck, N CAU  - Beck NCFAU - Bradley, J SAU  - Bradley JSLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPT  - ReviewPL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Child Psychiatry Hum DevJT  - Child psychiatry and human developmentJID - 1275332SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - *Adolescent PsychiatryMH  - ChildMH  - Child Development/physiologyMH  - *Child PsychiatryMH  - Child, PreschoolMH  - FemaleMH  - Growth/physiologyMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Sex FactorsMH  - *SportsRF  - 60EDAT- 1997/01/01 00:00MHDA- 1998/03/12 00:01CRDT- 1997/01/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Child Psychiatry Hum Dev. 1997 Winter;28(2):71-88.PMID- 9062055OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19970408DCOM- 19970408LR  - 20081121IS  - 0022-4707 (Print)IS  - 0022-4707 (Linking)VI  - 36IP  - 4DP  - 1996 DecTI  - High-level athlete's impressions of their preparticipation sports examination.PG  - 291-2AB  - OBJECTIVE: To document the high-level athletes' impressions of their      preparticipation examination (PE). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Prospective study by      self-reporting questionnaire. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: One hundred-fifty French       athletes, involved in national or international-level events (PE is obligatory      every year in France). Response rate obtained was 71%. Subject population      consisted of 107 normal, healthy, elite athletes, ranging in age from 16 to 31      years (mean 22.4 years), included 69 males and 38 females. MEASURES: Knowledge      and impression of PE, based upon the athletes' own experience. All of the      consulted physician were trained and qualified in sports medicine. RESULTS:      Thirty-six percent of the athletes reported having had bad-quality      preparticipation sports visit (no significant difference between gender or age).       According to them, medical history taking was "poor", and physical examination      "restricted to blood pressure measurement" and/or "chest listening" and "not      targeted enough on past athletic injuries". Athletes said PE should especially      evaluate the cardiovascular system (75% of all citations to the item), the      musculoskeletal system (16%) and the lungs (8%), and should involve an      electrocardiogram (41%). CONCLUSIONS: Challenges for the future: 1) better      educate physician in sport, to improve the preventive aspects of sports medicine       2) physicians should provide information to coaches and athletes concerning the      optimal balance between health and physical performance, and therefore to the      interest of PE.FAU - Laure, PAU  - Laure PLA  - engPT  - LetterPL  - ITALYTA  - J Sports Med Phys FitnessJT  - The Journal of sports medicine and physical fitnessJID - 0376337SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - Athletic Injuries/diagnosis/prevention & controlMH  - *Attitude to HealthMH  - Blood Pressure DeterminationMH  - Cardiovascular Physiological PhenomenaMH  - ElectrocardiographyMH  - FemaleMH  - FranceMH  - Heart AuscultationMH  - HumansMH  - Lung/physiologyMH  - MaleMH  - Medical History TakingMH  - Musculoskeletal Physiological PhenomenaMH  - *Physical ExaminationMH  - Prospective StudiesMH  - Psychomotor Performance/physiologyMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Sports/*psychologyMH  - Sports Medicine/educationEDAT- 1996/12/01MHDA- 1996/12/01 00:01CRDT- 1996/12/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Med Phys Fitness. 1996 Dec;36(4):291-2.PMID- 9017755OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19970430DCOM- 19970430LR  - 20041117IS  - 0031-5125 (Print)IS  - 0031-5125 (Linking)VI  - 83IP  - 3 Pt 2DP  - 1996 DecTI  - Effects of mental practice on performance are moderated by cognitive anxiety as      measured by the Sport Competition Anxiety Test.PG  - 1375-83AB  - 45 subjects were assessed for cognitive anxiety on the Sport Competition Anxiety       Test. Two months later they observed a person performing a new motor task which      required high cognitive processing to be performed well. After this observation,       22 subjects were randomly assigned to a Mental Practice and 23 to a Control      group. The former performed a cognitive rehearsal of the task, whereas the latter      did not. None practiced the task physically before being tested. Analysis of      variance showed that both errors and performance time interacted significantly      with Mental Practice versus Control group scores and scores on the Sport      Competition Anxiety Test. Among subjects who practiced mentally, those scoring      low on cognitive anxiety performed significantly better than subjects who scored       high. Further, the relationship between test scores of cognitive anxiety and      performance for the total sample was analysed by different curvilinear regression      models. The cubic model fitted the data better and accounted for a greater      percent of variance on error performance explained by anxiety test scores (R =      .39) than the linear correlation (r = .25). This cubic model formed a polynomial       relationship between cognitive anxiety test scores and error in performance.FAU - Halvari, HAU  - Halvari HAD  - Buskerud College, Department for Finance and Administration, Honefoss, Norway.LA  - engPT  - Clinical TrialPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Randomized Controlled TrialPL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Percept Mot SkillsJT  - Perceptual and motor skillsJID - 0401131SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Anxiety/*psychologyMH  - *Competitive BehaviorMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - *ImaginationMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Personality InventoryMH  - *Practice (Psychology)MH  - Sports/*psychologyEDAT- 1996/12/01MHDA- 1996/12/01 00:01CRDT- 1996/12/01 00:00AID - 10.2466/pms.1996.83.3f.1375 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Percept Mot Skills. 1996 Dec;83(3 Pt 2):1375-83.PMID- 10158969OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19960820DCOM- 19960820LR  - 20041117IS  - 0160-7480 (Print)IS  - 0160-7480 (Linking)VI  - 26IP  - 32DP  - 1996 Aug 5TI  - Execs should meditate on Bulls coach's practices.PG  - 116, 118FAU - Peterson, KAU  - Peterson KLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Mod HealthcJT  - Modern healthcareJID - 7801798SB  - HMH  - *EmpathyMH  - HumansMH  - *Organizational CultureMH  - Organizational InnovationMH  - Personnel Management/*methodsMH  - *SportsMH  - United StatesEDAT- 1996/08/05 00:00MHDA- 1999/04/02 00:01CRDT- 1996/08/05 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Mod Healthc. 1996 Aug 5;26(32):116, 118.PMID- 8776685OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19961115DCOM- 19961115LR  - 20071115IS  - 0096-882X (Print)IS  - 0096-882X (Linking)VI  - 57IP  - 4DP  - 1996 JulTI  - Male adolescents' reactions to TV beer advertisements: the effects of sports      content and programming context.PG  - 425-33AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examines white male adolescent responses to TV beer      advertisements with and without sports content and to nonbeer ads when embedded      in sports and entertainment programming. METHOD: A total of 72 advertisements and      24 television program excerpts were randomly sampled from national television      programming. White male adolescents (N = 157) recruited in a public school system      each viewed six ads (one of each of three types of ad embedded in each of two      types of programming) comprising the 2 x 2 x 3 factorial, within-subjects,      mixed-model (random and fixed effects) experimental design along with an      age-level blocking factor and random factors for commercial and program stimuli.       Cognitive responses to each ad were content-analyzed. Individual difference      variables including alcohol use behavior, sensation-seeking, masculinity and      sports involvement were also measured. RESULTS: Subjects showed a consistent      preference for beer ads with sports content. A significant three-way interaction       between ad type, programming type and junior versus senior high-school age level       also indicated that sports programming had an inconsistent effect on responses to      beer ads but that nonbeer ads were responded to more positively during sports      than during entertainment programming. Other analyses showed that subjects were      more cognitively resistant to beer ads than to nonbeer ads. CONCLUSIONS: These      results support public and official concerns that sports content in beer ads      increase the ads appeal to underage youth. They do not support hypothesized      concerns that sports programming might prime adolescents to be more receptive to       beer ads.

Our study       assessed the association between extent of participation in regular sport or      vigorous recreational activity and emotional wellbeing in adolescents aged 16      years. METHODS: Data were collected from a cohort of adolescents, born between      April 5 and April 11, 1970, in England, Scotland, and Wales, who took part in the      follow-up assessment at age 16 years. Emotional wellbeing was assessed by the      general health questionnaire (GHQ) and the malaise inventory (divided into      psychological and somatic subscales). Information was obtained about      participation in ten team and 25 individual sports and vigorous recreational      activities during the previous year. Non-vigorous recreations, such as darts and       snooker, were assessed separately. Social class and health status (recent illness      and use of hospital services) were included in our analyses as possible      confounding factors. 2223 boys and 2838 girls with a mean age of 16.3 years (SD      0.38) were included in our analysis. Statistical analysis was by multiple linear       and logistic regression. FINDINGS: The sport and vigorous recreational activity      index was positively associated with emotional wellbeing independently of sex,      social class, health status, and use of hospital services. These associations      were significant for the psychological symptom subscale of the malaise inventory       (regression coefficient -0.024, 95 percent Cl -0.036 to -0.011, p<0.001) and the       GHQ (odds ratio of emotional distress per unit increase in vigorous physical      activity 0.992, 95 percent Cl 0.985-0.998, p<O.O1). By contrast, participation in      non-vigorous activities was associated with high psychological and somatic      symptoms on the malaise inventory. INTERPRETATION: We conclude that emotional      wellbeing is positively associated with extent of participation in sport and      vigorous recreational activity among adolescents. Although causal associations      cannot be assumed in this cross-sectional analysis, our results are consistent      with experimental evidence that vigorous exercise has favourable effects on      emotional state.FAU - Steptoe, AAU  - Steptoe AAD  - Department of Psychology, St George's Hospital Medical School, University of      London, UK.FAU - Butler, NAU  - Butler NLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - ENGLANDTA  - LancetJT  - LancetJID - 2985213RSB  - AIMSB  - IMCIN - Lancet. 1996 Aug 17;348(9025):477.

Weight loss in wrestlers.PG  - ix-xiiAB  - Despite a growing body of evidence admonishing the behavior, weight cutting      (rapid weight reduction) remains prevalent among wrestlers. Weight cutting has      significant adverse consequences that may affect competitive performance,      physical health, and normal growth and development. To enhance the education      experience and reduce the health risks for the participants, the ACSM recommends       measures to educate coaches and wrestlers toward sound nutrition and weight      control behaviors, to curtail "weight cutting," and to enact rules that limit      weight loss.FAU - Oppliger, R AAU  - Oppliger RAFAU - Case, H SAU  - Case HSFAU - Horswill, C AAU  - Horswill CAFAU - Landry, G LAU  - Landry GLFAU - Shelter, A CAU  - Shelter ACLA  - engPT  - GuidelinePT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Practice GuidelinePT  - ReviewPL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Med Sci Sports ExercJT  - Medicine and science in sports and exerciseJID - 8005433SB  - IMSB  - SMH  - HumansMH  - *Weight Loss/physiologyMH  - Wrestling/*physiologyRF  - 72EDAT- 1996/06/01MHDA- 1996/06/01 00:01CRDT- 1996/06/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Med Sci Sports Exerc. 1996 Jun;28(6):ix-xii.PMID- 8744784OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19961104DCOM- 19961104LR  - 20081121IS  - 1050-1606 (Print)IS  - 1050-1606 (Linking)VI  - 6IP  - 2DP  - 1996 JunTI  - Working with young athletes: views of a nutritionist on the sports medicine team.PG  - 110-20AB  - Athletes are influenced by coaches, other athletes, media, parents, the national       sport governing body, members of the sports medicine team, and the athlete's own       desire for success. It is impossible, therefore, for one member of the sports      medicine team to unilaterally determine workable solutions that enhance      performance and diminish health problems in an athlete. A focus on ensuring that       the athlete can perform to the best of her ability is a key to encouraging      discussion between the nutritionist, athlete, and coach. Using the assumption      that health and top athletic performance are compatible, this focus on      performance provides a discussion point that all parties can agree to and, if      approached properly, also fulfills the nutritionist's goal of achieving optimal      nutritional status. Membership on the sports medicine team mandates that the      nutritionist know the paradigms and health risks associated with the sport and      develop assessment and feedback procedures specific to the athlete's needs.FAU - Benardot, DAU  - Benardot DAD  - Laboratory for Elite Athlete Performance, Center for Sports Medicine and Sport      Sciences, Georgia State University, Atlanta 30303, USA.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Int J Sport NutrJT  - International journal of sport nutritionJID - 9307702SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Body CompositionMH  - Data CollectionMH  - DietMH  - Energy IntakeMH  - FemaleMH  - *Gymnastics/physiologyMH  - HumansMH  - *Nutritional Physiological PhenomenaMH  - *Sports MedicineEDAT- 1996/06/01MHDA- 1996/06/01 00:01CRDT- 1996/06/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Int J Sport Nutr. 1996 Jun;6(2):110-20.PMID- 8693184OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19960826DCOM- 19960826LR  - 20061115IS  - 0034-3536 (Print)IS  - 0034-3536 (Linking)VI  - 35IP  - 1DP  - 1996 FebTI  - [Sports therapy and rehabilitation sports--a health policy responsibility of      rehabilitation].PG  - 23-8AB  - From a demographic and health policy perspective, movement and sports are gaining      increased importance in terms of their preventive, therapeutic and rehabilitative      potential. Successful use of sports therapy and rehabilitation sports in      rehabilitating paraplegics, breast cancer patients, and patients with total hip      replacement have provided convincing proof of their positive physical, mental and      social impact, hence of the substantial contributions they are able to make      towards enhancing specific parameters of the quality of life. It is assumed that       movement and sports are conducive in particular in chronic conditions, in line      with the principle of "rehabilitation taking priority over care". Whether reduced      health care spending will ensue, will in the final analysis have to be determined      through controlled longitudinal studies, which have not been embarked upon as      yet. Successful rehabilitation in this domain presupposes adequately qualified      staffing in movement therapy-focussed rehabilitation facilities, both in- and      out-patient, availability of an uninterrupted rehabilitation chain as well as      appropriate follow-up for evaluation.FAU - Schule, KAU  - Schule KAD  - Institut fur Rehabilitation und Behindertensport Deutsche Sporthochschule Koln.LA  - gerPT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticleTT  - Sporttherapie und Rehabilitationssport--eine gesundheitspolitische Aufgabe der      Rehabilitation.PL  - GERMANYTA  - Rehabilitation (Stuttg)JT  - Die RehabilitationJID - 0401273SB  - IMMH  - Activities of Daily Living/classification/psychologyMH  - Adaptation, PsychologicalMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Breast Neoplasms/psychology/rehabilitationMH  - *Disabled Persons/psychologyMH  - *Exercise TherapyMH  - FemaleMH  - *Health PolicyMH  - Hip Prosthesis/psychology/rehabilitationMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Paraplegia/psychology/rehabilitationMH  - Physical Therapy ModalitiesMH  - Quality of LifeMH  - Rehabilitation, VocationalMH  - Sick RoleMH  - *SportsMH  - Treatment OutcomeEDAT- 1996/02/01MHDA- 1996/02/01 00:01CRDT- 1996/02/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Rehabilitation (Stuttg). 1996 Feb;35(1):23-8.PMID- 8814807OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19961004DCOM- 19961004LR  - 20061115IS  - 1569-2574 (Print)IS  - 1569-2574 (Linking)VI  - 5DP  - 1996TI  - Similarities between sustained sport performance and behavior in extended      spaceflights.PG  - 331-9AB  - Extended spaceflights seem to be similar to lengthy sport trials, in which top      athletes are stressed by confinement and are still asked to maintain a high level      of performance, staving off fatigue and performance decrements. The athletes use       coping strategies and recovery techniques in order to compensate for unexpected      workoverload during sustained operation. Astronauts probably experience similar      conditions, and they may use similar coping strategies and recovery techniques.      Since sustained and continuous operation preferably affects the mental      capabilities required for complex tasks, particular attention should be paid to      decrements of mental and psychological performance and to techniques that could      be used specifically for the recovery of a satisfactory level of performance.FAU - Gillot, GAU  - Gillot GAD  - Research Center on Sport Performance, University of Dijon, France.FAU - Kane-Toure, NAU  - Kane-Toure NFAU - Mahiddine, SAU  - Mahiddine SLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Adv Space Biol MedJT  - Advances in space biology and medicineJID - 9316462SB  - IMSB  - SMH  - AstronautsMH  - HumansMH  - *Space FlightMH  - *SportsMH  - Time FactorsEDAT- 1996/01/01MHDA- 1996/01/01 00:01CRDT- 1996/01/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Adv Space Biol Med. 1996;5:331-9.PMID- 16558357OWN - NLMSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINEDA  - 20100629DCOM- 20100629LR  - 20100915IS  - 1062-6050 (Print)IS  - 1062-6050 (Linking)VI  - 30IP  - 4DP  - 1995 OctTI  - The performance enhancement group program: integrating sport psychology and      rehabilitation.PG  - 328-31AB  - In an effort to improve the psychological health of the athlete who has sustained      an injury, the Performance Enhancement Group program for injured athletes was      created.

The purpose of       this paper is to investigate the physiological response of elite badminton      players in a sport-specific fitness test. Twelve Hong Kong national badminton      team players performed a field test on a badminton court. Six light bulbs were      connected to a programming device causing individual bulbs to light up in a given      sequence. The players were instructed to react to the flashes by running towards       them, and striking shuttles mounted in the vicinity of the bulbs. Exercise      intensity was controlled by altering the interval between successive lightings. A      low correlation (r = 0.65) was found between the results of the field test and      the rank-order list of subjects, based on an objective on-field physiological      assessment and subjective ranking. This may be explained by the requirements of      other factors besides physical fitness which contribute to success in elite level      badminton competition. These factors may include, for example, technical skill,      mental power, and aesthetic judgements on the court. Maximum mean (s.d.) heart      rate data (187(8) beats.min-1) and blood lactate values (10.4(2.9) mmol.l-1) in      this study showed that players were under maximal load during the field test.      From the testing data, it seems reasonable to speculate that the intensity of      level 3 (20 light pulses.min-1; 3.0 s.pulse-1) and level 4 (22 light      pulses.min-1; 2.7 s.pulse-1) simulates the requirement of actual games energy      expenditure of the Hong Kong badminton players exercising at close to their      anaerobic threshold. The results also show that an estimate of fitness can be      derived from measurements involving exercise closely resembling that which is      specific for the sports activity in question. Improved training advice and      guidance may result from such studies.FAU - Chin, M KAU  - Chin MKAD  - Sports Science Department, Hong Kong Sports Institute, Shatin.FAU - Wong, A SAU  - Wong ASFAU - So, R CAU  - So RCFAU - Siu, O TAU  - Siu OTFAU - Steininger, KAU  - Steininger KFAU - Lo, D TAU  - Lo DTLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - ENGLANDTA  - Br J Sports MedJT  - British journal of sports medicineJID - 0432520RN  - 0 (Lactates)SB  - IMSB  - SMH  - AdultMH  - Anaerobic ThresholdMH  - Energy MetabolismMH  - EstheticsMH  - Exercise Test/*methodsMH  - FemaleMH  - Heart RateMH  - Hong KongMH  - HumansMH  - JudgmentMH  - Lactates/bloodMH  - MaleMH  - Mental ProcessesMH  - Motor SkillsMH  - Physical Education and TrainingMH  - *Physical FitnessMH  - Psychomotor PerformanceMH  - Racquet Sports/*physiologyMH  - Running/physiologyPMC - PMC1332304OID - NLM: PMC1332304EDAT- 1995/09/01MHDA- 1995/09/01 00:01CRDT- 1995/09/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Br J Sports Med. 1995 Sep;29(3):153-7.PMID- 7630840OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19950906DCOM- 19950906LR  - 20111117IS  - 0032-5481 (Print)IS  - 0032-5481 (Linking)VI  - 98IP  - 2DP  - 1995 AugTI  - Preparticipation sports examinations.

The goal of the examining physician is to determine      whether the athlete is mentally, developmentally, and physically capable of      safely competing in recreational and competitive sports. We recommend that      examinations precede the start of an activity by 4 to 6 weeks and be done every 3      years. History taking should include parental input and a private interview with       the athlete when possible. The specific areas of the body to be used in a      particular sport should be emphasized in the physical examination, and the amount      of contact and energy required should be considered. Abnormal findings should be       thoroughly evaluated to rule out risk of injury or sudden death before approval      to participate is granted.FAU - Bratton, R LAU  - Bratton RLAD  - Division of Family Medicine, Mayo Clinic Jacksonville, Florida, USA.FAU - Agerter, D CAU  - Agerter DCLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Postgrad MedJT  - Postgraduate medicineJID - 0401147SB  - AIMSB  - IMCIN - Postgrad Med. 1995 Nov;98(5):14.

Officials from the North Carolina university said the      instructor, known as John Doe, posed a direct threat to students and himself. The      Equal Employment Opportunities Commission (EEOC) sued in April 1994 on Doe's      behalf, saying the university violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).      Doe's attorney also charged the university with violating the Rehabilitation Act       and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). According to EEOC      officials, the university decided to settle after learning that medical experts      were prepared to testify that Doe could perform his job without endangering      anyone. As part of the settlement, Doe will return to the payroll, but at a new      job which he developed. In addition, the university agreed to keep confidential      the medical information of its employees, purge Doe's personnel file of any      references to his medical condition or the discrimination complaint, and provide       AIDS awareness and sensitivity training to university managers and supervisors.OABL- engEDAT- 1995/05/05 00:00MHDA- 2001/05/22 10:01CRDT- 1995/05/05 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - AIDS Policy Law. 1995 May 5;10(8):1, 11.PMID- 7825765OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19950216DCOM- 19950216LR  - 20081121IS  - 0003-4819 (Print)IS  - 0003-4819 (Linking)VI  - 122IP  - 4DP  - 1995 Feb 15TI  - Transmission of blood-borne pathogens during sports: risk and prevention.PG  - 283-5AB  - Publicity about human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in athletes has      focused attention on the potential for transmission of blood-borne pathogens      during sports and athletic competitions.

Although previous developmental work in this area had      examined a number of intra- and interpersonal variables thought to influence      children's motivational orientation, few studies have tested an integrated model.      Questionnaires assessing perceived competence, perceived control, competitive      trait anxiety, and motivational orientation were completed by 108 boys.      Additionally, 12 coaches were observed for two games in order to record coaching       behaviors during competition. The model tested demonstrated an excellent fit of      data. In particular, the model showed that both coaching behaviors and children's      trait anxiety causally influenced perception of control.

Active-alert      hypnosis is induced before or during practice whereas traditional hypnosis is      induced after practice to establish connections between the two experiences. The       fundamental goals are to (a) develop mental skills important to both motor and      hypnotic performance, (b) supply a wide range of motor and hypnotic bodily      experiences important to performance, and (c) induce alert hypnosis before or      during performance. The model is based on the assumption that hypnosis and motor       performance share common skills modifiable through training. Similarities between      hypnosis and peak performance in the model are also considered.

The model      hypothesized that personal/situational variables of coaching issues, social      support, hardiness, gender, and win/loss record predict stress appraisal which,      in turn, predicts burnout. A preliminary gender by time of season repeated      measures analysis indicated significant main effects for gender and time.

In an attempt to determine if      tenets of ZOF theory held for athletes in a team sport, anxiety was measured      using Spielberger's state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) at the baseline and      before easy and difficult competitions in nine members of a collegiate women's      volleyball team. The ability to predict precompetition anxiety was assessed by      having the athletes complete the STAI both 3 weeks and 2 days before each match      according to how they thought they would feel 1 h before competition. Each      athlete also completed the STAI on the basis of how she recalled feeling before      her best competition. Four anxiety units were added and subtracted from this      value to establish the ZOF of each player. Actual precompetition anxiety was      assessed 1 h before each match. In accordance with ZOF theory, considerable      variability was found in the range of optimal anxiety, and 55.5% of the team      members reported performing best at either low or high levels of anxiety. The      prediction of precompetition anxiety made 2 days before competition was      significantly correlated to actual anxiety for the difficult match (r = 0.69, P <      0.05) but not the easy match (r = 0.21, P > 0.05). Predictions made 3 weeks      before competition were not significant (P > 0.05). More (P < 0.05) of the player      possessed anxiety levels within the ZOF for the difficult match compared with the      easy match (77.7% versus 22.2%). In summary, athletes in the team sport of      volleyball exhibit considerable variation in optimal precompetition anxiety in      accordance with ZOF theory. As posited by ZOF theory, the athletes were able to      predict anxiety before a difficult match accurately and were more likely to have       anxiety levels with ZOF.FAU - Raglin, J SAU  - Raglin JSAD  - Indiana University, Department of Kinesiology, Bloomington 47405.FAU - Morris, M JAU  - Morris MJLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - ENGLANDTA  - Br J Sports MedJT  - British journal of sports medicineJID - 0432520SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - Anxiety/physiopathology/*psychologyMH  - AttitudeMH  - FemaleMH  - Follow-Up StudiesMH  - ForecastingMH  - HumansMH  - Mental RecallMH  - Personality InventoryMH  - Psychomotor Performance/*physiologyMH  - Self ConceptMH  - Sports/physiology/*psychologyPMC - PMC1332158OID - NLM: PMC1332158EDAT- 1994/03/01MHDA- 1994/03/01 00:01CRDT- 1994/03/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Br J Sports Med. 1994 Mar;28(1):47-51.PMID- 8205179OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19940712DCOM- 19940712LR  - 20051116IS  - 1040-8703 (Print)IS  - 1040-8703 (Linking)VI  - 6IP  - 1DP  - 1994 FebTI  - Sports injuries in children.PG  - 80-4AB  - More children are participating in organized sports than ever before. Although      improved coaching, equipment, officiating, and rules have been implemented to      reduce injuries, a significant number of young athletes continue to be injured.      Fortunately, most injuries sustained by young athletes are minor requiring only      symptomatic treatment. However, because of the unique features of the immature      skeleton, particularly the presence of open physes, these injuries can      nonetheless result in permanent alteration of bone growth with long-term      morbidity and disability. Furthermore, the prognosis and natural history of      sports injuries in children may be different than that for similar injuries in      adults. It is important that the practitioner dealing with young athletes be      aware of the unique features of children's sports injuries so that proper      treatment may be initiated and prognosis and expected outcome may be      intelligently discussed with the patient and parents.

From this study most sports      injuries in children appears benign even if some fractures led to hospitalisation      and orthopedic surgery; this is possibly related to the quality of education and       coaching, particularly during physical training at school.FAU - Velin, PAU  - Velin PAD  - Service des urgences, hopital Lenval pour Enfants, Nice, France.FAU - Four, RAU  - Four RFAU - Matta, TAU  - Matta TFAU - Dupont, DAU  - Dupont DLA  - frePT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticleTT  - Evaluation des traumatismes sportifs de l'enfant et de l'adolescent.PL  - FRANCETA  - Arch PediatrJT  - Archives de pediatrie : organe officiel de la Societe francaise de pediatrieJID - 9421356SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Age FactorsMH  - Athletic Injuries/*epidemiologyMH  - ChildMH  - Emergency Service, Hospital/statistics & numerical dataMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Prospective StudiesEDAT- 1994/02/01MHDA- 2000/05/05 09:00CRDT- 1994/02/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Arch Pediatr. 1994 Feb;1(2):202-7.PMID- 8112282OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19940331DCOM- 19940331LR  - 20051116IS  - 0014-0139 (Print)IS  - 0014-0139 (Linking)VI  - 37IP  - 1DP  - 1994 JanTI  - The learning of motor skills: sports science and ergonomics perspectives.PG  - 5-16AB  - The paper describes some of the common origins of ergonomics and sports science      in the UK with particular reference to research on motor learning. Attention is      drawn to the value of analytical methods developed by ergonomists in deriving      training prescriptions and their relationship with conventional learning theory      is discussed. The cognitive revolution, which in the last 25 years has changed      the face of psychology, has also had its impact on ergonomics and basic research       on motor skills. The role of cognitive processes in motor learning is being      reassessed and there is a renewed interest in topics such as verbal instruction,       imitation, imagery, and mental practice which to earlier generations of      behavioural scientists appeared beyond the scope of scientific investigation. The      paper outlines some recent research into the role of imagery in motor learning      illustrating these new approaches.FAU - Annett, JAU  - Annett JAD  - Department of Psychology, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - ENGLANDTA  - ErgonomicsJT  - ErgonomicsJID - 0373220SB  - IMSB  - SMH  - AttentionMH  - CommunicationMH  - *Human EngineeringMH  - HumansMH  - Knowledge of Results (Psychology)MH  - Mental RecallMH  - *Motor SkillsMH  - Physical Education and TrainingMH  - *SportsRF  - 50EDAT- 1994/01/01MHDA- 1994/01/01 00:01CRDT- 1994/01/01 00:00AID - 10.1080/00140139408963617 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Ergonomics. 1994 Jan;37(1):5-16.PMID- 7497925OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19960116DCOM- 19960116LR  - 20041117IS  - 0012-7183 (Print)IS  - 0012-7183 (Linking)VI  - 110IP  - 12DP  - 1994TI  - [Does professional sports need psychiatry?].PG  - 1178-81FAU - Huttunen, M OAU  - Huttunen MOFAU - Huttunen, MAU  - Huttunen MLA  - finPT  - EditorialTT  - Tarvitseeko huippu-urheilu psykiatria?PL  - FINLANDTA  - DuodecimJT  - Duodecim; laaketieteellinen aikakauskirjaJID - 0373207SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - ChildMH  - Doping in SportsMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Mental Disorders/therapyMH  - Social BehaviorMH  - Sports/*psychologyMH  - *Sports MedicineEDAT- 1994/01/01MHDA- 1994/01/01 00:01CRDT- 1994/01/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Duodecim. 1994;110(12):1178-81.PMID- 8035585OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19940812DCOM- 19940812LR  - 20061115IS  - 0022-4707 (Print)IS  - 0022-4707 (Linking)VI  - 33IP  - 4DP  - 1993 DecTI  - Predictors of attainment in rhythmic sportive gymnastics.PG  - 367-77AB  - Correlates of attainment in rhythmic sportive gymnastics (RSG) were investigated       in a cross-sectional study of 106 female gymnasts aged 7-27 years. Physical      attributes were obtained by anthropometry and from tests of flexibility, leg      power, maximum oxygen uptake and visuo-motor proficiency. Training and      psychological measures were derived from self-administered questionnaires that      included the Leadership Scale for Sport, Psychological Skills Inventory for      Sport, General Health Questionnaire, Sport Competition Anxiety Test, and several       questions on sport motivation and enjoyment. Attainment was expressed as      competition grade level and mean performance score in 4 competitions. The best      correlates of attainment were cumulative and current training time (r =      0.84-0.53). Age, lean body mass and composite measures of flexibility, leg power       and visuo-motor proficiency were also significant correlates of attainment (r =      0.69-0.29), as were coach democratic and coach social behaviours (r = 0.41-0.28).      The significant positive psychometric correlates of attainment were mental      preparation, motivation by creativity, and several dimensions of enjoyment (r =      0.35-0.26); significant negative correlates were recent anxiety-depression and      enjoyment of training (r = -0.34-(-)0.32). No previous study has identified the      relative contributions of such a comprehensive range of physical, psychological      and training measures to performance of a sport.FAU - Hume, P AAU  - Hume PAAD  - School of Physical Education, University of Otago, New Zealand.FAU - Hopkins, W GAU  - Hopkins WGFAU - Robinson, D MAU  - Robinson DMFAU - Robinson, S MAU  - Robinson SMFAU - Hollings, S CAU  - Hollings SCLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - ITALYTA  - J Sports Med Phys FitnessJT  - The Journal of sports medicine and physical fitnessJID - 0376337SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - ChildMH  - FemaleMH  - *Gymnastics/physiology/psychologyMH  - HumansEDAT- 1993/12/01MHDA- 1993/12/01 00:01CRDT- 1993/12/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Med Phys Fitness. 1993 Dec;33(4):367-77.PMID- 8233953OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19931210DCOM- 19931210LR  - 20041117IS  - 0954-7762 (Print)IS  - 0954-7762 (Linking)VI  - 89IP  - 43DP  - 1993 Oct 27-Nov 2TI  - Mental health: sporting chances.PG  - 62-3FAU - Bell, RAU  - Bell RFAU - Cooney, MAU  - Cooney MLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - ENGLANDTA  - Nurs TimesJT  - Nursing timesJID - 0423236SB  - NMH  - AdultMH  - HumansMH  - Leisure ActivitiesMH  - MaleMH  - Mental Disorders/rehabilitationMH  - Psychiatric NursingMH  - *SportsEDAT- 1993/10/02MHDA- 1993/10/02 00:01CRDT- 1993/10/02 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Nurs Times. 1993 Oct 27-Nov 2;89(43):62-3.PMID- 8595582OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19960416DCOM- 19960416LR  - 20051116IS  - 0894-1009 (Print)IS  - 0894-1009 (Linking)VI  - 14IP  - 9DP  - 1993 SepTI  - Prevention and emergency first-aid treatment for sports-related dentofacial      injuries.PG  - 1142, 1144-6 passim; quiz 1156AB  - Every day, thousands of athletes participate in sports that are conducive to      injuries of the head and face structures.

Eight baseball coaches attended a preseason workshop       designed to increase their supportiveness and instructional effectiveness.      Behavioral guidelines were presented and modeled. A no-treatment control group      had 10 coaches. Boys (N = 152) in both groups were interviewed pre- and      postseason. Trained coaches differed from controls in player-perceived behaviors       in accordance with the guidelines. They were evaluated more positively by their      players, their players had more fun, and their teams exhibited a higher level of       attraction among players, despite the fact that their teams did not differ from      controls in won-lost records. Consistent with a self-esteem enhancement model,      findings showed that boys with low self-esteem who played for the trained coaches      exhibited significant increases in general self-esteem; low self-esteem      youngsters in the control group did not.FAU - Smoll, F LAU  - Smoll FLAD  - Department of Psychology, University of Washington, Seattle 98195.FAU - Smith, R EAU  - Smith REFAU - Barnett, N PAU  - Barnett NPFAU - Everett, J JAU  - Everett JJLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - UNITED STATESTA  - J Appl PsycholJT  - The Journal of applied psychologyJID - 0222526SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Baseball/*psychologyMH  - ChildMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - *Personality DevelopmentMH  - *Self ConceptMH  - *Social SupportEDAT- 1993/08/01MHDA- 1993/08/01 00:01CRDT- 1993/08/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Appl Psychol. 1993 Aug;78(4):602-10.PMID- 8371648OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19931014DCOM- 19931014LR  - 20041117IS  - 0195-9131 (Print)IS  - 0195-9131 (Linking)VI  - 25IP  - 8DP  - 1993 AugTI  - J.

Questionnaire data from 235      secondary school athletes were analyzed using linear structural relations to test      a model of accountability hypothesized as operating in these coaching settings.      The accountability strategy of active instruction was found to be a variable that      significantly affected the students' valuing of their coaches as well as their      task involvement. However, the rewards/consequences variable was not found to be       a predictor of valuing or task involvement, suggesting that these athletes seemed      more task oriented than reliant on external sanctions. The results of this study       can only be generalized to team sport settings. Detailed examination needs to be       made of the processes through which accountability factors operate for other      contexts, including individual sports and competitive levels. Further research      could also be undertaken into gender differences, especially in relation to the      gender of coaches.FAU - Hastie, P AAU  - Hastie PAAD  - Department of Human Movement Studies, University of Queensland, Australia.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Res Q Exerc SportJT  - Research quarterly for exercise and sportJID - 8006373SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - LearningMH  - MaleMH  - MotivationMH  - *PerceptionMH  - *Physical Education and TrainingMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - RewardMH  - SchoolsMH  - Sports/*education/psychologyEDAT- 1993/06/01MHDA- 1993/06/01 00:01CRDT- 1993/06/01 00:00AID - 10.1080/02701367.1993.10608793 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Res Q Exerc Sport. 1993 Jun;64(2):158-66.PMID- 8336357OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19930826DCOM- 19930826LR  - 20081121IS  - 0264-0414 (Print)IS  - 0264-0414 (Linking)VI  - 11IP  - 3DP  - 1993 JunTI  - Participation in community sports centres: motives and predictors of enjoyment.PG  - 249-56AB  - Research into why people engage in sport and physical recreation has received      relatively little attention in both recreation planning and sport psychology.      Although there has been a steady flow of North American literature related to      participation motivation in competitive youth sport settings, such evidence is of      limited value in explaining adult involvement in sport and recreation in Britain.      The purpose of this exploratory study was to determine why people participate in       sport and exercise in community sports centres and to identify whether these      motives predict sport enjoyment. The study was based on a questionnaire-interview      of approximately 5 min duration conducted in six community sports centres in      Leicester. The sample comprised 336 respondents aged 16 years and over. The      subjects were presented with 15 motives for sports participation and indicated      their degree of agreement on a 5-point scale. The three most commonly endorsed      motives were to maintain health, develop physical fitness and aid relaxation. A      factor analysis with oblique rotation revealed four factors:assertive      achievement, physical well-being, socio-psychological well-being, and sports      mastery and performance. Discriminant analysis showed that males were more      motivated to participate for sports mastery and performance and assertive      achievement than females. A MANOVA showed that older subjects were more motivated      by socio-psychological well-being than younger subjects. Sport enjoyment was best      predicted by socio-psychological well-being, sports mastery and performance, and       sports importance, although only 14.4% of the variance in enjoyment scores was      accounted for. These results confirm other research on age differences in      exercise and mental health, as well as gender differences on participation      motives.FAU - Ashford, BAU  - Ashford BAD  - Division of Sport, Health and Exercise, Staffordshire University, Stoke-on-Trent,      UK.FAU - Biddle, SAU  - Biddle SFAU - Goudas, MAU  - Goudas MLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - ENGLANDTA  - J Sports SciJT  - Journal of sports sciencesJID - 8405364SB  - IMMH  - AchievementMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - Age FactorsMH  - AgedMH  - AssertivenessMH  - *AttitudeMH  - Attitude to HealthMH  - FemaleMH  - ForecastingMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - *MotivationMH  - Motor SkillsMH  - Physical FitnessMH  - Self ConceptMH  - Sex FactorsMH  - Sports/*psychologyMH  - Stress, Physiological/prevention & controlEDAT- 1993/06/01MHDA- 1993/06/01 00:01CRDT- 1993/06/01 00:00AID - 10.1080/02640419308729992 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Sci. 1993 Jun;11(3):249-56.PMID- 8497553OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19930624DCOM- 19930624LR  - 20091111IS  - 0048-5772 (Print)IS  - 0048-5772 (Linking)VI  - 30IP  - 3DP  - 1993 MayTI  - Cardiovascular activity during mental stress following vigorous exercise in      sportsmen and inactive men.PG  - 245-52AB  - Thirty-six competitive sportsmen and 36 inactive men participated in a      two-session experiment. Session 1 involved exercise to exhaustion so as to assess      maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max). In Session 2, both groups were randomized      into three experimental conditions: 20 min of exercise at high intensity (70%      VO2max) or moderate intensity (50% VO2max) or a light exercise control. Following      30 min of recovery, all subjects performed mental arithmetic and public speech      tasks in a counterbalanced order. Cardiovascular, electrodermal, respiratory, and      subjective variables were recorded. Sportsmen had higher VO2max, lower body fat,       and lower resting heart rate (HR) than inactive men. A postexercise hypotensive      response was observed among subjects in the 70% and 50% VO2max conditions,      accompanied by baroreceptor reflex inhibition in the 70% condition. Systolic      pressure was lower during mental arithmetic and during recovery from the speech      task in the high-intensity than in the control group. Diastolic pressure was      lower following mental arithmetic in the high-intensity group. No differences in       HR reactivity, electrodermal, or respiratory parameters were observed, but      baroreceptor reflex sensitivity was inhibited during mental arithmetic. The      results are discussed in relation to previous reports of suppressed      cardiovascular reactivity to mental stress tests following vigorous exercise and       the role of stress-related processes in the antihypertensive response to physical      training.FAU - Steptoe, AAU  - Steptoe AAD  - Department of Psychology, St. George's Hospital Medical School, University of      London, United Kingdom.FAU - Kearsley, NAU  - Kearsley NFAU - Walters, NAU  - Walters NLA  - engPT  - Clinical TrialPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Randomized Controlled TrialPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - UNITED STATESTA  - PsychophysiologyJT  - PsychophysiologyJID - 0142657SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Blood Pressure/physiologyMH  - Exercise/*physiologyMH  - Heart Rate/physiologyMH  - Hemodynamics/*physiologyMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Physical Fitness/physiologyMH  - SportsMH  - Stress, Psychological/*physiopathologyMH  - Task Performance and AnalysisEDAT- 1993/05/01MHDA- 1993/05/01 00:01CRDT- 1993/05/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Psychophysiology. 1993 May;30(3):245-52.PMID- 8493674OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19930611DCOM- 19930611LR  - 20080716IS  - 0029-2001 (Print)IS  - 0029-2001 (Linking)VI  - 113IP  - 9DP  - 1993 Mar 30TI  - [Dilemmas in sports medicine--a medical challenge].PG  - 1076-7AB  - The theme of the article is ethical problems and dilemmas in sports medicine.

Male (n = 99) and female       (n = 115) teacher-head basketball coaches from NCAA Division III and NAIA      colleges completed established measures of burnout, perceived stress,      teacher-coach role conflict, and social support and a measure of coaching issues       developed for this study. Multivariate analyses supported the hypothesized      relationships. Specifically, greater satisfaction with social support, less      experience, and gender (females higher) were related to stress appraisal, and all      stress appraisal variables were positively related to burnout. Contrary to      previous studies, these teacher-coaches reported moderate to high levels of      burnout.FAU - Kelley, B CAU  - Kelley BCAD  - Department of Physical Education, Southern Illinois University, Carbondale.FAU - Gill, D LAU  - Gill DLLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Res Q Exerc SportJT  - Research quarterly for exercise and sportJID - 8006373SB  - IMMH  - Burnout, Professional/*psychologyMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Sex FactorsMH  - Social SupportMH  - Sports/*educationMH  - Stress, Physiological/*psychologyMH  - *TeachingEDAT- 1993/03/01MHDA- 1993/03/01 00:01CRDT- 1993/03/01 00:00AID - 10.1080/02701367.1993.10608783 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Res Q Exerc Sport. 1993 Mar;64(1):94-102.PMID- 1415034OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19921029DCOM- 19921029LR  - 20041117IS  - 0002-922X (Print)IS  - 0002-922X (Linking)VI  - 146IP  - 10DP  - 1992 OctTI  - Coaches: a missing link in the health care system.PG  - 1130FAU - Kincaide, J EAU  - Kincaide JELA  - engPT  - CommentPT  - LetterPL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Am J Dis ChildJT  - American journal of diseases of children (1960)JID - 0370471SB  - AIMSB  - IMCON - Am J Dis Child. 1992 Feb;146(2):211-7.

High contextual interference, even though causing immediate      limited performance, leads to superior performance on retention and transfer      tests. Four experimental groups (13 students each) were placed in conditions of      random, blocked, serial, and serial with high interference practice for 8      meetings (2 tests and 6 practice). Analysis yielded significant differences among      the groups on a transfer test (long transfer) for the serve, so results in this      instructional setting are partially in line with those generally found in      laboratory experiments.FAU - Bortoli, LAU  - Bortoli LAD  - Physical Education Institute of Padova, Italia.FAU - Robazza, CAU  - Robazza CFAU - Durigon, VAU  - Durigon VFAU - Carra, CAU  - Carra CLA  - engPT  - Clinical TrialPT  - Controlled Clinical TrialPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Percept Mot SkillsJT  - Perceptual and motor skillsJID - 0401131SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - *AttentionMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - *Mental RecallMH  - *Motor SkillsMH  - Practice (Psychology)MH  - Retention (Psychology)MH  - *SportsMH  - Transfer (Psychology)EDAT- 1992/10/01MHDA- 1992/10/01 00:01CRDT- 1992/10/01 00:00AID - 10.2466/pms.1992.75.2.555 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Percept Mot Skills. 1992 Oct;75(2):555-62.PMID- 1410787OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19921106DCOM- 19921106LR  - 20061115IS  - 0034-3536 (Print)IS  - 0034-3536 (Linking)VI  - 31IP  - 3DP  - 1992 AugTI  - [Changes in health status and attitude due to sports with rheumatic disease      patients].PG  - 198-201AB  - A six-months sports programme had been implemented to analyze the impact of      movement, play and sports on the physical situation of persons having rheumatism,      their mental well-being and attitudes towards sporting activities. 41 patients      participated in the programme, attending training sessions in a fitness studio      once a week.

The following assessment tools were used: Measurement      of Patient Outcome (MOPO) scales, sports questionnaire, and the STEP test. It was      found that participants' health status, both physical and mental, had been      influenced in a positive manner, with proof being provided of reduced levels of      anxiety, depression, and pain.

This is not only a       great personal loss but also a financial loss, both to the injured person and to       the community. Statistics should be tabulated on catastrophic injuries that leave      the person with a physical or mental deficit, such as a blind eye, and efforts      should be directed toward preventing such injuries. Changing and enforcing game      rules and providing proper eye protection has proved very beneficial in Canadian       hockey, racket sports and war games. Educational programs supported by the media       and government that alert players to the need for eye protection are required.      Such measures may lead to the prevention of up to 90% of injuries in sports and      recreational activities in Canada.FAU - Pashby, T JAU  - Pashby TJLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - CANADATA  - Can J OphthalmolJT  - Canadian journal of ophthalmology.

It also examines the strategies that sports      performers could use to overcome these effects. The major sources of stress that       have been reported by sports performers include fear of failure, concerns about      social evaluation by others (particularly the coach), lack of readiness to      perform, and loss of internal control over one's environment. Various models and       theories of the effects of such stress upon performance and vulnerability to      injury are reviewed, including multidimensional anxiety theory and a catastrophe       model of anxiety and performance. The cognitive and physiological processes which      are thought to underly these effects are also reviewed, together with the      intervention strategies that are implied by these processes. Research on the      psychological stress that appears to be experienced by performers when they are      injured is very limited. However, that which is available suggests that many of      the same psychological skills that are thought to enhance performance can also be      used to reduce the risk of injury, and promote a speedy recovery from injury.      These include goal-setting, imagery, self-talk, and relaxation skills.FAU - Hardy, LAU  - Hardy LAD  - University of Wales, Bangor, Gwynedd, UK.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - ENGLANDTA  - Br Med BullJT  - British medical bulletinJID - 0376542SB  - IMMH  - Adaptation, PsychologicalMH  - AdultMH  - *AnxietyMH  - Athletic Injuries/*psychologyMH  - HumansMH  - PsychotherapyMH  - Stress, Psychological/*physiopathologyRF  - 70EDAT- 1992/07/01MHDA- 1992/07/01 00:01CRDT- 1992/07/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Br Med Bull. 1992 Jul;48(3):615-29.PMID- 24241784OWN - NLMSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINEDA  - 20131118DCOM- 20131119IS  - 1050-5350 (Print)IS  - 1050-5350 (Linking)VI  - 8IP  - 2DP  - 1992 JunTI  - Predicting outcomes: Sports and stocks.PG  - 201-22LID - 10.1007/BF01014636 [doi]AB  - Many gamblers and most fans, players, and coaches offer causal explanations for      long runs of good or bad performance in sports and financial analysts are quick      to offer explanations for the daily performance of the stock market. The records       of professional basketball and baseball teams and the Dow Jones daily closing      average for a ten year period were evaluated for trends (streaks). The records of      teams were also evaluated to assess whether the record against opponents, the      home court or home field advantage, and-for baseball teams-the record of the      winning and losing pitcher (excluding the current game) predicted the outcome of       individual games. Recent performance is, at best, a very weak predictor of      current performance and the three best predictors for baseball (pitching, home      field, and record against opponent) together accounted for only 1.7% of the      variance in the outcomes of individual games. We overestimate our ability to      predict.

To win, it needs      superstar players with specialized tasks, but it also needs team players who can       be relied on to maintain constant performance. Growth factor receptors or      transcriptional activators might be considered to be the cell's superstars,      whereas ribosomes could be considered team players that faithfully carry out      directions from mRNA. The team also needs a head coach for overall direction and       assistant coaches to direct the basic skills. The assistant coaches should ensure      that basic cellular functions proceed correctly and that the cell responds to      specific stimuli. Since almost every phosphorylatable protein is modified by      several protein kinases, protein kinases like casein kinases I and II might be      the assistant coaches of cellular regulation.FAU - Hoekstra, M FAU  - Hoekstra MFAD  - Molecular Biology and Virology Lab, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies,      10010 N.

The aim of this paper is to provide a      framework for understanding the developmental, occupational, pathologic,      therapeutic, and research aspects of sport psychiatry. METHOD: Studies in      psychiatry, psychology, and psychoanalysis provide the basis for this overview,      and nonscientific works are cited where they illuminate various issues.      Illustrative case examples are also reported. RESULTS: It is proposed, but not      proven, that athletes undergo phase-specific development and that they may suffer      impairments in adapting to the athletic context. This context may also modify      treatment modalities. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for more clinical studies of      athletes, especially in the realms of childhood traumas, competitive issues, and       mental illnesses. Because of the close relationship of mental and physical      phenomena in sports and because athletic behaviors are often precisely      measurable, athletics may constitute a fruitful area for psychiatric research.FAU - Begel, DAU  - Begel DAD  - Department of Psychiatry, Medical College of Wisconsin 53226.LA  - engPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Am J PsychiatryJT  - The American journal of psychiatryJID - 0370512SB  - AIMSB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - Athletic Injuries/psychologyMH  - ChildMH  - Child DevelopmentMH  - Child, PreschoolMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Mental Disorders/diagnosis/psychology/therapyMH  - *PsychiatryMH  - Psychoanalytic TheoryMH  - PsychotherapyMH  - Sports/*psychologyMH  - Sports MedicineRF  - 90EDAT- 1992/05/01MHDA- 1992/05/01 00:01CRDT- 1992/05/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Am J Psychiatry. 1992 May;149(5):606-14.PMID- 1733152OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19920225DCOM- 19920225LR  - 20061115IS  - 0002-922X (Print)IS  - 0002-922X (Linking)VI  - 146IP  - 2DP  - 1992 FebTI  - Coaches.

Although      the need for coaches has increased due to the advent of girls' athletic programs,      which was mandated by Title IX legislation, only a minority of states require      certification for coaches who work in school systems. Four coaching curricula are      summarized and contrasted: the American Coaching Effectiveness Program, the      curriculum of the National Youth Sports Coaches Association, the Athletic Health       Care System, and the Coach Effectiveness Training Program. Recommendations for      coach certification by states, physician advocacy for coaching standards, and      improved sports medicine services are discussed.FAU - Brown, B R JrAU  - Brown BR JrAD  - Department of Pediatrics, Eastern Maine Medical Center, Bangor.FAU - Butterfield, S AAU  - Butterfield SALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Am J Dis ChildJT  - American journal of diseases of children (1960)JID - 0370471SB  - AIMSB  - IMCIN - Am J Dis Child. 1992 Oct;146(10):1130.

Although adolescents in general are particularly      vulnerable to the onset of eating disorders, little research has examined the      problem among high school female athletes. The present study explored this      population by comparing female athletes and nonathletes in terms of (a)      behavioral and psychological traits associated with eating disorders and (b) use       of pathogenic weight control techniques (laxatives, vomiting, fasting, and diet      aids). Sport-by-sport comparisons were also investigated to determine if athletes      in specific sports were more at risk. Moreover, in an attempt to link athletic      participation and eating disordered behavior, the gender-role orientation of      athletes was examined. Results indicated that (a) athletes were more likely than       nonathletes to possess certain behavioral and psychological correlates of eating       disorders, (b) there were few differences among the various sport teams, and (c)       gender-role orientation was generally not a critical variable. Although group      comparisons yielded limited significant differences, athletes nevertheless      reported traits associated with eating disorders as well as use of pathogenic      weight control techniques. The unique contributions of the sport context and      coaching practices exacerbating disordered eating are discussed.FAU - Taub, D EAU  - Taub DEAD  - Department of Sociology, Southern Illinois University, Carbondale 62901.FAU - Blinde, E MAU  - Blinde EMLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - UNITED STATESTA  - AdolescenceJT  - AdolescenceJID - 0123667SB  - IMSB  - XMH  - AdolescentMH  - Anorexia Nervosa/diagnosis/psychologyMH  - Body ImageMH  - Bulimia/diagnosis/psychologyMH  - Diet, Reducing/psychologyMH  - Eating Disorders/diagnosis/*psychologyMH  - FemaleMH  - Gender IdentityMH  - HumansMH  - Personality Inventory/statistics & numerical dataMH  - PsychometricsMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - *SportsEDAT- 1992/01/01MHDA- 1992/01/01 00:01CRDT- 1992/01/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Adolescence. 1992 Winter;27(108):833-48.PMID- 1942455OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19911213DCOM- 19911213LR  - 20140917IS  - 0098-7484 (Print)IS  - 0098-7484 (Linking)VI  - 266IP  - 20DP  - 1991 Nov 27TI  - Concussion in sports. Guidelines for the prevention of catastrophic outcome.PG  - 2867-9AB  - Concussion (defined as a traumatically induced alteration in mental status, not      necessarily with loss of consciousness) is a common form of sports-related injury      too often dismissed as trivial by physicians, athletic trainers, coaches, sports       reporters, and athletes themselves. While head injuries can occur in virtually      any form of athletic activity, they occur most frequently in contact sports, such      as football, boxing, and martial arts competition, or from high-velocity      collisions or falls in basketball, soccer, and ice hockey. The pathophysiology of      concussion is less well understood than that of severe head injury, and it has      received less attention as a result. We describe a high school football player      who died of diffuse brain swelling after repeated concussions without loss of      consciousness.

The experiment was      carried out in the field during precision shooting competitions and in the      laboratory for imagery activity, on 22 subjects. Results show that there is      similarity of ANS response in the three situations: the period of concentration      prior to shooting, actual shooting and mental representation of shooting. The      ratio formed by ANS response during concentration and imagery of actual firing      tends towards the value one, therefore towards some identity. All subjects may be      classified around this value; it is worth noting that subject distribution around      this value corresponds to performance value. It seems that the better the      subject, the closer his concentration/shooting or imagery/actual shooting ratio      is to the theoretical value one. These results show the utmost importance of the       quality of mental representation for performance improvement. It can be supposed       that subject classification above the theoretical value one corresponds to      overflowing emotional reactivity in one of the two phases and that this      interferes with accuracy; a placing below the theoretical value one shows a lack       of similarity between mental representation and the action.FAU - Deschaumes-Molinaro, CAU  - Deschaumes-Molinaro CAD  - Laboratoire de Physiologie neurosensorielle, CNRS-University Claude Bernard/Lyon,      Villeurbanne, France.FAU - Dittmar, AAU  - Dittmar AFAU - Vernet-Maury, EAU  - Vernet-Maury ELA  - engPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - NETHERLANDSTA  - Behav Brain ResJT  - Behavioural brain researchJID - 8004872SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - AnimalsMH  - *Arousal/physiologyMH  - *Attention/physiologyMH  - Autonomic Nervous System/physiologyMH  - Galvanic Skin Response/physiologyMH  - Heart Rate/physiologyMH  - HumansMH  - *Imagination/physiologyMH  - MiceMH  - *Practice (Psychology)MH  - Psychomotor Performance/physiologyMH  - Respiration/physiologyMH  - Skin Temperature/physiologyMH  - Sports/*psychologyEDAT- 1991/10/25MHDA- 1991/10/25 00:01CRDT- 1991/10/25 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Behav Brain Res. 1991 Oct 25;45(1):29-36.PMID- 1766791OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19920220DCOM- 19920220LR  - 20041117IS  - 0031-5125 (Print)IS  - 0031-5125 (Linking)VI  - 73IP  - 2DP  - 1991 OctTI  - Describing sport grounds: an investigation of 'functional' and 'acquaintance'      familiarity.PG  - 583-90AB  - The present research was designed to investigate the concept of familiarity and      how different kinds of familiarity could affect the coding and memory of places      having specific and strong functional significance, i.e., sport courts.

In some instances, these predictors have      been well studied and are recognized by participants as well as coaches,      dentists, and other responsible parties. In other instances, there is much to be       learned about these predictors. There is no question that predictors have direct       influence upon the incidence and prevalence data for dental injuries related to      each sport. Because of the variability of these predictors from one sport to      another, from one sports participant to another, from one age group to another,      and even from on playground, field, or court to another, the importance and      validity and usefulness of much of the data available currently is debatable. The      importance of sports dentistry is not based solely on the urgency afforded by a      given number of injuries among a specified number of participants over a certain       amount of time. It is the predictable nature of these injuries and the need for      the profession to take responsible action in their prevention and treatment that       provides the strongest imperative for a sports dentistry movement.FAU - Pinkham, J RAU  - Pinkham JRAD  - Pediatric Dentistry, University of Iowa College of Dentistry, Iowa City.FAU - Kohn, D WAU  - Kohn DWLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Dent Clin North AmJT  - Dental clinics of North AmericaJID - 0217440SB  - DSB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Athletic Injuries/*epidemiology/etiologyMH  - ChildMH  - HumansMH  - Maxillofacial Injuries/*epidemiology/etiologyMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Mouth/*injuriesMH  - ProbabilityMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - *Tooth InjuriesMH  - United States/epidemiologyRF  - 61EDAT- 1991/10/01MHDA- 1991/10/01 00:01CRDT- 1991/10/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Dent Clin North Am. 1991 Oct;35(4):609-26.PMID- 1784872OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19920317DCOM- 19920317LR  - 20041117IS  - 0112-1642 (Print)IS  - 0112-1642 (Linking)VI  - 12IP  - 3DP  - 1991 SepTI  - Quantification of training in competitive sports. Methods and applications.PG  - 161-83AB  - The training of competitive athletes can be assessed by retrospective      questionnaires, diaries, physiological monitoring and direct observation of      training behaviour. Questionnaires represent the most economical, most      comprehensive and least accurate method. Diaries are more valid, but their      drawbacks for long term quantitative studies are poor compliance and difficulties      in processing the data they generate. Physiological monitoring (of oxygen      consumption, heart rate or blood lactate concentration) provides objective      measures of training intensity, and direct observation gives valid measures of      most aspects of training; however, these methods are impractical for continuous,       long term use. Coaches and athletes quantify training for purposes of motivation,      systematisation of training and training prescription, but there has been little       study of the use of training quantification by these practitioners. Motivation      and systematisation are probably achieved best with diaries. Direct observation      appears to be the best method of ensuring compliance with a training      prescription, although heart rate monitoring is also a promising method for      prescribing endurance training intensity. Sport scientists quantify training to      study its effects on the performance and health status of competitive athletes.      Most studies have been descriptive rather than experimental, and unvalidated      questionnaires have been the predominant method of assaying training. The main      areas of research include performance prediction and enhancement, overtraining,      reproductive dysfunction, injury, illness, and nutritional status. Training has      substantial effects in all of these areas. There is a need for more experimental       studies that utilise validated measures of training to investigate how to reduce       sports injuries and enhance competitive sports performance. More attention could       also be given to methodological issues of training quantification.FAU - Hopkins, W GAU  - Hopkins WGAD  - Department of Physiology, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - NEW ZEALANDTA  - Sports MedJT  - Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)JID - 8412297RN  - 0 (Lactates)SB  - IMMH  - Athletic Injuries/etiologyMH  - Competitive BehaviorMH  - Heart RateMH  - HumansMH  - Lactates/bloodMH  - Medical RecordsMH  - MotivationMH  - Oxygen ConsumptionMH  - Physical Education and Training/*methodsMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - *SportsRF  - 222EDAT- 1991/09/01MHDA- 1991/09/01 00:01CRDT- 1991/09/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Sports Med. 1991 Sep;12(3):161-83.PMID- 1745420OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19920114DCOM- 19920114LR  - 20041117IS  - 0885-842X (Print)IS  - 0885-842X (Linking)VI  - 88IP  - 9DP  - 1991 SepTI  - Sports injuries in the female athlete.PG  - 643-5AB  - Women are successfully participating in a variety of sports in increasing      numbers, both recreationally and competitively. There are certain anatomic and      physiologic differences between men and women that make each sex unique, but      there also are multiple external factors that significantly influence athletic      performance. The nature of injuries seems to be more sports-specific than      gender-specific. Even the increased susceptibility to overuse syndromes found in       women may be reduced by increasing awareness and redefining conditioning and      coaching techniques.

Compatibility among a sample of 52 elite tennis coach/player dyads      was assessed using a sport adapted version of Schutz's (1966) Fundamental      Interpersonal Relations Orientation-Behaviour (FIRO-B), a sport adapted version      of Fiedler's (1967) Least Preferred Co-worker scale (LPC), and Chelladurai and      Saleh's (1980) Leadership Scale for Sport (LSS). Self-ratings of the quality of      the interaction were obtained from both coach and athlete. Multiple-regression      analyses using self-rating scores as the dependent measure were carried out to      determine which variables best predicted the degree of compatibility. The sole      inventory that significantly predicted compatibility was the LSS. More      specifically, the discrepancy between the athlete's preferences and perceptions      on the autocratic dimension was the best predictor.

Players from two colleges were      evaluated for general and specific performance variables prior to a regular      season match between the teams. A player's ability rating was the total of four      coaches' ranking on a 1-to-10 scale. Multiple regression analysis to predict      player ability rating selected age, vertical jump, total body movement time, and       agility (R = 0.87). However, step-wise discriminant analysis to differentiate      winning and losing team members selected shoulder flexibility, agility, forearm      bump, and sit-and-reach flexibility. The canonical correlation between the      winning-losing dichotomy and these skills was 0.74 and resulted in proper      classification of 84.6% of the correct team members. It was concluded that the      skills coaches consider indicative of superior ability are not necessarily the      factors which dictate winning performance.FAU - Marey, SAU  - Marey SAD  - Human Performance Laboratory, Northeast Missouri State University, Kirksville.FAU - Boleach, L WAU  - Boleach LWFAU - Mayhew, J LAU  - Mayhew JLFAU - Mcdole, SAU  - Mcdole SLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - ITALYTA  - J Sports Med Phys FitnessJT  - The Journal of sports medicine and physical fitnessJID - 0376337SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Competitive Behavior/physiologyMH  - FemaleMH  - ForecastingMH  - HumansMH  - Motor Activity/*physiologyMH  - Physical Education and Training/*methodsMH  - Regression AnalysisMH  - *SportsEDAT- 1991/06/01MHDA- 1991/06/01 00:01CRDT- 1991/06/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Med Phys Fitness. 1991 Jun;31(2):161-4.PMID- 1647864OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19910808DCOM- 19910808LR  - 20041117IS  - 0833-1235 (Print)IS  - 0833-1235 (Linking)VI  - 16IP  - 2DP  - 1991 JunTI  - Do coaches encourage aggressive behaviour in sport?PG  - 85-6FAU - Leith, L MAU  - Leith LMLA  - engPT  - CommentPT  - EditorialPL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Can J Sport SciJT  - Canadian journal of sport sciences = Journal canadien des sciences du sportJID - 8707670SB  - IMCON - Can J Sport Sci. 1991 Jun;16(2):103-9.

A questionnaire was mailed to all athletic directors and teacher      athletic trainers in North Carolina high schools. Of the 821 surveys sent, 303      were returned (a response rate of 37%). The sample was grouped into three      categories on the basis of the perceived role of the respondent: coach (n = 152),      trainer (n = 91), and dual coach-trainer (n = 29). Thirty-one individuals who      indicated that they held administrative positions with little or no contact with       students were omitted from the analysis. One-way analysis of variance or chi 2      was used to examine differences in questionnaire responses among the three      groups. In comparison with high school coaches, trainers had taken more workshops      or courses related to nutrition (2.9 compared with 1.8) and had more frequently      used professional meetings (62% vs 39%), workshops (64% vs 41%), and textbooks      (75% vs 50%) as sources of information. Trainers were more knowledgeable about      nutrition (9.6 correct responses vs 8.9 for coaches) and recommended desirable      nutrition practices more often than coaches (7 of 9 vs 6 of 9). There was some      disagreement between coaches and trainers in their perceptions of who was more      important in dispensing nutrition information. Future nutrition education efforts      should take into account the differences among these groups.FAU - Graves, K LAU  - Graves KLAD  - Department of Nutrition, School of Public Health, University of North Carolina,      Chapel Hill 27599.FAU - Farthing, M CAU  - Farthing MCFAU - Smith, S AAU  - Smith SAFAU - Turchi, J MAU  - Turchi JMLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - UNITED STATESTA  - J Am Diet AssocJT  - Journal of the American Dietetic AssociationJID - 7503061SB  - AIMSB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Attitude to HealthMH  - Educational StatusMH  - HumansMH  - *Nutritional RequirementsMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - SchoolsMH  - *Sports MedicineMH  - TeachingEDAT- 1991/03/01MHDA- 1991/03/01 00:01CRDT- 1991/03/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Am Diet Assoc. 1991 Mar;91(3):321-4.PMID- 10350743OWN - NLMSTAT- PublisherDA  - 19990601IS  - 1041-3499 (Print)IS  - 1041-3499 (Linking)VI  - 2IP  - 1DP  - 1991 FebTI  - Epidemiology of Sports Injuries in Adolescents.PG  - 109-124AB  - This chapter discusses the epidemiology of injuries in organized sports in      adolescents from junior high school through college age.

Recent events are also reviewed, including the investigation into      the use of performance-enhancing drugs by Australian sportsmen and women (the      Black Enquiry), by the Canadians (the Dubin Enquiry) and by the British (the Coni      Enquiry and the Jacobs Enquiry). Recent political initiatives are considered, in       particular the major international agreements such as the Soviet-American Joint      Commission, the International Olympic Antidoping Charter and the European      Anti-Doping Convention. Sportsmen and women who, in the past, have been tested      positive for banned substances have been the focus of much attention from the      sporting community, the general public and the media, but others including      coaches, physicians, scientists and others, must share the blame for the spread      of drug abuse in sport. In the UK the new policies and programmes of the Sports      Council (and the Sports Councils in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland) should       provide a better programme for doping control than that previously used, and the       new international agreements should provide a better framework for international       cooperation on education, detection and research.FAU - Radford, P FAU  - Radford PFAD  - University of Glasgow, Department of Physical Education and Sports Science, UK.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - SCOTLANDTA  - J R Coll Surg EdinbJT  - Journal of the Royal College of Surgeons of EdinburghJID - 7503110SB  - IMMH  - Doping in Sports/*prevention & controlMH  - Great BritainMH  - HumansMH  - International CooperationMH  - Sports/*trendsMH  - Substance Abuse Detection/legislation & jurisprudence/*standardsMH  - *Substance-Related DisordersEDAT- 1990/12/01MHDA- 1990/12/01 00:01CRDT- 1990/12/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - J R Coll Surg Edinb. 1990 Dec;35(6 Suppl):S2-6.PMID- 2289280OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19910403DCOM- 19910403LR  - 20061115IS  - 0009-0689 (Print)IS  - 0009-0689 (Linking)VI  - 38IP  - 11DP  - 1990 NovTI  - [The impact of psychological stress on somatic and biochemical parameters in an      atypical sports discipline].PG  - 479-85AB  - The subject of our interest was to investigate the response of the organism to      mental strain in an atypical sports discipline. To this end we examined 10 chess       players. We assessed their pulse rate at rest, before a contest, immediately      after the contest and after 5 mins. recovery. Statistical evaluation revealed an       increased heart rate before the contest, as compared with rest at a level of      significance of 0.01; after the contest as compared with the status before the      contest at a level of 0.02; in the recovery stage, as compared with rest, at the       0.01 level. As a control group we examined 10 hockey players under the same      conditions and the results were compared with the chess players. For scientific      practice it is necessary to find a way to monitor the internal environment during      a chess game (catecholamines, lactate, glucose, fatty acids, cholesterol and      others). As soon as this will be possible without disturbing the reflection      process of the chess player, we shall be able to obtain more information on the      adaptation of the organism to mental strain during a game of chess.FAU - Kriz, MAU  - Kriz MAD  - Uzemna poliklinika Sabinov.FAU - Vokal, EAU  - Vokal EFAU - Krizova, MAU  - Krizova MLA  - sloPT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticleTT  - Odraz psychickeho zatazenia na niektore somaticke a biochemicke parametre u      atypickeho sportoveho odvetvia.PL  - CZECHOSLOVAKIATA  - Cesk ZdravJT  - Ceskoslovenske zdravotnictviJID - 0416604RN  - 0 (Catecholamines)SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Blood PressureMH  - Catecholamines/bloodMH  - ChildMH  - HockeyMH  - HumansMH  - *Play and PlaythingsMH  - PulseMH  - Stress, Psychological/blood/*physiopathologyEDAT- 1990/11/01MHDA- 1990/11/01 00:01CRDT- 1990/11/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Cesk Zdrav. 1990 Nov;38(11):479-85.PMID- 2257534OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19910129DCOM- 19910129LR  - 20041117IS  - 0833-1235 (Print)IS  - 0833-1235 (Linking)VI  - 15IP  - 3DP  - 1990 SepTI  - Expert assessment of the national coaching certification program (NCCP) theory      component.PG  - 201-12AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine if the educational objectives of the      revised national coaching certification theory program (NCCP) represent the      important and necessary skills needed to be an effective coach in both      contemporary and future Canadian society. A study sample of experts in coach      education in Canada (n = 75) agreed to participate in the investigation which was      based on a research protocol known as the Delphi technique.

Further, the experts seemed to favour a socio-psychological      orientation to the curriculum content at level 1 and level 2 and a balance      between the biophysical and the socio-psychological sports science areas at level      3.FAU - Haslam, I RAU  - Haslam IRAD  - University of Western, Ontario, London.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - CANADATA  - Can J Sport SciJT  - Canadian journal of sport sciences = Journal canadien des sciences du sportJID - 8707670SB  - IMMH  - CanadaMH  - *CertificationMH  - *CurriculumMH  - Delphi TechniqueMH  - EducationMH  - HumansMH  - *SportsEDAT- 1990/09/01MHDA- 1990/09/01 00:01CRDT- 1990/09/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Can J Sport Sci. 1990 Sep;15(3):201-12.PMID- 2257527OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19910129DCOM- 19910129LR  - 20041117IS  - 0833-1235 (Print)IS  - 0833-1235 (Linking)VI  - 15IP  - 3DP  - 1990 SepTI  - The national coaching certification program: objectives and reality.PG  - 163FAU - Leith, LAU  - Leith LLA  - engPT  - EditorialPL  - CANADATA  - Can J Sport SciJT  - Canadian journal of sport sciences = Journal canadien des sciences du sportJID - 8707670SB  - IMMH  - CanadaMH  - *CertificationMH  - *EducationMH  - HumansMH  - *SportsEDAT- 1990/09/01MHDA- 1990/09/01 00:01CRDT- 1990/09/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Can J Sport Sci. 1990 Sep;15(3):163.PMID- 2097689OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19910722DCOM- 19910722LR  - 20041117IS  - 0270-1367 (Print)IS  - 0270-1367 (Linking)VI  - 61IP  - 3DP  - 1990 SepTI  - Gender-role orientations of male and female coaches of a masculine-typed sport.PG  - 297-301FAU - Wrisberg, C AAU  - Wrisberg CAAD  - University of Tennessee-Knoxville.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Res Q Exerc SportJT  - Research quarterly for exercise and sportJID - 8006373SB  - IMMH  - BasketballMH  - *FacultyMH  - FemaleMH  - *Gender IdentityMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - *Physical Education and TrainingMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - *RoleMH  - *SportsMH  - United StatesMH  - UniversitiesEDAT- 1990/09/01MHDA- 1990/09/01 00:01CRDT- 1990/09/01 00:00AID - 10.1080/02701367.1990.10608695 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Res Q Exerc Sport. 1990 Sep;61(3):297-301.PMID- 2097682OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19910722DCOM- 19910722LR  - 20061115IS  - 0270-1367 (Print)IS  - 0270-1367 (Linking)VI  - 61IP  - 3DP  - 1990 SepTI  - Sex bias and the validity of believed differences between male and female      interscholastic athletic coaches.PG  - 259-67AB  - Previous research indicates that young athletes as well as athletic      administrators hold gender-role stereotypical beliefs about coaches that disfavor      females. The validity of two such beliefs (lack of qualified female coaches and      time constraints due to family responsibilities) was examined in a statewide      survey of 256 female and 296 male interscholastic coaches and a nationwide survey      of 2,719 male and 1,449 female interscholastic coaches. Statistical analyses (p      less than .001) indicated that female coaches were (a) more qualified than their       male counterparts with respect to coaching experience with female teams,      professional training, and professional experience; (b) as qualified as male      coaches with regard to intercollegiate playing experience; and (c) less qualified      than male coaches with respect to high school playing experience and coaching      experience with male teams.

Moreover, in       the last decade patients with chronic disorders have been encouraged to take part      in sporting activities as a part of their rehabilitation. Can epileptic patients       freely participate in sport or whether they are restricted to a certain extent by      their disorder? An important factor is freedom from seizures. If seizures have      been controlled for over 2 years the risk of relapse is the same as the risk of a      first seizure. The risk of patients drowning or falling, or their epilepsy      worsening because they are engaged in sport is thought to be low. Clinical data      suggest that the incidence of seizures during sports and exercise is reduced. In       the cooling down period, however, seizures tend to occur more frequently.      Physicians should encourage epileptic patients to participate in sporting      activities to enhance their physical fitness, self-esteem, and social      integration. Before giving advice about the most suitable type of sport, the      physician should known the patient's medical history, have a good insight into      the different types of sport and be able to judge the role and function of sport       to the particular patient. With certain precautions virtually all sports are      suitable for most epileptic patients and should therefore be encouraged. However,      a small minority of hospitalised patients with severe epilepsy need the      supervision of qualified trainers, coaches and volunteers.FAU - van Linschoten, RAU  - van Linschoten RAD  - Janus Jongbloed Research Centre, State University, Utrecht, The Netherlands.FAU - Backx, F JAU  - Backx FJFAU - Mulder, O GAU  - Mulder OGFAU - Meinardi, HAU  - Meinardi HLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPT  - ReviewPL  - NEW ZEALANDTA  - Sports MedJT  - Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)JID - 8412297SB  - IMMH  - Epilepsy/epidemiology/*physiopathologyMH  - ExerciseMH  - HumansMH  - IncidenceMH  - PrevalenceMH  - PrognosisMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - *SportsRF  - 103EDAT- 1990/07/01MHDA- 1990/07/01 00:01CRDT- 1990/07/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Sports Med. 1990 Jul;10(1):9-19.PMID- 2205755OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19901024DCOM- 19901024LR  - 20051116IS  - 0022-4707 (Print)IS  - 0022-4707 (Linking)VI  - 30IP  - 2DP  - 1990 JunTI  - Psychological risk factors and sports injuries.PG  - 202-21AB  - Injuries sustained during competitive sport activities are accepted as an      inherent part of the game. While it may be true that the associated risk of      participating in certain sports increases the chance of becoming hurt, it is safe      to assume many injuries can be avoided if preventive medicine is practiced.      Conditioning and strength training go a long way in protecting the athlete from      possible harm, but in some cases this is not enough. The accumulated effect of      psychological stressors (in and outside the athletic world) may cloud the mental       functioning of the athlete and override physical conditioning enough to      precipitate injury or prolong it. After extensive reviews of literature, it has      been determined that a collective researched list of psychological risk factors      can be recognized which may predispose an athlete (especially in a contact sport)      to injury (real or imagined).FAU - Kelley, M J JrAU  - Kelley MJ JrAD  - University of West Florida, Pensacola.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - ITALYTA  - J Sports Med Phys FitnessJT  - The Journal of sports medicine and physical fitnessJID - 0376337SB  - IMMH  - Athletic Injuries/*etiology/prevention & control/psychologyMH  - HumansMH  - *Life Change EventsMH  - Pain/psychologyMH  - *PersonalityMH  - Physical Education and TrainingMH  - Reaction TimeMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Self ConceptMH  - Stress, Psychological/*complications/psychologyMH  - Type A PersonalityRF  - 58EDAT- 1990/06/01MHDA- 2001/03/28 10:01CRDT- 1990/06/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Sports Med Phys Fitness. 1990 Jun;30(2):202-21.PMID- 2335685OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19900614DCOM- 19900614LR  - 20081121IS  - 0002-8223 (Print)IS  - 0002-8223 (Linking)VI  - 90IP  - 5DP  - 1990 MayTI  - Nutrition knowledge and dietary practices of college coaches.PG  - 705-9AB  - The objectives of this study were to measure nutrition knowledge of college      coaches, to identify educational and demographic factors that affect nutrition      knowledge of college coaches, to describe dietary practices recommended by these       coaches, and to identify major sources of nutrition information used by coaches.       Questionnaires were mailed to 296 coaches of senior and junior colleges in North       Carolina using a listing from the National Directory of College Athletics.      Coaches of the following sports were included: track and field, cross country,      swimming, tennis, basketball, gymnastics, golf, football, and wrestling. The      response rate was 36%. Seventy percent of the 15 nutrition knowledge test items      were answered correctly; however, only one-third of the coaches indicated a high       degree of certainty for the correctness of their responses. There were no      significant relationships between nutrition knowledge and sex, age, collegiate      conference, course work in nutrition, win/loss record, and years of coaching      experience. Major dietary problems of college athletes reported by coaches were      consumption of "junk food," poor eating habits, and consumption of an unbalanced       diet. The authors recommend an annual workshop for coaches, trainers, and      dietitians to develop criteria for nutrition assessment and body composition for       college athletes and to develop training diets. Special workshops for foodservice      personnel are also recommended.FAU - Corley, GAU  - Corley GAD  - Veterans Administration Medical Center, Salisbury, North Carolina 28144.FAU - Demarest-Litchford, MAU  - Demarest-Litchford MFAU - Bazzarre, T LAU  - Bazzarre TLLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - UNITED STATESTA  - J Am Diet AssocJT  - Journal of the American Dietetic AssociationJID - 7503061SB  - AIMSB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Attitude to HealthMH  - Body WeightMH  - DietMH  - *DieteticsMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Nutritional Physiological PhenomenaMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - *SportsEDAT- 1990/05/01MHDA- 1990/05/01 00:01CRDT- 1990/05/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Am Diet Assoc. 1990 May;90(5):705-9.PMID- 2350666OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19900719DCOM- 19900719LR  - 20131002IS  - 0306-3674 (Print)IS  - 0306-3674 (Linking)VI  - 24IP  - 1DP  - 1990 MarTI  - Sport accidents in childhood.PG  - 40-4AB  - Injuries among children during sporting activities are common.

Sport accidents account for 27 per cent of all       childhood accidents in this age group. Fifty-three per cent of the injured were      boys, and 47 per cent were girls. The boys sustained more severe injuries than      the girls. Soccer caused the greatest number of injuries. Horse riding and alpine      skiing were the cause of the most severe injuries. A more widespread use of      protective guards, better technique and body control, better coaching and not      allowing the younger children to take part in technically advanced sporting      activities might reduce the number and the severity of the sport injuries in      children.FAU - Sahlin, YAU  - Sahlin YAD  - Emergency Clinic, Regional and University Hospital, Trondheim, Norway.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - ENGLANDTA  - Br J Sports MedJT  - British journal of sports medicineJID - 0432520SB  - IMMH  - Accidents/*statistics & numerical dataMH  - AdolescentMH  - Age FactorsMH  - ChildMH  - Child, PreschoolMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - MorbidityMH  - Protective DevicesMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Sex FactorsMH  - *SportsMH  - Wounds and Injuries/diagnosis/*epidemiology/prevention & controlPMC - PMC1478768OID - NLM: PMC1478768EDAT- 1990/03/01MHDA- 1990/03/01 00:01CRDT- 1990/03/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Br J Sports Med. 1990 Mar;24(1):40-4.PMID- 2331635OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19900607DCOM- 19900607LR  - 20041117IS  - 0833-1235 (Print)IS  - 0833-1235 (Linking)VI  - 15IP  - 1DP  - 1990 MarTI  - Verbal and non-verbal feedback from coaches.PG  - 3-4FAU - Leith, L MAU  - Leith LMLA  - engPT  - CommentPT  - EditorialPL  - CANADATA  - Can J Sport SciJT  - Canadian journal of sport sciences = Journal canadien des sciences du sportJID - 8707670SB  - IMCON - Can J Sport Sci. 1990 Mar;15(1):17-22.

The      design was a two (facial congruency) by two (verbal feedback) completely      randomized factorial. The facial expression was either congruent or incongruent      with verbal feedback. Seventy-one university students (39 males, 32 females) were      randomly assigned to one of the four experimental conditions. Each student      watched a videotape of facial-verbal pairings and evaluated (a) the percentage of      positive and negative statements, (b) the emotions expressed by the coach. The      analysis indicated that incongruent facial expressions distorted, in a negative      direction, the expected frequency of positive feedback. The emotional state      findings illustrated that the presence of any negative stimuli (face or verbal)      produced the perception of negative affect. The findings provided converging      evidence that inconsistencies in facial-verbal expression have a powerful effect       on the perception of verbal feedback and emotional state.FAU - Crocker, P RAU  - Crocker PRAD  - School of Physical Education, Lakehead University, Thunder Bay, Ontario.LA  - engPT  - Clinical TrialPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Randomized Controlled TrialPL  - CANADATA  - Can J Sport SciJT  - Canadian journal of sport sciences = Journal canadien des sciences du sportJID - 8707670SB  - IMCIN - Can J Sport Sci. 1990 Mar;15(1):3-4.

Of the 12 participation motivation      items, "learn to do my best," "learn and improve skills," "have a coach to look      up to," and "get stronger and healthier" were most highly rated, whereas "win      games" and "become popular" were rated least important. When responses of 6 and 7      year olds were compared with those of 9 and 10 year olds, older children rated      "feel part of a team", "have fun and excitement" and "be with and make new      friends" higher at a statistically significant level (p less than 0.05). Older      children rated "win games" and "become popular" lower at a statistically      significant level (p less than 0.05). The authors conclude that young children in      this recreational sports program make significant distinctions in their      participation motivation and that some aspects of participation that motivate      them change as they grow older.FAU - Stern, H PAU  - Stern HPAD  - Department of Pediatrics, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little      Rock 72205.FAU - Bradley, R HAU  - Bradley RHFAU - Prince, M TAU  - Prince MTFAU - Stroh, S EAU  - Stroh SELA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Clin Pediatr (Phila)JT  - Clinical pediatricsJID - 0372606SB  - AIMSB  - IMMH  - Aging/psychologyMH  - ArkansasMH  - Basketball/psychologyMH  - ChildMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - *MotivationMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Recreation/*psychologyMH  - Socioeconomic FactorsMH  - Sports/*psychologyMH  - Urban Population/statistics & numerical dataEDAT- 1990/02/01MHDA- 1990/02/01 00:01CRDT- 1990/02/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Clin Pediatr (Phila). 1990 Feb;29(2):89-94.PMID- 2211073OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19901120DCOM- 19901120LR  - 20051116IS  - 0333-7308 (Print)IS  - 0333-7308 (Linking)VI  - 27IP  - 2DP  - 1990TI  - Exercise and sport in mental health: a review of the literature.PG  - 99-112AB  - A literature survey was conducted of the most prominent psychological effects and      therapeutic applications of physical activity in mental health.

With increasing interest in this      sport, the need arises to identify areas where further research is necessary and       cooperation between individuals with various backgrounds is encouraged. Many of      the problems facing investigators in this field require knowledge in several      areas of science and engineering, which suggests an interdisciplinary approach to      these issues. Further progress would also benefit from the development of more      quantitative methods for the classification of wheelchair athletes, or a      restructuring of the classification system; development of sophisticated      instrumentation for racing wheelchairs; standardization of test procedures and      more complete reporting of results of studies; and, more in-depth mathematical      modelling and computer simulation of wheelchair racing. This review presents an      overview of four areas of wheelchair racing science: 1) classification of      wheelchair athletes; 2) design and analysis of racing wheelchairs; 3)      biomechanics of racing wheelchair propulsion; and, 4) training and coaching of      wheelchair racers.FAU - Cooper, R AAU  - Cooper RAAD  - Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, California State University,      Sacramento 95819.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - UNITED STATESTA  - J Rehabil Res DevJT  - Journal of rehabilitation research and developmentJID - 8410047SB  - IMMH  - Biomechanical PhenomenaMH  - Computer SimulationMH  - Equipment DesignMH  - HumansMH  - MovementMH  - *SportsMH  - Wheelchairs/*standardsRF  - 78EDAT- 1990/01/01MHDA- 1990/01/01 00:01CRDT- 1990/01/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Rehabil Res Dev. 1990 Summer;27(3):295-312.PMID- 2814430OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19891218DCOM- 19891218LR  - 20061115IS  - 0036-7885 (Print)IS  - 0036-7885 (Linking)VI  - 37IP  - 3DP  - 1989 OctTI  - [The coach of artistic gymnastics facing medical problems: results of a survey      conducted in French-speaking Switzerland].PG  - 162-6AB  - The need for high technical skills in gymnastics has resulted in a decrease of      the age of talented gymnasts. Young gymnasts are submitted to intensive training,      hence to an increase of the risk of injuries. In spite of this evolution, present      medical assistance does not appear to be readily accessible to swiss coaches and       gymnasts. By necessity, coaches endorse medical functions which have so far not      been evaluated. This aspect was therefore investigated among coaches from the      french speaking community of our country. The results show that the present      medical network hinders regular follow-up of gymnasts and valuable discussions      between coaches and doctors with, as a result, inappropriate medical teaching.      Coaches distrust advice given by doctors of whom most underestimate the technical      aspects of this sport.

It is therefore essential to ensure very careful health       care and also very strict criteria for enlistment of children to avoid      pathological adaptation to the sports load. Specialized sports training of 14-18       hours per week may, in case of incorrect compensating activity, be the basis for       the development of secondary changes. In the selection it is important to adhere       to criteria pertaining to health, performance, function and development and to      evaluate them in relation to the character of the sports discipline and      preparation for attaining top performance. Based on six years' experience, it is       possible to indicate for the purpose of orientation the risks of different sports      for the locomotor system during ontogenesis.

Adults who coach the children largely      determine what the children's sports experience will be. Coaches' perceptions of       what is important for the young children they instruct have not yet been      carefully investigated. This study was designed, therefore, to determine coaches'      goals for young children. Data were gathered by use of an attitude questionnaire       administered to 29 coaches of a recreational basketball program of children      ranging in age from 6 to 10 years old. Of the 12 goals, feeling part of a team,      learning to do my best, and having fun and excitement were most highly rated as      extremely important, while becoming popular was lowest rated as not important.      Results revealed that coaches in general are able to clearly define their goals      and priorities, and these goals seem developmentally appropriate for the      children. However, coaches make little differentiation in goals based on age.FAU - Stern, PAU  - Stern PAD  - Department of Pediatrics, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little      Rock, 72205.FAU - Prince, M TAU  - Prince MTFAU - Bradley, R HAU  - Bradley RHFAU - Stroh, S EAU  - Stroh SELA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Clin Pediatr (Phila)JT  - Clinical pediatricsJID - 0372606SB  - AIMSB  - IMMH  - AttitudeMH  - *BasketballMH  - ChildMH  - *Child DevelopmentMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - *PerceptionMH  - *Psychology, ChildMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - *SportsEDAT- 1989/06/01MHDA- 1989/06/01 00:01CRDT- 1989/06/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Clin Pediatr (Phila). 1989 Jun;28(6):277-81.PMID- 2489836OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19910626DCOM- 19910626LR  - 20041117IS  - 0270-1367 (Print)IS  - 0270-1367 (Linking)VI  - 60IP  - 2DP  - 1989 JunTI  - Gender differences in coaching philosophy: the case of female basketball teams.PG  - 152-8AB  - With the advent of Title IX, the proportion of female participants in      interscholastic sport has risen sharply while the proportion of female coaches      has dropped precipitously. This paper seeks to determine whether there are any      differences in coaching philosophy by gender. Questionnaires were sent to the      coaches of 600 high school girls' basketball teams selected randomly from the 48       contiguous states. There were 250 usable ones returned for a response rate of      42%. The questionnaires included items designed to assess the attitudes and      behaviors of coaches in five areas of coaching philosophy: (1) the coach's role      in the overall development of athletes; (2) conditions believed essential to      maximize team performance; (3) team rules used; (4) use of sports aphorisms; and       (5) expectations of athletes. Summing the findings, we found that in 83 of the      100 comparisons there were no statistical differences in the means of the male      and female coaches. In the 17 instances where there were statistically      significant differences, 14 times the female coaches were on the more traditional      side.

Competitive trait      anxiety (CTA) is a personality disposition which reflects the tendency to      experience stress in situations involving competitive sport (20). Multiple      regression analyses of questionnaire data revealed that boys with more frequent      somatic competitive trait anxiety symptoms 1) had lower self-esteem, 2) reported       greater upset if they performed poorly, and 3) expressed a greater preference for      avoiding a tournament match. Investigated cognitive anxiety symptoms involved      characteristic precompetitive worries about failure and worries about adult      expectations and evaluation. Youngsters with more frequent worries about failure       placed greater importance on wrestling well and felt greater upset when they      performed poorly, in comparison with boys who worried less frequently about      failure. More frequent adult-related worries were predicted by greater personal      upset for poor performance and perceptions of 1) greater parental and coach shame      and upset, 2) more negative adult evaluations, and 3) greater parental pressure      to wrestle.FAU - Lewthwaite, RAU  - Lewthwaite RAD  - Department of Human Kinetics, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee 53201.FAU - Scanlan, T KAU  - Scanlan TKLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Med Sci Sports ExercJT  - Medicine and science in sports and exerciseJID - 8005433SB  - IMSB  - SMH  - AdolescentMH  - Anxiety/*psychologyMH  - ChildMH  - *Competitive BehaviorMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Parent-Child RelationsMH  - Personality InventoryMH  - Self ConceptMH  - ShameMH  - *SportsMH  - Stress, Psychological/psychologyMH  - *WrestlingEDAT- 1989/04/01MHDA- 1989/04/01 00:01CRDT- 1989/04/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Med Sci Sports Exerc. 1989 Apr;21(2):221-9.PMID- 2648209OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19890511DCOM- 19890511LR  - 20051116IS  - 0361-1817 (Print)IS  - 0361-1817 (Linking)VI  - 14IP  - 3DP  - 1989 MarTI  - Preventing nervous system sports injuries.PG  - 42, 44-6AB  - Physical fitness and sports remain integral components of overall good health and      a cornerstone of preventive medicine. When performed safely, under adequate      supervision, and with appropriate protective gear, most of these activities are      enjoyable, healthful and psychologically gratifying. When not performed safely by      trained athletes, these same activities can be treacherous, injurious and      permanently disabling. The goals of this article are to review and describe      low-risk and high-risk sports activities. A number of underlying mechanisms      responsible for a particularly alarming amount of morbidity in sports will be      reviewed. Fundamentals of the diagnosis and emergency treatment of many injuries       will be discussed. Most important, a series of steps to be taken to improve upon       sports safety will be outlined.

Occupational choice, professional socialization, and organizational socialization      are examined, using qualitative data drawn from naturally occurring observations       of coaches and informal discussions and in-depth interviews with them. Over 50%      of the coaches had decided that they wanted to become a coach before entrance      into college. The decision to become a coach was subjectively warranted by      personal characteristics and experiences in sports, a devotion to sport, and a      desire to work with young people. Youth sport coaching and student teaching which      involved coaching constituted the only formal professional socialization that      most of the coaches received. However, because almost all of the coaches      participated in organized youth and/or high school athletics, they had a      first-hand opportunity to observe their own coaches and acquire some informal      images and impressions about the coaching occupation from them. Regardless of      whether a neophyte began as an assistant or a head coach, technical aspects of      the job and the occupation's culture were acquired by observing and listening to       more experienced coaches. Through these experiences, collective understandings      began to form, and the shared meanings about the occupational culture took shape.      Reality shock for most novice coaches came in the form of understanding the      importance the coaching culture assigns to long hours and hard work and to the      realization that coaching does take an enormous amount of time. By the end of the      first season, a symbolic transformation takes place and internalization of      institutional expectations occurs as the neophyte begins to understand what      coaching is all about.FAU - Sage, G HAU  - Sage GHAD  - Department of Kinesiology, University of Northern Colorado, Gresley 80639.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPT  - ReviewPL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Res Q Exerc SportJT  - Research quarterly for exercise and sportJID - 8006373SB  - IMMH  - *Career ChoiceMH  - HumansMH  - Physical Education and Training/*manpowerMH  - *SchoolsMH  - SocializationMH  - *Sports/educationRF  - 60EDAT- 1989/03/01MHDA- 1989/03/01 00:01CRDT- 1989/03/01 00:00AID - 10.1080/02701367.1989.10607417 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Res Q Exerc Sport. 1989 Mar;60(1):81-92.PMID- 2909019OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19890126DCOM- 19890126LR  - 20140917IS  - 0098-7484 (Print)IS  - 0098-7484 (Linking)VI  - 261IP  - 2DP  - 1989 Jan 13TI  - Sliding injuries: the third base coach as prophylactic.PG  - 247FAU - McClurken, J BAU  - McClurken JBFAU - Coyle, T JAU  - Coyle TJLA  - engPT  - LetterPL  - UNITED STATESTA  - JAMAJT  - JAMAJID - 7501160SB  - AIMSB  - IMMH  - Athletic Injuries/*prevention & controlMH  - *BaseballMH  - HumansMH  - *SportsEDAT- 1989/01/13MHDA- 1989/01/13 00:01CRDT- 1989/01/13 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - JAMA. 1989 Jan 13;261(2):247.PMID- 22557655OWN - NLMSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINEDA  - 20120504DCOM- 20120823IS  - 0257-7941 (Print)IS  - 0257-7941 (Linking)VI  - 8IP  - 3-4DP  - 1989 JanTI  - Ayuveda'S contribution to sports medicine.PG  - 230-4AB  - Medical Science plays an important role in the field of Sports.

Trainers, EMTs, paramedics, and team physicians should be aware of this       possibility. In addition, athletes who have sustained direct blow and have had      slower bleeding may collapse later either on the field, on the side-lines, or at       home. They will be pale, sweaty, may complain of thirst, and the pulse will be      rapid and thready. If a blow has been sustained that results in abdominal pain,      the athlete should not be given liquids to drink. If he has collapsed or has      diffuse abdominal pain he should be kept in a recumbent position, and the legs      should be elevated in order to assist blood in returning to the heart      (Trendelenberg position). If hypotensive shock is present, the PASG antishock      garment should be applied. In cases in which there is serious concern about an      intra-abdominal injury or the patient has collapsed in shock, transport to a      hospital, preferably to a trauma center, should be effected as rapidly as      possible. There should not be excessive delays in starting intravenous fluids or       administering time-consuming procedures in the field. Truly serious      intra-abdominal injuries as a result of nonvehicular sports-related incidents are      not common. It is precisely for this reason that they are dangerous. Teammates,      parents, trainers, coaches, EMTs, and paramedics are not accustomed to seeing      them with any frequency. Because of this, the early signs of injury are often      unrecognized, even in cases that progress to shock or collapse.(ABSTRACT      TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)FAU - Diamond, D LAU  - Diamond DLAD  - Division of General Surgery, Allegheny General Hospital, Pittsburgh,      Pennsylvania.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Clin Sports MedJT  - Clinics in sports medicineJID - 8112473SB  - IMMH  - Abdominal Injuries/*therapyMH  - Athletic Injuries/*therapyMH  - EmergenciesMH  - HumansMH  - Wounds, Nonpenetrating/therapyMH  - Wounds, Penetrating/therapyRF  - 33EDAT- 1989/01/01MHDA- 1989/01/01 00:01CRDT- 1989/01/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Clin Sports Med. 1989 Jan;8(1):91-9.PMID- 2610034OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19900222DCOM- 19900222LR  - 20041117IS  - 0001-8449 (Print)IS  - 0001-8449 (Linking)VI  - 24IP  - 96DP  - 1989 WinterTI  - Sports competition and its influence on self-esteem development.PG  - 861-9AB  - Competition and its influence upon the adolescent is the primary concern of many       recreational agencies. In the past ten years, many youth agencies have      de-emphasized competition in their programs because of its negative influence      upon self-esteem. There is a need to examine the relationship between competition      and self-esteem so that recreational programs can be better designed to utilize      competition as a positive factor. A study was undertaken to examine self-esteem      in relation to competition in a basketball program. It was found that the coach's      assessments of ability and intention of participation are important factors in      positive self-esteem development. The social aspects of peer interaction and      parent influence also contribute to positive self-esteem. These are minor      elements, however, in comparison to the impact of the coach. There needs to be      intensive training for coaches on how to develop positive self-esteem and how to       deal with the range of participation styles.FAU - Hines, SAU  - Hines SAD  - School of Health, Physical Education and Recreation, Bowling Green State      University, Ohio 43403.FAU - Groves, D LAU  - Groves DLLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - UNITED STATESTA  - AdolescenceJT  - AdolescenceJID - 0123667SB  - IMMH  - AchievementMH  - AdolescentMH  - AssertivenessMH  - *BasketballMH  - Child DevelopmentMH  - *Competitive BehaviorMH  - FamilyMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - LeadershipMH  - MaleMH  - Physical FitnessMH  - *Self ConceptEDAT- 1989/01/01MHDA- 1989/01/01 00:01CRDT- 1989/01/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Adolescence. 1989 Winter;24(96):861-9.PMID- 3217969OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19890228DCOM- 19890228LR  - 20061115IS  - 0167-9228 (Print)IS  - 0167-9228 (Linking)VI  - 19IP  - 6DP  - 1988 DecTI  - [Physical activity and sports as health promoting behavior in middle age].PG  - 289-95AB  - In any preventive health care program for middle aged adults and elderly people,       the promotion of physical fitness activities has become an item of priority.      However, the increased awareness of the importance of being physically fit is in       contrast with the limited number of adults actually involved in physical fitness       activities. This study focuses on the reasons for in-activity as well as on the      perceived motivation to participate in a fitness program. Health was found, as      expected, to be the most important motive to start participation in a physical      fitness program. Even most of the non-active adults believed that for health      reasons they should exercise regularly. Reasons for inactivity included fatigue      and lack of energy, lack of time (other things are more important and enjoyable),      inadequate facilities, experiencing no health difficulties which would indicate      the need for exercise, the implications for their lifestyle and fear of potential      health hazards associated with physical fitness activities. Adherence to habitual      physical activity was motivated by social support and socializing opportunities      and the experience of relaxation, recreation and relief of tension. The      discrepancy between knowing about health and fitness and really participating in       a fitness program is interpreted in terms of cognitive processes, behaviour      modification and changing health life-styles.FAU - Vanden Auweele, YAU  - Vanden Auweele YAD  - Instituut voor Lichamelijke Opleiding, KU-Leu-ven.LA  - dutPT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticleTT  - Lichaamsbeweging en sportbeoefening als gezondheidsbevorderend gedrag op      middelbare leeftijd.PL  - NETHERLANDSTA  - Tijdschr Gerontol GeriatrJT  - Tijdschrift voor gerontologie en geriatrieJID - 8210346SB  - IMMH  - *ExerciseMH  - FemaleMH  - Health BehaviorMH  - *Health PromotionMH  - HumansMH  - Life StyleMH  - MaleMH  - Mental ProcessesMH  - Middle AgedMH  - MotivationMH  - *Physical FitnessMH  - *SportsEDAT- 1988/12/01MHDA- 1988/12/01 00:01CRDT- 1988/12/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Tijdschr Gerontol Geriatr. 1988 Dec;19(6):289-95.PMID- 3071150OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19890503DCOM- 19890503LR  - 20041117IS  - 0363-5465 (Print)IS  - 0363-5465 (Linking)VI  - 16IP  - 6DP  - 1988 Nov-DecTI  - Sport and medicine in ancient Greece.PG  - 594-6AB  - Sport and medicine in ancient Greece were the result of a widespread tradition of      liberty, which was at the heart of one of the most brilliant civilizations in      history. Whereas war encouraged the development of surgical knowledge springing      out of medical experience on the battlefield, peace promoted the burgeoning of      sport as an integral part of Greek upbringing, allowing the channeling of young      people's aggressiveness into physical competition. Medicine was magical and      mythological, especially in the time of Homer (9th century BC); Aesculapius, the       mythical god of healing, was its reference point. With Hippocrates (5th century      BC), the body of medical experience was to be codified and built up, and was to      undergo a novel evolution based on the theory of the balance of the four humors.       The athlete's mentality, faced with trauma in the sports ground, underwent a      change; injury was no longer considered a punishment by the gods. At the same      time, temple offerings tendered in the hope of victory gave way to the athlete's       personal preparation based on a specifically modified lifestyle, diet, and      training. The resulting progress in medicine and public health, especially from      the 5th century BC onward, was not only to favor athletic performances of high      quality but also surgical techniques that were very advanced for their time. Thus      it can be seen that the medical knowledge associated with the practice of sport      progressed during antiquity because of its obligation to follow the warrior and      then the athlete.FAU - Appelboom, TAU  - Appelboom TAD  - Division of Rheumatology, Erasmus University Hospital, Brussels, Belgium.FAU - Rouffin, CAU  - Rouffin CFAU - Fierens, EAU  - Fierens ELA  - engPT  - Historical ArticlePT  - Journal ArticlePL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Am J Sports MedJT  - The American journal of sports medicineJID - 7609541SB  - IMSB  - QMH  - GreeceMH  - History, AncientMH  - HumansMH  - Medicine, TraditionalMH  - Sports/*historyMH  - Sports Medicine/*historyEDAT- 1988/11/01MHDA- 1988/11/01 00:01CRDT- 1988/11/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Am J Sports Med. 1988 Nov-Dec;16(6):594-6.PMID- 3238406OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19890510DCOM- 19890510LR  - 20061115IS  - 0036-7885 (Print)IS  - 0036-7885 (Linking)VI  - 36IP  - 3DP  - 1988 OctTI  - [Interdisciplinary classification analysis in the framework of sports medicine      training guidelines.

The vast multitude of injuries      sustained are mild contusions, sprains, and strains. Major catastrophic injuries       are rare. Overuse injuries secondary to repetitive, unrepaired microtrauma are      becoming a more common source of injury. Children must not be thought of as      simply small adults. Physiologically and emotionally, children, youth, and      adolescents all vary in rate and magnitude of maturation in these spheres. The      vast majority of sports-related injuries in children and adolescents require      neither hospitalization nor surgery but lend themselves to out-patient treatment.      The practice of preventive medicine is encouraged, and orthopedists should take      an active part in advising patients about equipment and training programs to      prevent coach and parental abuses that may lead to musculoskeletal long-term      disabilities.FAU - Stanitski, C LAU  - Stanitski CLAD  - University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pennsylvania.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Orthop Clin North AmJT  - The Orthopedic clinics of North AmericaJID - 0254463SB  - AIMSB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Arm Injuries/therapyMH  - Athletic Injuries/*therapyMH  - Back Pain/therapyMH  - ChildMH  - Fractures, Bone/therapyMH  - HumansMH  - Leg Injuries/therapyMH  - Osteochondritis/therapyRF  - 110EDAT- 1988/10/01MHDA- 1988/10/01 00:01CRDT- 1988/10/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Orthop Clin North Am. 1988 Oct;19(4):689-98.PMID- 3293734OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19880907DCOM- 19880907LR  - 20131121IS  - 0833-1235 (Print)IS  - 0833-1235 (Linking)VI  - 13IP  - 2DP  - 1988 JunTI  - [Profile of childrens' hockey coaches and motives of participation and      resignation].PG  - 157-65AB  - The purpose of this study was twofold: (a) to outline a demographic profile of      Quebec minor hockey coaches and (b) to identify their motives of involvement and       resignation.

They are fathers of at least one boy who is a      hockey player, and they come from all socio-economic strata. They are former      hockey players and are well aware of the activities of the professional teams.      They perceive themselves as being competent coaches and are satisfied with their       results. They highly value hockey as a means of education and perceive their own       role of volunteer as being an unselfish one geared toward youth education. On the      other hand, they perceive the other volunteers' involvement as being      self-interested and mainly due to the child's primary participation.FAU - Spallanzani, CAU  - Spallanzani CAD  - Departement d'education physique, Universite Laval, Ste-Foy, Quebec.LA  - frePT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewTT  - Profil d'entraineurs en hockey mineur et motifs de participation et de demission.PL  - CANADATA  - Can J Sport SciJT  - Canadian journal of sport sciences = Journal canadien des sciences du sportJID - 8707670SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Father-Child RelationsMH  - *HockeyMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - *MotivationMH  - Personal SatisfactionMH  - *Physical Education and TrainingMH  - QuebecMH  - *SportsMH  - VolunteersRF  - 25EDAT- 1988/06/01MHDA- 1988/06/01 00:01CRDT- 1988/06/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Can J Sport Sci. 1988 Jun;13(2):157-65.PMID- 3359362OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19880531DCOM- 19880531LR  - 20041117IS  - 0833-1235 (Print)IS  - 0833-1235 (Linking)VI  - 13IP  - 1DP  - 1988 MarTI  - Decision styles and coaching effectiveness in university soccer.PG  - 56-65AB  - The Normative Model for Decision Styles in Coaching (Chelladurai and Haggerty,      1978) was empirically tested using Canadian Intercollegiate (CIAU) soccer teams.       The subsequent utility of the model's prescriptions for optimizing decision      styles of soccer coaches was seriously questioned. Only 33% agreement was found      with the model's prescriptions for both CIAU coaches and their athletes. Neither       coaches nor athletes were particularly inclined to use delegation in decision      making. Athletes, more than their coaches, preferred consultative styles. In      support of research findings from business and industrial settings, there was      evidence to suggest that high congruence scores between a coach's decision styles      and those preferred and perceived by athletes, could predict athlete perceptions       of coaching effectiveness.FAU - Gordon, SAU  - Gordon SAD  - Department of Human Movement and Recreation Studies, University of Western      Australia, Nedlands.LA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - CANADATA  - Can J Sport SciJT  - Canadian journal of sport sciences = Journal canadien des sciences du sportJID - 8707670SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - CanadaMH  - *Decision MakingMH  - Decision TreesMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - *Models, PsychologicalMH  - *SoccerMH  - *SportsEDAT- 1988/03/01MHDA- 1988/03/01 00:01CRDT- 1988/03/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Can J Sport Sci. 1988 Mar;13(1):56-65.PMID- 3292258OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19880818DCOM- 19880818LR  - 20051116IS  - 0091-6331 (Print)IS  - 0091-6331 (Linking)VI  - 16DP  - 1988TI  - Common and uncommon dermatologic diseases related to sports activities.PG  - 215-53AB  - The athlete is exposed to a whole spectrum of skin diseases that may or may not      be unique to the particular sport or activity.

The reaction ability of      the coach during the exercise and his force capacity to prevent an accident is      explored by a newly developed reaction time analyzer and by a catapult apparatus       throwing a dummy.

Frequently       single or multiple vitamins in combination with other active substances such as      iron, other minerals or carbohydrates are administered. In sports, vitamins are      added to carbohydrate mixtures or electrolytes enriched with vitamins are offered      and frequently used. There is no doubt that due to the numerous effects of      vitamins, a connection must exist between the vitamin status and athletic      performance capability. It can be concluded that vitamin deficiencies have a      negative effect on physical and mental performance. The release of energy can      only attain its maximum output when the organism has the required substances at      its disposal. Iron is of central importance among these active substances, since       its presence in haemoglobin is essential for the transport of oxygen and carbon      dioxide, makes it possible for myoglobin to function as an oxygen supply depot      and guarantees the functioning of internal respiration in the respiratory chain      and various key enzymes. Muscle training increases not only the respiratory chain      but also several other iron-rich enzymes. This makes even more astonishing the      fact that a variety of recently published articles report on iron deficiency      among athletes. The effect of the iron deficiency with anaemia (sports anaemia)      is manifest in a reduction of aerobic capacity with an increase in lactate      acidosis, greater fatigue, loss of appetite, muscular cramps and vasomotor      disturbances.FAU - Keul, JAU  - Keul JFAU - Jakob, EAU  - Jakob EFAU - Berg, AAU  - Berg AFAU - Dickhuth, H HAU  - Dickhuth HHFAU - Lehmann, MAU  - Lehmann MLA  - gerPT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tTT  - Zur Wirkung von Vitaminen und Eisen auf die Leistungs- und Erholungsfahigkeit des      Menschen und die Sportanamie.PL  - GERMANY, WESTTA  - Z ErnahrungswissJT  - Zeitschrift fur ErnahrungswissenschaftJID - 0413632RN  - 0 (Dietary Proteins)RN  - 0 (Vitamins)RN  - E1UOL152H7 (Iron)SB  - IMMH  - Anemia, Hypochromic/*drug therapyMH  - Dietary Proteins/administration & dosageMH  - Energy Metabolism/drug effectsMH  - HumansMH  - Iron/*administration & dosageMH  - Muscle Contraction/drug effectsMH  - Nutritional RequirementsMH  - Physical Education and TrainingMH  - Physical Endurance/drug effectsMH  - *SportsMH  - Vitamins/*administration & dosageEDAT- 1987/03/01MHDA- 1987/03/01 00:01CRDT- 1987/03/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Z Ernahrungswiss. 1987 Mar;26(1):21-42.PMID- 3594317OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19870817DCOM- 19870817LR  - 20061115IS  - 0833-1235 (Print)IS  - 0833-1235 (Linking)VI  - 12IP  - 1DP  - 1987 MarTI  - [The effect of a modification of the rules on the change in the players attitude       toward a sport].PG  - 37-40AB  - The purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of a change of rules in      Ringette on the attitude of the players toward the sport. A total of 332 players       and observers (coaches, officials and parents) completed two attitude scales      dealing with an old and a new rule on zone restriction in Ringette. Results,      (331) = 22.23, p less than .0001, indicate that there has been a change of      attitude in the subjects. The fact that Ringette is played with a new rule (no      zone restriction) seems to be responsible for a more favourable attitude toward      the sport. Reasons explaining this change of attitude are discussed in the paper.FAU - Valois, PAU  - Valois PFAU - Godbout, PAU  - Godbout PLA  - frePT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticleTT  - L'effet d'une modification des regles de jeu sur le changement de l'attitude      envers un sport.PL  - CANADATA  - Can J Sport SciJT  - Canadian journal of sport sciences = Journal canadien des sciences du sportJID - 8707670SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - *AttitudeMH  - ChildMH  - HumansMH  - *SportsEDAT- 1987/03/01MHDA- 1987/03/01 00:01CRDT- 1987/03/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Can J Sport Sci. 1987 Mar;12(1):37-40.PMID- 3572704OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19870609DCOM- 19870609LR  - 20041117IS  - 0022-3506 (Print)IS  - 0022-3506 (Linking)VI  - 55IP  - 1DP  - 1987 MarTI  - Predicting athletic performance with self-confidence and somatic and cognitive      anxiety as a function of motor and physiological requirements in six sports.PG  - 139-53AB  - The purpose of the present study is to examine the ability of certain      psychological attributes to predict performance in six National Collegiate      Athletic Association Division I collegiate sports. Eighty-four athletes from the       varsity sports teams of cross country running, alpine and nordic skiing, tennis,       basketball, and track and field at the University of Colorado completed a      questionnaire adapted from Martens (1977; Martens et al., 1983) that measured      their trait levels of self-confidence (Bandura, 1977), somatic anxiety, and      cognitive anxiety (Martens, 1977; Martens et al., 1983). In addition, at three to      six competitions during the season, the members of the cross country running and       tennis teams filled out a state measure (Martens et al., 1983) of the three      attributes from one to two hours prior to the competition. Following each      competition, subjective and objective ratings of performance were obtained, and,       for all sports, coaches' ratings of performance and an overall seasonal team      ranking were determined as seasonal performance measures. The sports were      dichotomized along motor and physiological dimensions. Results indicate that all       three psychological attributes were significant predictors of performance in both      fine motor, anaerobic sports and gross motor, aerobic sports. Further, clear      differences in these relationships emerged as a function of the dichotomization.       In addition, unexpected sex differences emerged. The findings are discussed      relative to prior research and their implications for future research.FAU - Taylor, JAU  - Taylor JLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - UNITED STATESTA  - J PersJT  - Journal of personalityJID - 2985194RSB  - IMMH  - Anxiety/*psychologyMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Personality InventoryMH  - *Physical EnduranceMH  - *Physical FitnessMH  - *Self ConceptMH  - *SportsEDAT- 1987/03/01MHDA- 1987/03/01 00:01CRDT- 1987/03/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Pers. 1987 Mar;55(1):139-53.PMID- 3815707OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19870330DCOM- 19870330LR  - 20081121IS  - 0700-3978 (Print)IS  - 0700-3978 (Linking)VI  - 11IP  - 4DP  - 1986 DecTI  - Children in competitive sports--a multi-disciplinary approach.PG  - 162-72AB  - This article is divided into two parts: Part 1 consists of the position stand of       The Canadian Association of Applied Sport Sciences on the involvement of children      in competitive sports, and Part II presents scientific background and rationale      pertinent to the position statements. Each part is divided into major categories       reflecting the multi-disciplinary concerns of the participation of pre- and      post-pubescent children in sport situations at all levels. Psychological      considerations focus on the child learning a sense of competence and control      through sport participation. Success in a sport should not be based solely on      winning, but on one's own performance and attained goals. Sport involvement can      provide one important avenue for a child's social development. Non-aggressive      behaviour and a constructive problem-solving approach should be encouraged. Any      form of discrimination towards sport participation or competition should be      discouraged. From the physiological and medical point of view, it should be      recognized that each child is different in his/her response and tolerance to      exercise due to a great range of variability in growth rates, anthropometric      indices, gender and state of health, even in children of a similar chronological       age. Younger prepubertal children should be encouraged to participate in a wide      variety of motor skills, whereas older post-pubertal children can become more      specialized in their training and sport participation. A child's performance and       adaptation to training should not be directly compared to an adult's as      significant differences exist, especially during the years of accelerated growth.      Environmental exercise tolerance is also more limited to children than adults. In      younger children repetitive heavy loading of the musculoskeletal system should be      approached with caution. With proper equipment design and usage, and rule      modifications, serious injuries can be avoided. Medical disabilities should be      evaluated on an individual basis and should not necessarily preclude a child's      participation. Teachers, parents and coaches should have a thorough understanding      of the implications of children involved in sports and adhere to the      recommendations reviewed in this statement.FAU - Hughson, RAU  - Hughson RLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - CANADATA  - Can J Appl Sport SciJT  - Canadian journal of applied sport sciences.

As a result, every effort must be made to provide the athletes      with protection against mouth injuries. In this review the use, construction and       benefits of mouthguards in all sports has been described. There is unanimous      opinion attesting to the benefits of such protective devices and in those sports       where the athlete is required to wear a mouth guard, a dramatic decrease in the      number and severity of injuries has been reported. Custom-fitted mouth guards      should be used in many sports that do not already have a compulsory rule      requiring their use. Physicians, dentists, trainers and coaches need to be      educated on the data supporting the benefits described. Studies on performance      enhancement as a result of mandibular orthopaedic repositioning appliances have      also been reviewed. Long term studies are required to assess the claims of      ergogenic enhancement utilising proper study design.

They should be used for therapeutic indications only. Their      misuse to improve physical performance is unethical (doping), illegal and of      doubtful pharmacological value. Together with intense muscular exercise and      high-protein diet, anabolics due to their anabolic and anti-catabolic actions      possibly increase physical performance and enhance recovery in athletes where      added strength is a great advantage. In most sport disciplines a beneficial      effect has not been demonstrated. Like all active drugs, anabolics can cause      side-effects. They depend on structure, dosage and duration of administration.      The misuse by athletes of high doses during long periods should be a particular      motivation for doctors, teachers and coaches to discourage athletes from using      anabolic drugs. The dangers of overdosing and long-term use are emphasized,      search for untoward side- and after- effects by regular and careful controls is      recommended.FAU - Kopera, HAU  - Kopera HLA  - gerPT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticleTT  - Anabolika und Sport.PL  - AUSTRIATA  - Wien Med WochenschrJT  - Wiener medizinische Wochenschrift (1946)JID - 8708475RN  - 0 (Anabolic Agents)RN  - 0 (Gonadal Steroid Hormones)SB  - IMMH  - Anabolic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic useMH  - FemaleMH  - Gonadal Steroid Hormones/bloodMH  - HumansMH  - Liver/drug effectsMH  - MaleMH  - Muscles/drug effectsMH  - Physical Endurance/drug effectsMH  - Physical FitnessMH  - *SportsEDAT- 1986/09/30MHDA- 1986/09/30 00:01CRDT- 1986/09/30 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Wien Med Wochenschr. 1986 Sep 30;136(18):453-6.PMID- 3779338OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19861223DCOM- 19861223LR  - 20130929IS  - 0306-3674 (Print)IS  - 0306-3674 (Linking)VI  - 20IP  - 3DP  - 1986 SepTI  - Stress inoculation training to control anxiety in sport: two case studies in      squash.PG  - 115-7AB  - This study arose as a result of two squash players, one male one female, seeking       advice on how to improve their mental approach to playing. They both felt that      their game suffered badly through too much anxiety. After preliminary interviews       it was decided to use a programme of stress inoculation training to help them      learn to control their anxiety. In order to obtain baseline measures of anxiety,       both subjects completed a state anxiety questionnaire on five occasions,      immediately prior to playing important league or team matches. They were then      given eight training sessions. On completion of the training, subjects were asked      to complete a further five state anxiety tests immediately prior to analogous      matches. There was a considerable decrease in self-reported anxiety levels and      both players reported that their performance had improved. It is argued that      stress inoculation training is potentially very useful as a technique for      controlling anxiety in certain competitive sports.FAU - Mace, RAU  - Mace RFAU - Carroll, DAU  - Carroll DLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - ENGLANDTA  - Br J Sports MedJT  - British journal of sports medicineJID - 0432520SB  - IMMH  - Adaptation, PsychologicalMH  - Anxiety/prevention & control/*psychologyMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - *SportsMH  - Stress, Psychological/*prevention & controlPMC - PMC1478376OID - NLM: PMC1478376EDAT- 1986/09/01MHDA- 1986/09/01 00:01CRDT- 1986/09/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Br J Sports Med. 1986 Sep;20(3):115-7.PMID- 3526508OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19860925DCOM- 19860925LR  - 20041117IS  - 0112-1642 (Print)IS  - 0112-1642 (Linking)VI  - 3IP  - 4DP  - 1986 Jul-AugTI  - Viral illnesses and sports performance.PG  - 298-303AB  - Viruses are ubiquitous and cause numerous infections in humans. These may vary      from asymptomatic infection to severe debilitating illness. Viruses enter the      host cells to replicate, using host synthetic mechanisms, and, thus, are      resistant to conventional antibiotics. The human body responds to viral infection      by synthesising specific antibody which can be used to aid diagnosis. Infectious       mononucleosis (glandular fever) commonly affects the 15 to 30 years age group. It      may produce severe debility which may last a month or more. Coxsackie virus      infection can produce symptoms of the common cold but may also invade heart      muscle and produce myocarditis, a potentially serious disease. Other viruses also      produce a wide spectrum of disease. Recent evidence has shown that people      undergoing severe mental or physical stress may have reduced immunity to viral      infections. There are risks associated with strenuous physical activity during      the acute phase of viral infection, and there are reports of sudden death and      serious complications occurring in previously fit young adults who undertake      vigorous exercise when in the acute phase of a viral illness. Abnormalities of      skeletal muscle have been demonstrated in patients with viral infection and this       may explain the loss of performance experienced by athletes after upper      respiratory tract infection. As a general rule, for all but mild common colds, it      is advised that the athlete avoids hard training for the first month after      infection.FAU - Roberts, J AAU  - Roberts JALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - NEW ZEALANDTA  - Sports MedJT  - Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)JID - 8412297SB  - IMMH  - Coxsackievirus Infections/complications/*physiopathologyMH  - Death, Sudden/etiologyMH  - HumansMH  - Infectious Mononucleosis/complications/*physiopathologyMH  - Physical Education and TrainingMH  - RiskMH  - Splenic Rupture/etiologyMH  - *SportsMH  - Virus Diseases/etiology/immunologyMH  - Virus ReplicationRF  - 50EDAT- 1986/07/01MHDA- 1986/07/01 00:01CRDT- 1986/07/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Sports Med. 1986 Jul-Aug;3(4):298-303.PMID- 3698161OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19860527DCOM- 19860527LR  - 20080226IS  - 0700-3978 (Print)IS  - 0700-3978 (Linking)VI  - 11IP  - 1DP  - 1986 MarTI  - The real time analysis of sport: an overview.PG  - 55-7AB  - This paper describes a specific system analytic approach to the coaching and      teaching of team sports.

A review.PG  - 316-33AB  - Because knowledge of overuse syndromes is limited, the diagnosis and treatment of      these conditions are a challenge to sports medicine physicians. Trial and error      methods of treatment and too little attention to basic research have resulted in       less than optimum solutions. We do know that these maladies most frequently      result from overload or repetitive microtrauma stemming from extrinsic factors      such as training errors, poor performance, poor techniques and inappropriate      surfaces or intrinsic factors including malalignment and muscle imbalance.      Overuse injuries involving the muscles include compartment syndromes and muscle      soreness; while those involving the tendons result from a variety of degenerative      and inflammatory processes. Overstress of bone results in stress fractures,      apophysitis and periostitis. Bursitis and joint overstress problems are also      discussed briefly. General guidelines for establishing the appropriate diagnosis       are: the initial stages of therapy require rest, often a modification or scaled      down exposure to the athlete's usual performance rather than complete abstinence;      in acutely symptomatic cases pain medications and various measures to control      inflammation may be necessary; an exercise programme should start early with      range of motion exercises and isometric muscle contractions; when pain allows,      dynamic muscle and flexibility exercises can resume together with a conditioning       programme; if possible, eccentric exercises should be performed. The treatment      may also include other conservative treatment modalities and surgery in special      cases. Overuse injuries constitute a great diagnostic and therapeutic problem      because the symptoms are often diffuse and uncharacteristic. An appropriate      diagnosis followed by adequate treatment can improve or eliminate most of these      conditions, but perhaps even more importantly a proper understanding of overuse      syndromes should allow physicians to assist athletes, trainers, and coaches in      preventing them.FAU - Renstrom, PAU  - Renstrom PFAU - Johnson, R JAU  - Johnson RJLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - NEW ZEALANDTA  - Sports MedJT  - Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)JID - 8412297SB  - IMMH  - Achilles Tendon/injuries/physiopathologyMH  - Athletic Injuries/epidemiology/etiology/*physiopathology/therapyMH  - Bone and Bones/injuriesMH  - Bursitis/physiopathologyMH  - HumansMH  - Joints/injuriesMH  - Muscular Diseases/physiopathologyMH  - Periostitis/physiopathologyMH  - Tendinopathy/physiopathologyMH  - Tendon Injuries/diagnosis/physiopathology/rehabilitation/therapyRF  - 110EDAT- 1985/09/01MHDA- 1985/09/01 00:01CRDT- 1985/09/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Sports Med. 1985 Sep-Oct;2(5):316-33.PMID- 3157650OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19850618DCOM- 19850618LR  - 20081121IS  - 0172-4622 (Print)IS  - 0172-4622 (Linking)VI  - 6IP  - 1DP  - 1985 FebTI  - Basic neurophysiology of motor skills in sport: a review.PG  - 2-14AB  - The broad spectrum of skills in sport, with their high demands on strength,      speed, endurance, coordination, and flexibility, represents one of the greatest      challenges to human motor performances. However, the basic neurophysiological      mechanisms in sport are not principally different from those in everyday motor      acts. This review describes some of the relevant neurophysiological facts in a      comprehensive frame, with emphasis on new findings and changes of traditional      concepts. Going from simple to increasingly complex processes, the following      chapters, each with several subtopics, will be treated: peripheral and spinal      building blocks of motoricity; elementary grammar of the spinal cord; some      aspects of spinal/supraspinal coordination in the brainstem; achievements and      problems of cerebral motor control; and principles of motor learning in sport. In      conclusion, the recent progress in neurophysiological research on motor systems      allows recognition of a substantially new trend, a change of "paradigms": old      mechanistic concepts of reflex chains and motor functions, like a complicated      automation, are increasingly replaced by the idea of a sensing, planning, and      self-operating subject whose mental processes are decisive for motor behavior,      particularly in sport. Further mutual stimulation and support can be expected      from this development between the science of sport and that of neuro- and      psychophysiology.FAU - Henatsch, H DAU  - Henatsch HDFAU - Langer, H HAU  - Langer HHLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - GERMANY, WESTTA  - Int J Sports MedJT  - International journal of sports medicineJID - 8008349SB  - IMSB  - SMH  - Basal Ganglia/physiologyMH  - Brain Stem/physiologyMH  - Cerebellum/physiologyMH  - FeedbackMH  - Golgi Apparatus/physiologyMH  - HumansMH  - Interneurons/physiologyMH  - LearningMH  - Motor Cortex/physiologyMH  - Motor Neurons/physiologyMH  - Motor Skills/*physiologyMH  - MovementMH  - Muscle Spindles/physiologyMH  - Muscles/innervationMH  - *Nervous System Physiological PhenomenaMH  - Neural InhibitionMH  - Neurons, Afferent/physiologyMH  - PostureMH  - Psychomotor Performance/*physiologyMH  - Pyramidal Tracts/physiologyMH  - Reflex, StretchMH  - Reticular Formation/physiologyMH  - *Sports MedicineMH  - Vestibule, Labyrinth/physiologyRF  - 48EDAT- 1985/02/01MHDA- 1985/02/01 00:01CRDT- 1985/02/01 00:00AID - 10.1055/s-2008-1025805 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Int J Sports Med. 1985 Feb;6(1):2-14.PMID- 3984816OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19850503DCOM- 19850503LR  - 20041117IS  - 0001-8449 (Print)IS  - 0001-8449 (Linking)VI  - 20IP  - 77DP  - 1985 SpringTI  - The influence of socializing agents in the female sport-participation process.PG  - 73-82AB  - This study investigated the influence of socializing agents on the female      athletes who participated in the Empire State Games in Syracuse, New York (N =      587). When comparisons were made across life-cycle states (under-13, junior high,      and senior high), it was discovered that statistically significant differences      existed (p less than 0.0001). It was apparent that the socializing agent      influences changed from being mostly parental at the under-13 life-cycle stage to      mostly coach/teacher oriented during junior and senior high school years. No      significant differences occurred across the three life-cycle stages when the      following items were examined: (a) the number of sports in which the female      athletes participated, (b) the number of sports learned by the female athletes,      and (c) the amount of sport interest developed. It was concluded that socializing      agent influences do exist, but change during different periods in the life cycle.FAU - Higginson, D CAU  - Higginson DCLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - UNITED STATESTA  - AdolescenceJT  - AdolescenceJID - 0123667SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Adolescent BehaviorMH  - ChildMH  - Child BehaviorMH  - Child DevelopmentMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - ParentsMH  - Peer GroupMH  - *SocializationMH  - *SportsMH  - TeachingEDAT- 1985/01/01MHDA- 1985/01/01 00:01CRDT- 1985/01/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Adolescence. 1985 Spring;20(77):73-82.PMID- 2937756OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19860428DCOM- 19860428LR  - 20061115IS  - 0018-022X (Print)IS  - 0018-022X (Linking)VI  - 40IP  - 6DP  - 1985TI  - [The pediatrician and sports].PG  - 425-34AB  - In contrast to recreative sports, competition should not be allowed in children      without regulations and supervision. Physical handicaps should be carefully      looked for through a thorough pre-participation examination and appropriate      physical activities should be defined for handicapped children. Hypoactivity,      fear of accident and functional deterioration cause more damage to these children      than physical training which may include competition provided the underlying      disease is adequately treated. Regular physical exercise appears to provide      significant physical and psychological benefits which are effective beyond the      period of physical activity. Stress and aggressivity linked to competition do not      seem to have harmful effects on child mental health, with an exception for elite       adolescent athletes for whom more information is needed. These athletes are at      risk for orthopaedic lesions by overuse as well as disturbances of cardiac and      endocrine functions which may disqualify them temporarily for sport events.      Treatments designed to boost performance such as anabolic steroids, amphetamines       or blood transfusions should be strictly forbidden.FAU - Theintz, G EAU  - Theintz GELA  - frePT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticleTT  - Le pediatre face au sport.PL  - SWITZERLANDTA  - Helv Paediatr ActaJT  - Helvetica paediatrica actaJID - 0373005SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - ChildMH  - Competitive BehaviorMH  - Disabled PersonsMH  - HumansMH  - Mental HealthMH  - *Physical Education and TrainingMH  - Physical ExaminationMH  - *Physical FitnessMH  - *SportsEDAT- 1985/01/01MHDA- 1985/01/01 00:01CRDT- 1985/01/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Helv Paediatr Acta. 1985;40(6):425-34.PMID- 2857802OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19850325DCOM- 19850325LR  - 20081121IS  - 0025-7125 (Print)IS  - 0025-7125 (Linking)VI  - 69IP  - 1DP  - 1985 JanTI  - Medical psychology in exercise and sport.PG  - 123-43AB  - Several psychological outcomes that accompany acute and chronic exercise have      medical significance. Transient reductions in somatic tension and subjective      anxiety appear most reliable. Symptom abatement in moderate depression can occur       with chronic exercise in a manner comparable to psychotherapy and may offer a      better prognosis in some instances. Other cognitive, behavioral, and perceptual      events associated with exercise may assist in managing mental health, and      exercise has been successfully used as a therapeutic adjunct in a variety of      psychiatric disorders. Regular exercise may also complement treatments designed      to manage aspects of coronary-prone behavior and psychoendocrine responsivity to       mental stress. The lack of strict experimental control or effective placebo      contrasts in most exercise studies precludes a convincing argument that exercise       causes the psychological outcomes observed. Rather, expectancy of benefits,      generalized treatment or attention effects, social reinforcement, and past      history or selection bias represent likely alternatives. These competing      explanations do not discount, however, that many individuals benefit in a      clinically significant way. Exercise offers a low-cost alternative or adjunct      with side effects that appear largely health-related. Although the effective      psychological dosage or modality has not been quantified, current physiologic      guidelines of the American College of Sports Medicine (large muscle rhythmic      activity, for 20 to 60 minutes, 3 to 5 days per week at 60 to 80 per cent      age-adjusted maximal heart rate), or a weekly caloric cost of 2000 kcal, should      be effective with little medical risk. However, no evidence confirms that an      increase in metabolic or psychoendocrine tolerance to exercise is necessary or      sufficient for psychological outcomes to occur. Although biologic adaptations are      known to follow exercise training and subside with diminished activity, there is       currently no objective evidence that habitual exercise leads to dependence. If      exercise has use in managing subjective or somatic symptoms, these may return      during periods of exercise abstinence. Moreover, despite popular hypotheses      concerning endorphins and biogenic amines, no direct relationships have yet been       shown between exercise-induced mood swings and peripheral biochemical events. A      proportion of habitual runners have reported acute episodes of euphoria-like      states during or following exercise, but this remains a subjective and      unpredictable event that may be related to psychophysiologic relaxation or acute       changes in self-esteem.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)FAU - Dishman, R KAU  - Dishman RKLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - ReviewPL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Med Clin North AmJT  - The Medical clinics of North AmericaJID - 2985236RRN  - 0 (Neurotransmitter Agents)SB  - AIMSB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - CognitionMH  - Competitive BehaviorMH  - Depressive Disorder/prevention & controlMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Mental Disorders/therapyMH  - *Mental HealthMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Neurotransmitter Agents/metabolismMH  - PersonalityMH  - *Physical ExertionMH  - RelaxationMH  - *SportsMH  - Stress, PsychologicalRF  - 208EDAT- 1985/01/01MHDA- 1985/01/01 00:01CRDT- 1985/01/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Med Clin North Am. 1985 Jan;69(1):123-43.PMID- 10279134OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19861218DCOM- 19861218LR  - 20060710IS  - 0275-9632 (Print)IS  - 0275-9632 (Linking)IP  - 20DP  - 1985TI  - Youth sports clinic.

Preferred coaching      behaviour (PCB) was measured using a version of the Leadership Scale for Sports      (Chelladurai and Saleh, 1978, 1980). Preference scores were analyzed on the basis      of sex, age, nationality, and type of sport. A MANOVA indicated that males prefer      significantly more Autocratic behaviour than females (p = .039). Also, athletes      in team sports prefer significantly more Training behaviour (p = .001),      Autocratic behaviour (p less than .001), and Rewarding behaviour (p = .017), and       significantly less Democratic behaviour (p less than .001) and Social Support      behaviour (p = .002) than athletes in individual sports. No significant      differences in PCB attributable to the age or nationally of the athlete were      found. In addition, data collected in a previous study (Terry and Howe, 1984),      which examined the PCB of 'club' athletes, was included to facilitate a      comparison of club v elite athletes. A MANOVA showed that elite athletes prefer      significantly more Democratic behaviour (p = .01) and Social Support behaviour (p      = .001), and significantly less Rewarding behaviour (p = .01) than athletes at a       'club' level. Although differences between subject groups were found, it can be      concluded that athletes generally tend to favour coaches who "often" display      Training behaviour and Rewarding behaviour, "occasionally" display Democratic      behaviour and Social Support behaviour, and "seldom" display Autocratic      behaviour.FAU - Terry, P CAU  - Terry PCLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - CANADATA  - Can J Appl Sport SciJT  - Canadian journal of applied sport sciences.

In addition, it attempted to assess the applicability to sport of the Life-cycle       and Path-goal theories of leadership. Comparisons between groups were made on the      basis of sex, age, and type of sport. A MANOVA indicated that athletes in      independent sports preferred more democratic behaviour (p less than .001) and      less autocratic behaviour (p = .028) than athletes in interdependent sports. No      differences in coaching preferences were found which could be attributed to the      age or sex of the athlete, or the variability of the sports task. These results      partially supported the Path-goal theory, but did not support the Life-cycle      theory. Athletes of all groups tended to favour coaches who displayed training      behaviour and rewarding behaviour "often", democratic behaviour and social      support behaviour "occasionally", and autocratic behaviour "seldom". This      consistency may be a useful finding for those organizations and institutions      interested in preparing coaches.FAU - Terry, P CAU  - Terry PCFAU - Howe, B LAU  - Howe BLLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - CANADATA  - Can J Appl Sport SciJT  - Canadian journal of applied sport sciences.

How to recognize and deal with some      common problems.PG  - 45-50AB  - Upper extremity syndromes caused by a single stress or by repetitive microtrauma       occur in a variety of sports. The throwing motion, long-distance swimming,      bowling, golf, gymnastics, basketball, volleyball, and field events can      repetitively stress the hand, wrist, elbow, and shoulder. The biomechanical      evaluation of racquet handling, throwing, and swimming motions has progressed      considerably, and the future looks promising for better identification and      prevention of sports injuries due to stress. These insights will help the      physician more adequately understand and treat athletic injuries. As for the      present, we must recognize athletic injuries for what they are--debilitating      single or repetitive trauma to active persons who want a rapid return to their      sport. The goal of both the injured athlete and the treating physician must be      100% recovery; compromise in treatment is not warranted. To achieve the best      results, the physician should emphasize to the athlete, coach, and parent that      healing is a matter of time.FAU - Cooney, W P 3rdAU  - Cooney WP 3rdLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Postgrad MedJT  - Postgraduate medicineJID - 0401147SB  - AIMSB  - IMMH  - *Arm Injuries/diagnosis/therapyMH  - *Athletic Injuries/diagnosis/therapyMH  - Fractures, Bone/diagnosis/therapyMH  - Hand Injuries/diagnosis/therapyMH  - HumansMH  - SkiingMH  - Tendinopathy/diagnosis/therapyMH  - TennisMH  - Tennis Elbow/diagnosis/therapyMH  - Thumb/injuriesMH  - Wrist Injuries/diagnosis/therapyEDAT- 1984/09/15MHDA- 1984/09/15 00:01CRDT- 1984/09/15 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Postgrad Med. 1984 Sep 15;76(4):45-50.PMID- 6728048OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19840629DCOM- 19840629LR  - 20061115IS  - 0028-2162 (Print)IS  - 0028-2162 (Linking)VI  - 128IP  - 18DP  - 1984 May 5TI  - [Cardiac rehabilitation: a 5-year follow-up study of mental functioning, work      resumption, smoking habits and sports activities].PG  - 846-51FAU - Erdman, R AAU  - Erdman RAFAU - Duivenvoorden, H JAU  - Duivenvoorden HJFAU - Verhage, FAU  - Verhage FFAU - Kazemier, MAU  - Kazemier MFAU - Hugenholtz, P GAU  - Hugenholtz PGLA  - dutPT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticleTT  - Hartrevalidatie: een vervolgonderzoek over 5 jaar naar psychisch functioneren,      werkhervatting, rookgewoonten en sportieve activiteiten.PL  - NETHERLANDSTA  - Ned Tijdschr GeneeskdJT  - Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskundeJID - 0400770SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Follow-Up StudiesMH  - HumansMH  - *Mental HealthMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Myocardial Infarction/psychology/*rehabilitationMH  - NetherlandsMH  - Psychological TestsMH  - *SmokingMH  - *SportsMH  - *WorkEDAT- 1984/05/05MHDA- 1984/05/05 00:01CRDT- 1984/05/05 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd. 1984 May 5;128(18):846-51.PMID- 6643881OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19840107DCOM- 19840107LR  - 20081121IS  - 0002-8223 (Print)IS  - 0002-8223 (Linking)VI  - 83IP  - 6DP  - 1983 DecTI  - Nutrition knowledge of high school athletic coaches in Texas.PG  - 672-4, 677AB  - A study was conducted by mail questionnaire to assess concepts of nutrition as      related to athletes that coaches in Texas accept and are likely to disseminate.

Specifically, 249 coaches with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4       and 5 levels of certification in the National Coaching Certification Program for       Hockey were compared on attitudes toward important social psychological      correlates of athletic involvement. As a consequence of anomalies in the sample,       the six levels of certification were collapsed to form a factorial design      comprising 2 levels of certification (coaches with 0.1 and 2 levels versus      coaches with 3, 4, and 5 levels) and 2 levels of competition (house league versus      competitive league coaches). The results revealed that coaches with greater      certification were older and more experienced. Also, coaches in competitive      leagues were more experienced, attached more importance to setting realistic      objectives and playing well, but less importance to providing a recreational      experience for players than house league coaches. Also, with increasing      certification, coaches in competitive leagues attached increased importance to      beating an opponent and having a winning team while house league coaches showed a      decrease. Finally, the emphasis planed upon providing equal ice time for all      players remained low over the two levels of certification in the competitive      league coaches; it showed a decrease with greater certification in the house      league coaches.FAU - Graham, R HAU  - Graham RHFAU - Carron, A VAU  - Carron AVLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - CANADATA  - Can J Appl Sport SciJT  - Canadian journal of applied sport sciences.

First and foremost, the disabled athlete as an amateur      athlete with a desire to participate must ever be uppermost in our minds, hearts,      and planning. It appears that one of our chief objectives within the U.S.O.C.      should be a central unifying force operating with joint support of the Sports      Medicine Council and the Handicapped in Sports Committee, under the Sports      Medicine Division. This arrangement will serve as an information and clearing      center for the better understanding of each other and each organization of sports      for the disabled athletes. We need to identify and classify for attention the      common problems inherent among these groups and coordinate our various efforts.      Fundamental to improvement in the application of sports medicine concepts is      development of a definite plan for the education of voluntary coaches and trained      or professionally prepared coaches, athletic trainers, physical therapists, and      physicians. A variety of concurrent approaches are feasible with initiative and      sharing of resources. An additional venture must be to begin pooling and      computerizing our present and future information in this regard (professional      articles and medical records) within the U.S.O.C. information retrieval system.      This must be systematized so the pertinent information can then the disseminated       and furnished nationwide to anyone or any group dealing with the disabled athlete      in sports. Ultimately, our objective is to make this information available to all      handicapped people.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)FAU - Stewart, M JAU  - Stewart MJLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Clin Sports MedJT  - Clinics in sports medicineJID - 8112473SB  - IMMH  - Athletic Injuries/prevention & controlMH  - *Disabled PersonsMH  - Human RightsMH  - HumansMH  - Paraplegia/physiopathologyMH  - Physical Education and Training/methodsMH  - Physical ExertionMH  - *SportsMH  - United StatesEDAT- 1983/03/01MHDA- 1983/03/01 00:01CRDT- 1983/03/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Clin Sports Med. 1983 Mar;2(1):183-90.PMID- 6827957OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19830415DCOM- 19830415LR  - 20081121IS  - 0025-8512 (Print)IS  - 0025-8512 (Linking)VI  - 34IP  - 2DP  - 1983 Jan 14TI  - [Mental stress and sports.

Post-season attitude and self-esteem data were obtained from       players on 23 teams and were related to the behavioral measures. Compared with      rates of reinforcement, encouragement, and technical instruction, punitive      responses occurred relatively infrequently. Factor analysis of the coaching      behaviors indicated that supportive and punitive behavioral dimensions were      orthogonal or statistically independent of one another rather than opposite ends       of the same dimension. Punitive and instructional categories were part of the      same behavior cluster. The relationship between coaching behaviors and the      various player attitudes were highly specific in nature. Coaching behaviors      accounted for about half of the variance in post-season attitudes toward the      coach and the sport, but for significantly less variance in measures of team      solidarity and self-esteem. Surprisingly, the rate of positive reinforcement was       unrelated to any of the attitudinal measures. Punishment was negatively related      to liking for the coach. In general, technical instruction categories were the      strongest predictors of basketball player attitudes.FAU - Smith, R EAU  - Smith REFAU - Zane, N WAU  - Zane NWFAU - Smoll, F LAU  - Smoll FLFAU - Coppel, D BAU  - Coppel DBLA  - engGR  - MH-24248/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.PL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Med Sci Sports ExercJT  - Medicine and science in sports and exerciseJID - 8005433SB  - IMSB  - SMH  - AdultMH  - *AttitudeMH  - *BehaviorMH  - ChildMH  - *Child BehaviorMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - ProbabilityMH  - PunishmentMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - Regression AnalysisMH  - Reinforcement (Psychology)MH  - Self ConceptMH  - *SportsEDAT- 1983/01/01MHDA- 1983/01/01 00:01CRDT- 1983/01/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Med Sci Sports Exerc. 1983;15(3):208-14.PMID- 7152285OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19830311DCOM- 19830311LR  - 20041117IS  - 0016-9900 (Print)IS  - 0016-9900 (Linking)IP  - 11DP  - 1982 NovTI  - [Intellectual work capacity of students in relation to their specialization in      sports].PG  - 82-3FAU - Emets, A IAU  - Emets AILA  - rusPT  - Journal ArticleTT  - Issledovanie umstvennoi rabotosposobnosti studentov v sviazi s ikh sportivnoi      spetsializatsiei.PL  - USSRTA  - Gig SanitJT  - Gigiena i sanitariiaJID - 0412700SB  - IMMH  - AchievementMH  - HumansMH  - Mental Processes/*physiologyMH  - Physical Education and TrainingMH  - SportsMH  - *Sports MedicineMH  - UkraineEDAT- 1982/11/01MHDA- 1982/11/01 00:01CRDT- 1982/11/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Gig Sanit. 1982 Nov;(11):82-3.PMID- 7105786OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19821012DCOM- 19821012LR  - 20081121IS  - 0165-005X (Print)IS  - 0165-005X (Linking)VI  - 6IP  - 1DP  - 1982 MarTI  - On the meaning of sports: cross cultural observations of super stress.PG  - 11-28AB  - The definition of sports medicine indicates the possible therapeutic and research      importance of games in the work of social scientists and clinicians. A      cross-cultural comparison of super stressful competitions provides one insight      into the importance of games in human societies. Fourteen such comparisons are      made between Indians in Mexico who run 250-mile foot races and Americans in      Alaska who conduct 1049-mile dog sled races. It is concluded that sports can help      understand how a society defines itself and regulates violence. Games may be an      essential "human-specific' need which provide entertainment, retain survival      skills, ameliorate existential anxiety and promote religious and/or secular      socialization. In this study, humans seem willing, if not insistent, to deploy      considerable resources of time and material to sustain competitions among their      own species, as well as between and with other species. A "sports history' is      important for all individuals.FAU - Pierce, C MAU  - Pierce CMFAU - Stillner, VAU  - Stillner VFAU - Popkin, MAU  - Popkin MLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - NETHERLANDSTA  - Cult Med PsychiatryJT  - Culture, medicine and psychiatryJID - 7707467SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - AlaskaMH  - *Cross-Cultural ComparisonMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Medicine, TraditionalMH  - MexicoMH  - Middle AgedMH  - RunningMH  - *SportsMH  - Stress, Physiological/*psychologyMH  - ViolenceEDAT- 1982/03/01MHDA- 1982/03/01 00:01CRDT- 1982/03/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Cult Med Psychiatry. 1982 Mar;6(1):11-28.PMID- 7084706OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19820807DCOM- 19820807LR  - 20061115IS  - 0016-9900 (Print)IS  - 0016-9900 (Linking)IP  - 3DP  - 1982 MarTI  - [Hygienic basis of the lesson regimen for young soccer players in the sports      classes of general education schools].PG  - 26-9FAU - Sukharev, A GAU  - Sukharev AGFAU - Adambekov, K IAU  - Adambekov KILA  - rusPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticleTT  - Gigienicheskoe obosnovanie rezhima zaniatii iunykh futbolistov v sportivnykh      klassakh obshcheobrazovatel'nykh shkol.PL  - USSRTA  - Gig SanitJT  - Gigiena i sanitariiaJID - 0412700SB  - IMMH  - Central Nervous System/physiologyMH  - ChildMH  - HumansMH  - Learning/*physiologyMH  - Mental Processes/physiologyMH  - MoscowMH  - Physical Education and TrainingMH  - Reaction Time/physiologyMH  - *SoccerMH  - *SportsMH  - *Sports MedicineEDAT- 1982/03/01MHDA- 1982/03/01 00:01CRDT- 1982/03/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Gig Sanit. 1982 Mar;(3):26-9.PMID- 6917555OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19820527DCOM- 19820527LR  - 20041117IS  - 0106-8350 (Print)IS  - 0106-8350 (Linking)VI  - 82IP  - 8DP  - 1982 Feb 24TI  - [Sports and music are a real part in treatment].PG  - 8-9FAU - Nielsen, EAU  - Nielsen ELA  - danPT  - Journal ArticleTT  - Sport og musik vaesentligt led i behandlingen.PL  - DENMARKTA  - SygeplejerskenJT  - SygeplejerskenJID - 0421366SB  - NMH  - CubaMH  - HumansMH  - Mental Disorders/*rehabilitationMH  - *Music TherapyMH  - *SportsEDAT- 1982/02/24MHDA- 1982/02/24 00:01CRDT- 1982/02/24 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Sygeplejersken. 1982 Feb 24;82(8):8-9.PMID- 6958036OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19821218DCOM- 19821218LR  - 20141120IS  - 0301-7311 (Print)IS  - 0301-7311 (Linking)VI  - 29DP  - 1982TI  - The relationship of sport in childhood and adolescence to mental and social      health.PG  - 135-45AB  - This article examines sport in childhood and adolescence in relation to mental      and social health.

A significant reduction or total elimination of these injuries can be      expected when mouthguards are used. An acceptable custom-made mouthguard can be      constructed for every adolescent; therefore, they can and should be used in      contact sport at junior level. This will help young people to become accustomed      to these protective devices at an early age. It is important that first      mouthguards are comfortable and that adaptations are done whenever needed to      ensure that the recipients will want to continue to use these devices. Sports      bodies and coaches should do more to enforce the use of mouthguards at all      levels. The high incidence of injuries to the oral region makes their use      essential. The time has now come for the use of mouthguards to be made compulsory      by contact sports authorities, first, for all senior teams, and subsequently for       high school and even primary school pupils. Most parents and many dentists are      still unaware of injury hazards and (more importantly) the protection available.       A team dentist, where there is a possibility of dental injury, is the ideal      situation. One dentist can easily be the team dentist for a number of teams,      acting as professional adviser, fitting and adjusting mouthguards and ensuring      that trauma (or dental disease) is treated by the player's own dentist.FAU - de Wet, F AAU  - de Wet FALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - ENGLANDTA  - Int Dent JJT  - International dental journalJID - 0374714SB  - DSB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Athletic Injuries/*prevention & controlMH  - AttitudeMH  - ChildMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - *Mouth Protectors/adverse effectsMH  - *Tooth InjuriesEDAT- 1981/12/01MHDA- 1981/12/01 00:01CRDT- 1981/12/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Int Dent J. 1981 Dec;31(4):313-9.PMID- 6458108OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19820128DCOM- 19820128LR  - 20140912IS  - 0256-9574 (Print)VI  - 60IP  - 22DP  - 1981 Nov 28TI  - Sport and recreation for the severely disabled.PG  - 868-71AB  - A classification of sport and recreation and an explanation of the term      "severely" disabled are given, as well as the physical, psychological, social and      work attributes of sport and the problems experienced by the disabled in these      areas.

Skilled players were found to have      significantly lower cholesterol and noradrenaline levels than less skilled      players whether the games were won or lost. Adrenaline and SUA levels did not      differ between the two groups nor between losing or winning outcomes. The      elevated cholesterol and noradrenaline levels found among the less skilled      players may indicate that although they were stressed by the discrepancy between       their expectations and their performance, they nonetheless maintained perceived      control over performance because of the social support and reinforcement received      from the other players and the coach.FAU - Biersner, R JAU  - Biersner RJFAU - McHugh, W BAU  - McHugh WBFAU - Rahe, R HAU  - Rahe RHLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.PL  - UNITED STATESTA  - J Human StressJT  - Journal of human stressJID - 7602457RN  - 268B43MJ25 (Uric Acid)RN  - 97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)RN  - X4W3ENH1CV (Norepinephrine)RN  - YKH834O4BH (Epinephrine)SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - *BaseballMH  - Cholesterol/*bloodMH  - Epinephrine/*urineMH  - HumansMH  - Interpersonal RelationsMH  - MaleMH  - Norepinephrine/*urineMH  - *SportsMH  - *Sports MedicineMH  - Stress, Psychological/blood/urineMH  - Uric Acid/*bloodEDAT- 1981/09/01MHDA- 1981/09/01 00:01CRDT- 1981/09/01 00:00AID - 10.1080/0097840X.1981.9936827 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Human Stress. 1981 Sep;7(3):12-7.PMID- 7016358OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19810820DCOM- 19810820LR  - 20081121IS  - 0700-3978 (Print)IS  - 0700-3978 (Linking)VI  - 6IP  - 2DP  - 1981 JunTI  - Continuous vs. interval training: a review for the athlete and the coach.PG  - 93-7AB  - Both interval and continuous training are necessary in order to maximize the      endurance athlete's potential for competition.

The importance of the sportsman's mental attitude is stressed.FAU - Adams, I DAU  - Adams IDLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - ENGLANDTA  - Br J Sports MedJT  - British journal of sports medicineJID - 0432520SB  - IMMH  - *Athletic Injuries/etiology/prevention & control/therapyMH  - EuropeMH  - HumansMH  - *Sports MedicinePMC - PMC1859065OID - NLM: PMC1859065EDAT- 1981/03/01MHDA- 1981/03/01 00:01CRDT- 1981/03/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Br J Sports Med. 1981 Mar;15(1):49-50.PMID- 7232867OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19810709DCOM- 19810709LR  - 20061115IS  - 0270-1367 (Print)IS  - 0270-1367 (Linking)VI  - 52IP  - 1DP  - 1981 MarTI  - Trends in the selection of coaches for female athletes: a demographic inquiry.PG  - 9-18FAU - Holmen, M GAU  - Holmen MGFAU - Parkhouse, B LAU  - Parkhouse BLLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Res Q Exerc SportJT  - Research quarterly for exercise and sportJID - 8006373SB  - IMMH  - DemographyMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - Personnel Management/*trendsMH  - Personnel Selection/*trendsMH  - *SportsMH  - *WomenEDAT- 1981/03/01MHDA- 1981/03/01 00:01CRDT- 1981/03/01 00:00AID - 10.1080/02701367.1981.10609290 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Res Q Exerc Sport. 1981 Mar;52(1):9-18.PMID- 7025282OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19811118DCOM- 19811118LR  - 20131121IS  - 0081-9638 (Print)IS  - 0081-9638 (Linking)VI  - 13DP  - 1981TI  - Advances in sports medicine. Prevention of head and neck injuries in football.PG  - 251-70AB  - Statistics on catastrophic head and neck injuries in football provide a more      realistic indication of the incidence of serious injuries occurring on the      football field than do the fatality figures. These statistics, however, provide      no clues for preventing such injuries. Moreover, research using head models,      anesthetized animals, cadaveric heads, and estimates of brain tolerance to impact      based on studies of actual injuries to the heads of humans has produced      conflicting data with respect to the goal of improving the safety record of the      sport. To reconcile the data and to provide some solutions to the problem of      serious injuries on the playing field, we reviewed the data collected in the      laboratory and correlated it with the information obtained from telemetry      studies. As a result of combining these two data sources, we concluded that      injuries on the playing field occur at either end of the spectrum of offered      resistance: when too much resistance is offered and when little or no resistance       is offered. We demonstrated that, by avoiding either of these extremes, serious      injuries to the head and neck can be reduced considerably. Finally, we discussed       the importance of preprogrammed responses by the experienced, well-conditioned      athlete. These allow the athlete to avoid either extreme of resistance and,      thereby, protect him from injury. Clearly, the data obtained from laboratory and       telemetry studies will prove instrumental in effecting changes in the sport of      football. As a result of these studies, we can hope for alterations in the design      of the helmet, enlightened coaching techniques, and rule revisions--all of which       will serve to make football a safe sport.FAU - Reid, S EAU  - Reid SEFAU - Reid, S E JrAU  - Reid SE JrLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPT  - ReviewPL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Surg AnnuJT  - Surgery annualJID - 0221302SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - AnimalsMH  - Athletic Injuries/mortality/*prevention & controlMH  - Biomechanical PhenomenaMH  - ChildMH  - Craniocerebral Trauma/*prevention & controlMH  - *FootballMH  - Head Protective Devices/standardsMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Neck/radiographyMH  - *Neck InjuriesMH  - Sports Medicine/methodsMH  - Telemetry/instrumentation/methodsRF  - 32EDAT- 1981/01/01MHDA- 2001/03/28 10:01CRDT- 1981/01/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Surg Annu. 1981;13:251-70.PMID- 6961134OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19830317DCOM- 19830317LR  - 20081121IS  - 0300-9645 (Print)IS  - 0300-9645 (Linking)VI  - 7DP  - 1981TI  - Sport and mental health.PG  - 83-95FAU - Yaffe, MAU  - Yaffe MLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - ENGLANDTA  - J Biosoc Sci SupplJT  - Journal of biosocial science.

However, these procedures have been limited to the use of positive      reinforcement for correct performance when applied to the acquisition of complex       sports skills in natural settings. To find complementary procedures to enhance      skill acquisition, a coaching method involving several behavioral techniques was       developed that focused on remediation of errors. This coaching method combined      the following components: (1) systematic use of verbal instructions and feedback,      (2) positive and negative reinforcement, (3) positive practice, and (4) time out.      Three sports, football, gymnastics, and tennis, were selected to determine the      effectiveness and generality of this behavioral coaching method. A total of 23      male and female subjects, ranging in age from 11 to 35, was included in this      study. Baseline data were first collected for each sport under standard coaching       conditions. Next, the behavioral coaching method was evaluated depending on the      sport in either a multiple baseline or a reversal design. The behavioral      dimensions selected were blocking in football; backward walkovers, front hand      springs, and reverse kips in gymnastics; and the forehand, backhand, and serve in      tennis. Behavioral coaching was immediately effective in increasing the correct      execution of complex skills in all three sports. Gains of up to 10 times the      baseline performance were achieved in each sport. In football, behavioral      coaching resulted in an increase in correct blocking performance from a baseline       average of 5% to 51.3%. Gymnasts' performances increased from baseline averages      of 2.7% to 52.6% across the three skills. In tennis, standard coaching produced      an average of 6% correct performance which increased dramatically under      behavioral coaching to 57% across the three strokes. The success of the      behavioral coaching package used here suggests that a technology of behavior may       offer additional and complementary strategies to the acquisition of motor skills       in the natural environment.FAU - Allison, M GAU  - Allison MGAD  - Georgia State University.FAU - Ayllon, TAU  - Ayllon TLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Appl Behav AnalJT  - Journal of applied behavior analysisJID - 0174763PMC - PMC1308133EDAT- 1980/07/01 00:00MHDA- 1980/07/01 00:01CRDT- 1980/07/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Appl Behav Anal. 1980 Summer;13(2):297-314.PMID- 7445535OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19810226DCOM- 19810226LR  - 20130922IS  - 0044-0086 (Print)IS  - 0044-0086 (Linking)VI  - 53IP  - 4DP  - 1980 Jul-AugTI  - Administrative issues in the management of a sports medicine program.PG  - 289-94AB  - Sports medicine is a subspecialty of medicine which has recently gained      prominence in this country. It is usually practiced in conjunction with a      specific program of sports medicine in an institutional setting, such as a      university. This article describes the integration of sports medicine and the      department of athletics at Yale University. The athletic medicine department, as       it is called, treats both the injuries and other medical problems of students      participating in the organized athletic programs, be they intercollegiate or      intramural, which are organized by the University. Problems that arise both      medically, such as when to play an injured player, and administratively, such as       who should supervise trainers, are discussed. Guidelines are given for choosing      the director of this program, as are examples of how to deal with problems      between the physicians and the coaches.FAU - Rowe, D SAU  - Rowe DSFAU - Fox, K PAU  - Fox KPLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Yale J Biol MedJT  - The Yale journal of biology and medicineJID - 0417414SB  - IMMH  - Athletic Injuries/therapyMH  - HumansMH  - *Sports MedicineMH  - Student Health Services/*organization & administrationMH  - Universities/organization & administrationPMC - PMC2595827OID - NLM: PMC2595827EDAT- 1980/07/01MHDA- 1980/07/01 00:01CRDT- 1980/07/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Yale J Biol Med. 1980 Jul-Aug;53(4):289-94.PMID- 7404523OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19801024DCOM- 19801024LR  - 20080716IS  - 0029-2001 (Print)IS  - 0029-2001 (Linking)VI  - 100IP  - 12BDP  - 1980 May 5TI  - [Sports for children and young people in relation to psychosocial health].PG  - 799-806FAU - Railo, W SAU  - Railo WSLA  - norPT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticleTT  - Barne- og ungdomsidretten sett i relasjon til psykososial helse.PL  - NORWAYTA  - Tidsskr Nor LaegeforenJT  - Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny      raekkeJID - 0413423SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - ChildMH  - Child, PreschoolMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - *Mental HealthMH  - Social EnvironmentMH  - Social ProblemsMH  - *SportsEDAT- 1980/05/05MHDA- 1980/05/05 00:01CRDT- 1980/05/05 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen. 1980 May 5;100(12B):799-806.PMID- 7390200OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19800928DCOM- 19800928LR  - 20041117IS  - 0016-9900 (Print)IS  - 0016-9900 (Linking)IP  - 5DP  - 1980 MayTI  - [Effect of various types of sports exercises on student mental work capacity].PG  - 84-6FAU - Emets, A IAU  - Emets AIFAU - Dement'ev, V VAU  - Dement'ev VVLA  - rusPT  - Journal ArticleTT  - Vliianie zaniatii razlichnymi vidami sporta na umstvennuiu rabotosposobnost'      studentov.PL  - USSRTA  - Gig SanitJT  - Gigiena i sanitariiaJID - 0412700SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Mental Processes/*physiologyMH  - Psychological TestsMH  - *SportsEDAT- 1980/05/01MHDA- 1980/05/01 00:01CRDT- 1980/05/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Gig Sanit. 1980 May;(5):84-6.PMID- 7373150OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19800722DCOM- 19800722LR  - 20041117IS  - 0025-0694 (Print)IS  - 0025-0694 (Linking)VI  - 71IP  - 4DP  - 1980 AprTI  - The psychiatric aspects of sports and fitness.PG  - 101-3, 105FAU - MacKinnon, B LAU  - MacKinnon BLLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - UNITED STATESTA  - J Maine Med AssocJT  - The Journal of the Maine Medical AssociationJID - 7505619SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - *Mental DisordersMH  - Middle AgedMH  - *Physical FitnessMH  - PsychologyMH  - *Sports MedicineEDAT- 1980/04/01MHDA- 1980/04/01 00:01CRDT- 1980/04/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Maine Med Assoc. 1980 Apr;71(4):101-3, 105.PMID- 7365447OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19800616DCOM- 19800616LR  - 20041117IS  - 0094-3509 (Print)IS  - 0094-3509 (Linking)VI  - 10IP  - 4DP  - 1980 AprTI  - Psychological trauma in children and youth in competitive sports.PG  - 737-9FAU - Smilkstein, GAU  - Smilkstein GLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - UNITED STATESTA  - J Fam PractJT  - The Journal of family practiceJID - 7502590SB  - AIMSB  - IMMH  - Anxiety/etiologyMH  - ChildMH  - Child DevelopmentMH  - *Competitive BehaviorMH  - HumansMH  - Mental Disorders/*etiologyMH  - *SportsMH  - Stress, Psychological/etiologyEDAT- 1980/04/01MHDA- 1980/04/01 00:01CRDT- 1980/04/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Fam Pract. 1980 Apr;10(4):737-9.PMID- 7394279OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19800928DCOM- 19800928LR  - 20041117IS  - 0270-1367 (Print)IS  - 0270-1367 (Linking)VI  - 51IP  - 1DP  - 1980 MarTI  - Sociology of physical educator/coaches: personal attributes controversy.PG  - 110-21FAU - Sage, G HAU  - Sage GHLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Res Q Exerc SportJT  - Research quarterly for exercise and sportJID - 8006373SB  - IMMH  - AttitudeMH  - HumansMH  - *PersonalityMH  - Physical Education and Training/*trendsMH  - SociologyMH  - SportsMH  - Teaching/*manpowerEDAT- 1980/03/01MHDA- 1980/03/01 00:01CRDT- 1980/03/01 00:00AID - 10.1080/02701367.1980.10609278 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Res Q Exerc Sport. 1980 Mar;51(1):110-21.PMID- 18810170OWN - NLMSTAT- PubMed-not-MEDLINEDA  - 20080923DCOM- 20121002IS  - 0190-6011 (Print)IS  - 0190-6011 (Linking)VI  - 1IP  - 4DP  - 1980TI  - Sports medicine centers in the United States: the personnel, patients, and      services.PG  - 222-5AB  - Sports medicine in the United States is a rapidly expanding field. The movement      of the public into organized and informal recreation and sports has stimulated      the growth and sophistication of sports medicine. In the last 35 years,      sports-related injuries have received unprecedented interest. Numerous sports      medicine centers (SMC) have been established to meet the increased demand for a      specialized approach to the treatment of sports injuries. Three main functions of      SMC's have been reported: 1) research into the causes of and possible prevention       of sports injuries; 2) sports medicine education for physicians, medical      students, allied medical professionals, coaches, and the public; and 3) care of      the injured athlete including the areas of prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and       rehabilitate.In the latter half of 1978, this investigator surveyed SMC's in the       United States to identify the status of selected aspects of the operations and      approaches to sports medical treatment at these centers and also to provide a      profile of sports medicine centers. A listing of SMC's was generated and a      specially constructed survey instrument was mailed to 85 centers. Of the centers       identified for this study, 71 (83.5%) responded with either a completed survey or      a letter of explanation. Of those 71 responding, 56 (79%) met criteria      established for inclusion in the study. These criteria were that the SMC: 1)      specialized in the care of athletic injuries, and 2) had a patient population      presenting primarily participant sports-related injuries.J Orthop Sports Phys      Ther 1980;1(4):222-225.FAU - Esterson, P SAU  - Esterson PSLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - J Orthop Sports Phys TherJT  - The Journal of orthopaedic and sports physical therapyJID - 7908150EDAT- 1980/01/01 00:00MHDA- 1980/01/01 00:01CRDT- 1980/01/01 00:00PHST- 1980/04/01 [ppublish]AID - 2225 [pii]AID - 10.2519/jospt.1980.1.4.222 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Orthop Sports Phys Ther. 1980;1(4):222-5.PMID- 545523OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19800712DCOM- 19800712LR  - 20131121IS  - 0034-5377 (Print)IS  - 0034-5377 (Linking)VI  - 50IP  - 3DP  - 1979 OctTI  - Attitudes of volunteer coaches toward significant youth sport issues.PG  - 369-80FAU - Gould, DAU  - Gould DFAU - Martens, RAU  - Martens RLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Res QJT  - Research quarterlyJID - 0401301SB  - IMMH  - *AttitudeMH  - DemographyMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - LeadershipMH  - MaleMH  - QuestionnairesMH  - *SportsMH  - Volunteers/psychologyEDAT- 1979/10/01MHDA- 1979/10/01 00:01CRDT- 1979/10/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Res Q. 1979 Oct;50(3):369-80.PMID- 291106OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19791229DCOM- 19791229LR  - 20041117IS  - 0363-7913 (Print)IS  - 0363-7913 (Linking)VI  - 62IP  - 9DP  - 1979 SepTI  - The team physician, trainer, instructor, coach, and the law.

The Deutsche Caritasverband      (association of German catholic welfare organisations) has now developed a      training programme for sports supervisors which follows the training regulations       of the Deutsche Sportbund (a German sports association). It is intended for all      interested in working with the disabled. The whole training course consists of      180 hours. It is devided into a basic and an advanced course, each lasting one      week of 75 study hours. Between these two courses the attendants are obliged to      study at home and to observe and work with groups of disabled for at least 30      hours. The studies mainly focus on the two subjects "sports for the physically      handicapped" and "sports for the mentally handicapped" and lead to the sports      supervisors certificates A or F of the Deutsche Behindertensportverband (a German      association for sports for the disabled).FAU - Uihlein, HAU  - Uihlein HFAU - Zalfen, WAU  - Zalfen WLA  - gerPT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticleTT  - Ubungsleiterausbildung im Behindertensport.PL  - GERMANY, WESTTA  - Rehabilitation (Stuttg)JT  - Die RehabilitationJID - 0401273SB  - IMMH  - *Disabled PersonsMH  - Germany, WestMH  - HumansMH  - Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine/*educationMH  - *SportsEDAT- 1978/02/01MHDA- 1978/02/01 00:01CRDT- 1978/02/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Rehabilitation (Stuttg). 1978 Feb;17(1):50-2.PMID- 692298OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19781202DCOM- 19781202LR  - 20061115IS  - 0025-7990 (Print)IS  - 0025-7990 (Linking)VI  - 10IP  - 2DP  - 1978 SummerTI  - Factors related to competitive stress among male youth sport participants.PG  - 103-8AB  - A study was conducted to determine intrapersonal and situational factors related       to the stress experienced by 11 and 12 year old boys participating in competitive      youth sports. Potential stress related factors were assessed at preseason,      pregame, and postgame periods. The indicant of stress was state anxiety measured       by the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory for Children administered 30 minutes      prior to and immediately following a competitive soccer game. Findings indicated       that competitive trait anxiety, self esteem, basal state anxiety, and      expectancies of self and team performance outcomes were significantly related to       stress experienced when anticipating competition. As hypothesized, game win-loss       was a highly significant predictor of post-game stress. Other predictors of      postgame stress were the game win-loss x game closeness interaction, the amount      of fun experienced during the game, basal state anxiety, and the perceived      importance of a game win to the coach. The findings are discussed in terms of the      child's actual and perceived response capabilities in meeting the performance      demands of the highly evaluative sport competition process.FAU - Scanlan, T KAU  - Scanlan TKFAU - Passer, M WAU  - Passer MWLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.PL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Med Sci SportsJT  - Medicine and science in sportsJID - 0203246SB  - IMMH  - Analysis of VarianceMH  - *AnxietyMH  - ChildMH  - *Competitive BehaviorMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Self ConceptMH  - SoccerMH  - *Social PerceptionMH  - *Sports MedicineMH  - *Stress, PsychologicalMH  - Task Performance and AnalysisEDAT- 1978/01/01MHDA- 1978/01/01 00:01CRDT- 1978/01/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Med Sci Sports. 1978 Summer;10(2):103-8.PMID- 271311OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19780218DCOM- 19780218LR  - 20041117IS  - 0034-5377 (Print)IS  - 0034-5377 (Linking)VI  - 48IP  - 4DP  - 1977 DecTI  - Compatibility in the coach-athlete dyad.PG  - 671-9FAU - Carron, A VAU  - Carron AVFAU - Bennett, B BAU  - Bennett BBLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Res QJT  - Research quarterlyJID - 0401301SB  - IMMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - *Interpersonal RelationsMH  - LoveMH  - MaleMH  - PersonalityMH  - Personality InventoryMH  - Social DominanceMH  - *SportsEDAT- 1977/12/01MHDA- 1977/12/01 00:01CRDT- 1977/12/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Res Q. 1977 Dec;48(4):671-9.PMID- 10306012OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19780426DCOM- 19780426LR  - 20091111IS  - 0008-2791 (Print)IS  - 0008-2791 (Linking)VI  - 25IP  - 4DP  - 1977 DecTI  - Psychiatric teams: the sport of mental health practice.PG  - 15-7FAU - Trute, BAU  - Trute BFAU - Macpherson, A SAU  - Macpherson ASLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - CANADATA  - Can Ment HealthJT  - Canada's mental healthJID - 0070157SB  - HMH  - HumansMH  - Mental Disorders/*therapyMH  - Mental Health Services/*organization & administrationMH  - *Patient Care TeamEDAT- 1977/11/08MHDA- 1977/11/08 00:01CRDT- 1977/11/08 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Can Ment Health. 1977 Dec;25(4):15-7.PMID- 267981OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19770917DCOM- 19770917LR  - 20061115IS  - 0034-5377 (Print)IS  - 0034-5377 (Linking)VI  - 48IP  - 2DP  - 1977 MayTI  - A system for the behavioral assessment of athletic coaches.PG  - 401-7FAU - Smith, R EAU  - Smith REFAU - Smoll, F LAU  - Smoll FLFAU - Hunt, EAU  - Hunt ELA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.PL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Res QJT  - Research quarterlyJID - 0401301SB  - IMMH  - *BehaviorMH  - HumansMH  - Interpersonal RelationsMH  - *Physical Education and TrainingMH  - *Psychological TestsMH  - SportsEDAT- 1977/05/01MHDA- 1977/05/01 00:01CRDT- 1977/05/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Res Q. 1977 May;48(2):401-7.PMID- 266245OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19770611DCOM- 19770611LR  - 20041117IS  - 0034-5377 (Print)IS  - 0034-5377 (Linking)VI  - 48IP  - 1DP  - 1977 MarTI  - Psychological scaling of AIAW code of ethics for coaches.PG  - 233-8FAU - Kroll, WAU  - Kroll WLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Res QJT  - Research quarterlyJID - 0401301SB  - IMMH  - AttitudeMH  - BehaviorMH  - *EthicsMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Sex FactorsMH  - *SportsMH  - Teaching/standardsEDAT- 1977/03/01MHDA- 1977/03/01 00:01CRDT- 1977/03/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Res Q. 1977 Mar;48(1):233-8.PMID- 140284OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19770611DCOM- 19770611LR  - 20091111IS  - 0024-3477 (Print)IS  - 0024-3477 (Linking)VI  - 98IP  - 12DP  - 1976 DecTI  - [Sports for the handicapped as a current method in the psychophysical      rehabilitation of the handicapped] (author's transl)PG  - 682-3FAU - Neralic, NAU  - Neralic NLA  - hrvPT  - English AbstractPT  - Journal ArticleTT  - Invalidski sport kao suvremena metoda u psihofizickoj rehabilitaciji invalidnih      osobaPL  - YUGOSLAVIATA  - Lijec VjesnJT  - Lijecnicki vjesnikJID - 0074253SB  - IMMH  - *Disabled PersonsMH  - HumansMH  - Mental Disorders/*rehabilitationMH  - RecreationMH  - *RehabilitationMH  - *SportsEDAT- 1976/12/01MHDA- 1976/12/01 00:01CRDT- 1976/12/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Lijec Vjesn. 1976 Dec;98(12):682-3.PMID- 1027020OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19770729DCOM- 19770729LR  - 20061115IS  - 0303-4259 (Print)IS  - 0303-4259 (Linking)VI  - 3IP  - 3DP  - 1976 AugTI  - [Thoughts on the slogan "Everything normal as possible". 2.

In      terms of psychological stress (as opposed to physiological) the single most      important variable appears to be the subject's interpretation of the      stress-producing stimuli. Increases in adrenaline and noradrenaline accompany a      variety of emotional responses, but differential proportions are not seen as      characterizing the various emotions. Noradrenaline secretion appears to be      related to physiological stress, or the amount of work attempted by the organism.      Adrenaline secretion seems to be more-directly related to mental stress and      emotional response. As emotional involvement increases, adrenal medullary      secretion of adrenaline increases. The accompanying physiological and metabolic      responses faciltate performance to a point; however, extremely high levels of      arousal may adversely affect the athlete's proficiency. This is expecially true      of sport skills requiring steadiness, precision, and concentration. Finally, for       the sake of perspective, it should be stated that any contribution or      complication created by the catecholamines is minimal when the entire ability      range of competitors is considered. Whereas near superhuman feats by ordinary      individuals caught in life-threatening situations have been reported, variations       of great magnitude are unlikely in sport. The average individual is not      transformed into a world class athlete merely by "getting the adrenaline      flowing."
