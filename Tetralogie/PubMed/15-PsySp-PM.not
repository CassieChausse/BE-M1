TI  - Motivational climate, goal orientation, perceived sport ability, and enjoyment
      within Finnish junior ice hockey players.
LID - 10.1111/sms.12410 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the relations among situational
      motivational climate, dispositional approach and avoidance achievement goals,
      perceived sport ability, and enjoyment in Finnish male junior ice hockey players.
      The sample comprised 265 junior B-level male players with a mean age of 17.03
      years (SD = 0.63). Players filled questionnaires tapping their perceptions of
      coach motivational climate, achievement goals, perceived sport ability, and
      enjoyment. For the statistical analysis, players were divided into high and low
      perceived sport ability groups. Multigroup structural equation modeling (SEM)
      revealed an indirect path from task-involving motivational climate via
      task-approach goal to enjoyment. Additionally, SEM demonstrated four other direct
      associations, which existed in both perceived ability groups: from ego-involving 
      motivational climate to ego-approach and ego-avoidance goals; from ego-approach
      goal to ego-avoidance goal; and from task-avoidance goal to ego-avoidance goal.
      Additionally, in the high perceived sport ability group, there was an association
      from task-involving motivational climate to enjoyment. The results of this study 
      reveal that motivational climate emphasizing effort, personal development and
      improvement, and achievement goal mastering tasks are significant elements of
      enjoyment in junior ice hockey.

TI  - Factors to consider when assessing diurnal variation in sports performance: the
      influence of chronotype and habitual training time-of-day.
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare morning and evening time-trial
      performance, RPE and mood state of trained swimmers, taking into account
      chronotype, habitual training time-of-day and PERIOD3 (PER3) variable number
      tandem repeat genotype. METHODS: Twenty-six swimmers (18 males, age: 32.6 +/- 5.7
      years) swam 200 m time trials (TT) at 06h30 and 18h30 in a randomised order.
      RESULTS: There was no difference between morning and evening performance when the
      swimmers were considered as a single group (06h30: 158.8 +/- 22.7 s, 18h30: 158.5
      +/- 22.0 s, p = 0.611). However, grouping swimmers by chronotype and habitual
      training time-of-day allowed us to detect significant diurnal variation in
      performance, such that morning-type swimmers and those who habitually train in
      the morning were faster in the 06h30 TT (p = 0.036 and p = 0.011, respectively). 
      This was accompanied by lower ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) scores
      post-warm-up, higher vigour and lower fatigues scores prior to the 06h30 TT in
      morning-type swimmers or those who trained in the morning. Similarly, neither
      types and those who trained in the evenings had lower fatigue and higher vigour
      prior to the 18h30 TT. CONCLUSIONS: It appears that both chronotype and habitual 
      training time-of-day need to be considered when assessing diurnal variation in
      performance. From a practical point of view, athletes and coaches should be aware
      of the potentially powerful effect of training time on shifting time-of-day
      variation in performance.

PG  - 577-89
LID - 10.3305/nh.2015.31.2.7852 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The report issued by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) in 2010
      on nutrition and health claims, shows that there is no scientific evidence to
      support supplementation with branched chain amino acids (BCAAs). The aim of this 
      study is to analyze the effects of consumption of BCAAs in endurance sports.
      METHODS: A literature review on the current state of the effect of consumption of
      dietary supplements of BCAAs. We conducted a search in the PubMed database and
      snowball strategy. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Spanish / English randomized clinical
      trial related to the consumption of BCAAs, leucine, valine and isoleucine in
      endurance sports and its effects on muscle damage, athletic performance, central 
      fatigue, anabolic signals during recovery and immune system response published in
      any country until May 2014. RESULTS: Out of 330 studies identified, 14 met the
      inclusion criteria. The mean of subjects participating in the study was
      (11.36+/-7.43). Only two studies included a group of women. The sports that we
      found in the studies were: run, cycling, combining cycling and running, Olympic
      distance triathlon and one study included 2 groups of athletes (Olympic distance 
      triathletes and runners). The effects of BCAAs and muscle damage, athletic
      performance, central fatigue, anabolic signals during recovery period and immune 
      response were studied at different times: before, during and after training or a 
      combination of these. DISCUSSION: It is observed that there is a lesser degree of
      pain and muscle damage, less perceived exertion and mental fatigue, greater
      anabolic response in recovery period and improved immune response when
      supplemented with BCAAs, notwithstanding its decision before or during physical
      activity does not improve athletic performance. No consensus was found in the
      dose and timing of the most effective decision, although it is more effective if 
      there is 2-3/1/1g relationship between leucine / isoleucine and valine amino
      acids.

TI  - Effects of gender, imagery ability, and sports practice on the performance of a
      mental rotation task.
PG  - 313-23
AB  - Mental rotation is one of the main spatial abilities necessary in the spatial
      transformation of mental images and the manipulation of spatial parameters.
      Researchers have shown that mental rotation abilities differ between populations 
      depending on several variables. This study uses a mental rotation task to
      investigate effects of several factors on the spatial abilities of 277
      volunteers. The results demonstrate that high and low imagers performed equally
      well on this tasks. Athletes outperformed nonathletes regardless of their
      discipline, and athletes with greater expertise outperformed those with less
      experience. The results replicate the previously reported finding that men
      exhibit better spatial abilities than women. However, with high amounts of
      practice, the women in the current study were able to perform as well as men.

TI  - How should "hot" players in basketball be defended? The use of fast-and-frugal
      heuristics by basketball coaches and players in response to streakiness.
PG  - 1-9
AB  - Abstract Previous research has shown that changes in shot difficulty may have
      rendered the hot-hand effect in basketball unobservable and are potentially a
      result of defensive adjustments. However, it has not been directly analysed
      whether strategic changes indeed take place in response to streakiness and
      whether they are effective with respect to winning games. The current work
      consists of an experimental study with 18 professional coaches and 20 players
      based on video sequences from National Basketball Association games, where the
      shown player displayed a streaky performance in half of the sequences. While
      coaches were asked to devise a defensive strategy after each viewed sequence,
      players had to assume the role of the shown player and decide whether to shoot or
      pass the ball. We find that coaches tended to increase the defensive pressure
      significantly more often on presumably hot players and thus make use of the
      hot-hand heuristic. Meanwhile, players chose to shoot more frequently in
      low-pressure and streaky situations but selected "pass" regardless of the
      previous performance when they faced increased defensive pressure. Assuming that 
      a streaky player's performance is indeed elevated during hot phases, hot-hand
      behaviour can be considered adaptive in certain situations as it led hot players 
      to pass instead of shoot.

TI  - Athletes' Use of Mental Skills During Sport Injury Rehabilitation.
AB  - CONTEXT: Existing theoretical frameworks and empirical research support the
      applicability and usefulness of integrating mental skills throughout sport injury
      rehabilitation. Objective: To determine what, if any, mental skills athletes use 
      during injury rehabilitation, and by whom these skills were taught.
      Cross-cultural differences were also examined. DESIGN: Cross-sectional design.
      SETTING: United States (US) collegiate athletes from five universities and a
      mixture of collegiate, professional, and recreational club athletes from the
      United Kingdom (UK) and Finland were recruited for this study. PARTICIPANTS: A
      total of 1283 athletes from the US, UK, and Finland, who participated in diverse 
      sports at varying competitive levels took part in this study. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURES: As part of a larger study on athletes' expectations of injury
      rehabilitation, participants were asked a series of open-ended and closed-ended
      questions concerning their use of mental skills during injury rehabilitation.
      RESULTS: Over half (64.0%) of the sample reported previous experience with
      athletic training, while 27.0% indicated that they used mental skills during
      injury rehabilitation. The top three mental skills reported were goal setting,
      positive self-talk/positive thoughts and imagery. Of those athletes that used
      mental skills, 71.6% indicated that they felt mental skills helped them to
      rehabilitate faster. A greater proportion of athletes from the US (33.4%)
      reported that they used mental skills during rehabilitation compared to athletes 
      from the UK (23.4%) and Finland (20.3%). A small portion (27.6%) of the
      participants indicated that their sports medicine professional had taught them
      how to use mental skills; only 3% were taught mental skills by a sport
      psychologist. CONCLUSIONS: The low number of athletes who reported using mental
      skills during rehabilitation is discouraging, but not surprising given research
      findings that mental skills are underutilized by injured athletes in the three
      countries examined. More effort should be focused on educating and training
      athletes, coaches, and sports medicine professionals on the effectiveness of
      mental training within the injury rehabilitation context.

TI  - Nutritional supplement and doping use in sport: Possible underlying social
      cognitive processes.
LID - 10.1111/sms.12377 [doi]
AB  - There is growing evidence suggesting that nutritional supplement (NS) use is
      strongly associated to doping use in elite and amateur sports. However, there is 
      a paucity of research on the psychological processes that underlie this
      association. The present study investigated the cognitive and behavioral
      components of the association between NS use and doping among adolescent
      sub-elite athletes. Six hundred and fifty adolescent athletes completed a
      questionnaire including measures of doping intentions, attitudes, norms, and
      beliefs about NS use. The results showed that NS users who did not report doping 
      use had significantly stronger doping intentions and more positive attitudes and 
      favorable beliefs toward doping use, as compared with athletes who did not use
      NS. In support of the "shared mental representations" hypothesis, the present
      findings show that NS use is associated with biased reasoning patterns in favor
      of doping use. This mechanism may explain why some NS users decide to engage in
      doping.

TI  - Virtual coaching for the high-intensity training of a powerlifter following
      coronary artery bypass grafting.
PG  - 75-7
AB  - A 55-year-old powerlifter in Tennessee learned about the sport-specific,
      high-intensity cardiac rehabilitation training available in Dallas, Texas, and
      contacted the staff by phone. He was recovering from quadruple coronary artery
      bypass grafting (CABG) and had completed several weeks of traditional cardiac
      rehabilitation in his hometown, but the exercise program no longer met his needs.
      He wanted help in returning both to his normal training regimen and to
      powerlifting competition but was unable to attend the Dallas program in person.
      An exercise physiologist with the program devised a virtual coaching model in
      which the patient was sent a wrist blood pressure cuff for self-monitoring and
      was advised about exercises that would not harm his healing sternum, even as the 
      weight loads were gradually increased. After 17 weeks of symptom-limited,
      high-intensity training that was complemented by phone and e-mail support, the
      patient was lifting heavier loads than he had before CABG. At a powerlifting
      competition 10 months after CABG, he placed first in his age group. This case
      report exemplifies the need for alternative approaches to the delivery of cardiac
      rehabilitation services.

TI  - A survey of Canadian Alpine ski racing coaches regarding spinal protective
      devices for their athletes.
PG  - 428-35
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Spinal protective devices are a recent addition to the protective
      equipment worn by competitive and recreational alpine skiers and snowboarders.
      Their rate of use is not documented at the time of publication. The objective of 
      this study was to examine the current attitudes and recommendations of Canadian
      alpine ski racing coaches towards spinal protective devices. METHODS: A
      convenience sample of alpine ski racing coaches across Canada were contacted in
      each provincial sport governing body in the ski racing community. A ten question 
      online survey was attached to the initial email. Descriptive statistical analysis
      was utilized. RESULTS: A total of 29 Canadian alpine ski racing coaches completed
      the study survey. All participants were familiar with spinal protective devices
      and 51.7% of respondents reported that they do not actively enforce spinal
      protective device use with their ski racing athletes. 80% of respondents reported
      that their Canadian ski racing club did not have guidelines or policies regarding
      spinal protective device use. 86.2% of respondents were unaware if their
      provincial sport organization had a policy regarding their use. DISCUSSION: The
      majority of coaches reporting training athletes aged 10-15, which may help to
      explain why only half of those surveyed enforce the use of spinal protective
      devices. This group of athletes may not participate in speed events as frequently
      as older athletes, where the use of spinal protective devices is more common.
      CONCLUSION: The majority of Canadian Alpine ski coaches report a belief that
      spinal protective device use is important, however, far fewer enforce their use, 
      or work in an environment with a policy requiring it. Further research is
      required to determine the differences in beliefs and practice.

TI  - A case of early sports specialization in an adolescent athlete.
PG  - 377-83
AB  - Early sport specialization (ESS) refers to intense year round training in a
      specific sport with the exclusion of other sports at a young age. This approach
      to training is heavily debated and there are claims both in support and against
      ESS. ESS is considered to be more common in the modern day youth athlete and
      could be a source of overuse injuries and burnout. This case describes a 16 year 
      old elite level baseball pitcher who engaged in high volume, intense training at 
      a young age which lead to several significant throwing related injuries. The case
      highlights the historical context of ESS, the potential risk and benefits as well
      as the evidence for its effectiveness. It is important for health care
      professionals to be informed on the topic of ESS in order to educate athletes,
      parents, coaches and organizations of the potential risks and benefits.

TI  - Health-related quality of life after solid organ transplantation: the role of
      sport activity.
PG  - 1-8
AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of sport activity on
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of solid organ transplant recipients
      participating in sports competitions. A group of 168 sportive transplanted
      patients (STP), a group of 97 nonsportive transplanted patients (NSTP), and a
      group of 152 sportive healthy controls (SHC) were compared on the eight scales of
      the SF-36 questionnaire. STP and NSTP reported significantly lower scores than
      SHC on the physical functioning scale. STP did not differ from SHC in the
      Role-Physical, General Health, and Vitality scales, while NSTP reported
      significantly lower scores. STP obtained higher scores than NSTP and SHC on
      Mental Health. Among STP, the effect of quantity of sport activity was
      significant on General Health and Role Emotional, with more sport activity
      associated with higher HRQoL. Organ failure and post-transplant therapies may
      have negative consequences on HRQoL. Sports activities and participation in
      sports competitions can reduce this impact, improving general and psychological
      functioning of solid organ transplant recipients.

TI  - A study of sports related occurrence of traumatic orodental injuries and
      associated risk factors in high school students in north India.
PG  - e22766
LID - 10.5812/asjsm.22766 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oral and dental injuries contribute to a major part of sports related
      injuries in children. Trauma occurring in developing years disrupts normal social
      functioning and brings about a major impact on quality of life due to their
      cumulative effect. OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence and causes of various
      sports related traumatic orodental injuries among 8 to 16 year school students
      along with identifying the associated risk factors in North India. PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: A cross sectional study consisting of high school students of different 
      organized sports teams aged 8-16 years was carried out in geographical area of
      north India. The students were selected by multistage cluster sampling
      methodology. 1105 students from 19 school teams (sports teams) and sports
      academies participated in study through structured interview and clinical
      examination in different sports situations. RESULTS: 30.3% (n = 335) of students 
      suffered from orodental injuries. A higher number of girls had injury (32%) than 
      boys (29%), though the difference was not significant. Most of the students
      suffered from soft tissue injuries (48%) followed by tooth fractures (43%).
      Maximum numbers of injuries were reported in high velocity (44.1%) and medium
      intensity sports (46.6%) (P < 0.001) Maximum injuries occurred in basketball
      (50%) and lowest in the field of badminton (6.1%) (P < 0.05). Amateurs (52%)
      suffered the most from injuries as per level of coaching. Only 6% of boys and 2% 
      of girls used mouthguards. CONCLUSIONS: The result of the present study confirmed
      that students participating in different organized sports at high school level
      are at a very high risk of getting orodental injury. Hence knowledge and
      education regarding prevention of traumatic injuries is of paramount importance.

TI  - Opioid Use Among Interscholastic Sports Participants: An Exploratory Study From a
      Sample of College Students.
PG  - 1-7
AB  - Purpose: Involvement in sports increases the risk for injury and the risk for
      prescription opioid use and misuse. This was an exploratory retrospective study
      to examine if previous involvement in interscholastic sports was associated with 
      a greater lifetime prevalence of medical prescription opioid use, lifetime risk
      for diverting prescribed opioids, and lifetime risk for nonmedical prescription
      opioid use. Method: A Web-based survey was self-administered to a sample of 4,187
      full-time undergraduate students at a large public university located in the
      Midwest. Student demographics, involvement in interscholastic sports during high 
      school, lifetime medical prescription opioid use, lifetime risk for diverting
      prescribed opioids, and lifetime risk for nonmedical prescription opioid use were
      measured and analyzed for this study. Results: Multiple logistic regression
      analyses indicated that those who participated in at least 1 interscholastic
      sport during high school had greater odds for lifetime medical prescription
      opioid use on multiple occasions and greater odds for being approached to divert 
      their prescribed opioid medications on multiple occasions when compared with
      their peers who did not participate in interscholastic sports during high school.
      Conclusions: The findings indicate some association between previous involvement 
      in interscholastic sports and prescription opioid use and misuse. These findings 
      further suggest that greater awareness should be instilled in parents and coaches
      regarding this form of substance misuse.

AB  - ABSTRACT Female athletes experience pressure to conform to social and sporting
      norms concerning body weight. This study compared general and sporting body
      dissatisfaction and disordered eating symptomatology among 320 elite,
      recreational, and noncompetitive female athletes aged 17 to 30 years competing in
      leanness focused sports and nonleanness focused sports. Participants completed an
      online questionnaire including demographic questions, the Eating Attitudes Test, 
      and the Figure Rating Scale. Athletes from leanness focused sports reported
      higher levels of body dissatisfaction and greater disordered eating
      symptomatology regardless of participation level. Elite athletes reported higher 
      levels of body dissatisfaction and greater disordered eating symptomatology
      regardless of sport type, and differences between recreational and noncompetitive
      athletes were not found. More than 60% of elite athletes from leanness focused
      and nonleanness focused sports reported pressure from coaches concerning body
      shape. The findings have important implications for identifying risk factors for 
      eating disorders among female athletes, where athletes who compete at elite level
      and those who compete in leanness focused sports at any level may be at higher
      risk for developing eating disorders.

TI  - Half-Time Strategies to Enhance Second-Half Performance in Team-Sports Players: A
      Review and Recommendations.
AB  - A number of intermittent team sports require that two consecutive periods of play
      (lasting for ~30-45 min) are separated by a 10-20 min half-time break. The
      half-time practices employed by team-sports players generally include returning
      to the changing rooms, temporarily relaxing from the cognitive and physical
      demands of the first half, rehydration and re-fuelling strategies, addressing
      injury or equipment concerns, and receiving tactical instruction and coach
      feedback. However, the typically passive nature of these actions has been
      associated with physiological changes that impair performance during the second
      half. Both physical and cognitive performances have been found to decline in the 
      initial stages of subsequent exercise that follows half-time. An increased risk
      of injury has also been observed during this period. Therefore, half-time
      provides sports scientists and strength and conditioning coaches with an
      opportunity to optimise second-half performance. An overview of strategies
      thought to benefit team-sports athletes is presented; specifically, the efficacy 
      of heat maintenance strategies (including passive and active methods),
      post-activation potentiation, hormonal priming, and modified hydro-nutritional
      practices are discussed. A theoretical model of applying these strategies in a
      manner that compliments current practice is also offered.

TI  - Collegiate coaches' knowledge of the female athlete triad in relation to sport
      type.
AB  - AIM: The purpose of this study was to determine what coaches of female athletes
      know about the three components of the female athlete triad with regard to type
      of sport coached and the characteristics of the coach. METHODS: The sample
      consisted of 309 NCAA Division I coaches of female athletes in the sports of:
      sports with subjective scoring of performance (gymnastics and diving), low body
      weight sports (cross country and rowing), revealing or fitted clothing
      (volleyball and swimming), and other (soccer and basketball). An original,
      self--report questionnaire, and a 4--point Likert scale to measure confidence in 
      answer was used. The variables were: knowledge, confidence, and coach's
      characteristics (coach's gender, degree held, years of experience in coaching
      females, continuing education participation specific to the triad and triad
      components, and type of sport coached). RESULTS: Coaches of low body weight
      sports scored significantly higher than both coaches of sports requiring fitted
      clothing and "other" sports in the overall score. They further had significantly 
      more confidence in their answers than coaches of "other" sports. No significant
      differences in the overall score in any of the types of sport or total values
      were found regarding gender, experience, and degree. Coaches who had received
      training about the triad or its components scored significantly higher than
      coaches who did not receive training. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated a lack
      of information among coaches and that participating in formative training can
      help to reduce this problem. The results found can help in the design of
      continuing education for coaches.

AB  - Mild head trauma can be associated with concussion, defined as transient brain
      function impairment without radiological findings. Sports-related concussion is
      also reported in pediatrics (rugby, ice hockey, football, boxing, etc.).
      Misdiagnosis can lead to persistent neurocognitive signs with athletic and
      academic problems. Consensual tools are available, but they are not well-known by
      first-line doctors, coaches, and patients or parents. Concussed players should
      not be allowed to return to the field on the same day. Return to play should be
      gradual over 3weeks or more. School activities may need to be modified to favor
      cognitive rest. Prevention is based on risk information and knowledge transfer,
      rule changes, and protective helmets, whose effectiveness is not always proven.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Among the injury types, sports ones constitute a considerable
      proportion of patients who refer to the medical centers. This research was
      conducted to examine the frequency of sports-related injuries referring to Kashan
      University of Medical Sciences Trauma Research Center from 2005 to 2011. METHODS:
      This was a retrospective research in which existing data from the data bank of
      Kashan University of Medical Sciences Trauma Research Center were employed. The
      data were extracted from the main source by SPSS version 16.0. Variables such as 
      age, education, occupation and gender were analyzed. RESULTS: The highest
      proportion of injuries was observed in students (59.4%) followed by workers
      (11.8%). Upper and lower extremities were most commonly injured. The most
      frequent injury was strain (35.4%), followed by sprain (27.7%). CONCLUSION: The
      results of this research showed that the majority of the sports trauma occurrs in
      students; therefore, they need more attention in regard to sports injuries.
      Preventive measures such as informing the coaches and teachers as well as
      increasing the students'awareness about the injury risk can decrease the
      incidences of sports injuries.

TI  - Maintaining relevance: an evaluation of health message sponsorship at Australian 
      community sport and arts events.
PG  - 1242
LID - 10.1186/1471-2458-14-1242 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health message sponsorship at community sport and arts events is an
      established component of a health promotion settings approach. Recent increases
      in commercial sponsorship of sport and community events has swelled competition
      for consumer attention and potentially reduced the impact of health message
      sponsorship. The purpose of this study was to evaluate awareness, understandings 
      and behavioural intentions of health messages promoted at sponsored community
      sport and arts events. METHODS: Interview and self-administered surveys were
      completed by 2259 adults attending one of 29 sport and arts events held in
      Western Australia between 2008 and 2013. The surveys measured participant
      awareness of the health message promoted at the event, as well as comprehension, 
      acceptance and behavioural intention as a result of exposure to health messages. 
      RESULTS: Awareness of the sponsored health message was 58% across all sponsored
      events, with high levels of comprehension (74%) and acceptance (92%) among those 
      aware of the health message. Forming behavioural intentions was significantly
      related to the type of sponsored message promoted at the event, being female and 
      over 40 years of age. Messages about sun protection and promoting mental health
      were the most likely to result in behavioural intention. CONCLUSIONS: Health
      message sponsorship, at least within a comprehensive sponsorship program, appears
      to remain an effective health promotion strategy for generating awareness and
      behavioural intention among people attending sport and arts events. Remaining
      relevant within a modern sponsorship environment appears closely aligned to
      selecting health messages that promote behavioural action relevant to the
      sponsored event that are also supported by broader health promotion campaigns.

AB  - Sports participation is beneficial to health and socioemotional adjustment in
      youth across development. While there is some evidence indicating lower sports
      participation for children with developmental delays (DD) as compared with their 
      typically developing (TD) peers, little is known as to the predictors of this
      differential participation. Given the increased risk of physical and mental
      health difficulties for children with DD, understanding more about this disparity
      is important. We examined sports participation in elementary school-aged children
      with or without DD and examined child and family predictors of three indices of
      sports participation: number of sports and highest relational sport at ages 6 and
      8, and consistent sports from 6 to 8. Children with TD were significantly higher 
      on all three indicators. Mother and child factors related significantly to sports
      participation indices. The number of sports related positively to mother
      education and positive perceptions and negatively to mother employment.
      Relational sports were higher in boys, children with higher social skills, and
      lower behavior problems. In regression analyses at child age 8 that included
      these other variables, delay status (DD or TD) did not have a significant effect.
      Perspectives on varying influences on sports participation and implications for
      intervention are discussed.

LID - 10.1016/j.dhjo.2014.09.009 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite numerous physical, social, and mental health benefits of
      engaging in moderate and vigorous intensity physical activities (e.g., sport),
      few individuals with acquired physical disabilities currently participate in
      adapted sport. Theory-based sport promotion interventions are one possible way to
      increase the amount of individuals who engage in sport. OBJECTIVES: The primary
      objective of this study was to examine the profiles of three different sport
      participation groups with respect to demographic, injury, and Health Action
      Process Approach (HAPA) constructs. METHODS: ANOVAs and Chi-square tests were
      used to determine group differences on demographic and disability-related
      constructs. A MANCOVA was conducted to determine differences between three sport 
      participation groups (non-intenders, intenders, and actors) with age, years
      post-injury, mode of mobility, and sex included as covariates. RESULTS: A cohort 
      of 201 individuals was recruited; 56 (27.9%) were non-intenders, 21 (10.4%) were 
      intenders, and 124 (61.7%) were actors. The MANCOVA revealed significant
      differences between groups on the HAPA constructs, F(22,370) = 9.02, p < .0001,
      Pillai's trace = .70, demonstrating that individuals with acquired physical
      disabilities will rate important health behavior constructs differently based on 
      their sport intentions. CONCLUSION: These results provide an important framework 
      that adapted sport organizations can use to tailor their sport promotion
      programs.

LID - 10.1111/sms.12359 [doi]
AB  - The present study validated a Swedish version of the 47-item Coaching Behavior
      Scale for Sport (CBS-S). Sample 1 consisted of 506 team sport athletes [262 men
      and 244 women; mean age: 22.20, standard deviation (SD) = 3.90] distributed
      across 41 coaches at the two highest national levels of various sports. Athletes 
      completed the CBS-S and established questionnaires of coaching behaviors (LSS),
      self-confidence (CSAI-2R), and coach-athlete relationship (CART-Q). An additional
      sample of 39 basketball players (21 men and 18 women; mean age = 17.40, SD =
      2.39) completed the CBS-S twice, approximately 4 weeks apart. Confirmatory factor
      analysis showed an acceptable model fit for the seven-factor version of the
      CBS-S, although two items of the negative personal rapport subscale displayed
      insufficient factor loadings. Correlations between the subscales of the CBS-S and
      established instruments were in accordance with theoretical expectations,
      supporting the concurrent validity. Cronbach's alpha (> 0.82) for all dimensions 
      provided support for the reliability of the CBS-S, and test-retest correlations
      indicated moderate stability over time. Cultural differences in the assessment of
      coaching behaviors and the usability of the CBS-S by coaches for self-reflection 
      and development are discussed.

TI  - Review of the status of learning in research on sport education: future research 
      and practice.
PG  - 846-58
AB  - Research concerning Sport Education's educational impact has shown unequivocal
      results according to students' personal and social development. Nevertheless,
      research is still sparse with respect to the model's impact on student learning
      outcomes. The goal of the present review is to therefore scrutinize what is
      currently known regarding students' learning during their participation in Sport 
      Education. This research spans a variety of studies, cross various countries,
      school grades, the sports studied, as well as the methods applied and dimensions 
      of student learning analyzed. While research on the impact of Sport Education on 
      students' learning, as well as teachers' and students' perceptions about student 
      learning has shown students' improvements during the participation in Sport
      Education seasons, there is still considerable variance in these results. For
      example, some studies report superior learning opportunities to boys and higher
      skill-level students while other studies have identified superior learning
      opportunities for girls and lower skill-level students. These inconsistent
      results can be explained by factors not considered in the Sport Education
      research, such as the effect of time on students' learning and the control of the
      teaching-learning process within Sport Education units. In this review directions
      for future research and practice are also described. Future research should
      define, implement, and evaluate protocols for student-coaches' preparation in
      order to understand the influence of this issue on students' learning as well as 
      consider the implementation of hybrid approaches. Moreover, future studies should
      consider the interaction of gender and skill level and a retention test in the
      analysis of students' learning improvements in order to obtain a more realist and
      complete portrait of the impact of Sport Education. Finally, in order to reach an
      entirely understanding of the teaching-learning process, it is necessary to use
      research designs that attend to the complexity of this process. Key PointsDespite
      research regarding has showed students' improvements during the participation in 
      Sport Education seasons, it remains somewhat equivocal.The studies included in
      this review show students' improvements on skill, knowledge and tactical
      development, as we as game play, during the participation in Sport Education
      units.Some studies report superior learning opportunities to boys and higher
      skill-level students while other studies exposed superior learning opportunities 
      to girls and lower skill-level students.The effect of time on students' learning 
      and the control of the teaching-learning process within Sport Education units can
      explain these equivocal results.Future research is encouraged to consider the
      implementation of protocols for student-coaches' preparation, hybrid models, a
      retention test, the interaction of gender and skill level, and use research
      designs that attend to the complexity of the teaching-learning process.

TI  - Football and dementia: A qualitative investigation of a community based sports
      group for men with early onset dementia.
LID - 1471301214560239 [pii]
AB  - This study investigates the impact of a weekly group providing sport and physical
      activities for men with early onset dementia established by Notts County Football
      in the Community (NCFC). There were three aims: to investigate the effect of
      early onset dementia on individuals with the condition and their carers; to
      examine the perceptions of current levels of service provision for people with
      early onset dementia; and to analyse the impact of the group. Men with dementia
      (n = 5) attending the sessions, their carers (n = 5), NCFC coaching staff (n = 5)
      and people organizing/facilitating the sessions (n = 5) were interviewed.
      Semi-structured interviews explored the participants' experiences of dementia,
      their opinions on current service provisions and on the sessions. Data were
      analysed using thematic analysis. Four main themes were found: loss related to
      the condition of dementia and its impact on relationships ('Loss'); lack of
      age-appropriate services for people with early onset dementia ('Lack of
      Resources'); enjoyment and positive anticipation related to the group for all
      involved ('Enjoyment and Anticipation'); and 'the Notts County Effect' which
      attributed the success of the sessions to the strong brand of the football club, 
      and to personalized service in a "dementia-free" environment. The NCFC sessions
      provided a safe low-cost intervention with positive effects upon quality of life 
      for both people with early onset dementia, their carers and the staff involved.
      This suggests that the service may be valuable to a wider range of people living 
      in different areas.

TI  - Movement coaching: study protocol of a randomized controlled trial evaluating
      effects on physical activity and participation in low back pain patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic Low Back Pain is a complex syndrome with multifactorial
      bio-psycho-social etiology and interdependences. Thereby, physical activity seems
      to play an essential role regarding the prevention and rehabilitation of LBP. In 
      consequence, physical activity and exercise therapy is an integral part of
      musculoskeletal rehabilitation in LBP. However, adherence to self-directed
      exercise and implementing a health-enhancing physical activity in daily routine
      after rehabilitation is a common problem for patients and only a few patients
      integrate health-enhancing physical activity and/or sport activities in their
      lifestyle. The present paper describes a comprehensive multilevel approach
      combining face-to-face intervention, telephone and internet aftercare (Movement
      Coaching). Aim of the trial presented in this study protocol is to evaluate
      effectiveness of Movement Coaching compared to a control intervention.
      METHODS/DESIGN: The study is a prospective, single-blinded, monocenter randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) with three measuring points: T1=start of inpatient
      rehabilitation; T2=six months follow-up; T3=twelve months follow-up. In total,
      412 patients were recruited. The intervention involves small-group face-to-face
      contact during inpatient rehabilitation (two times, week 2 & 3) and telephone
      aftercare (week 8 & week 12 after rehabilitation) as well as internet-based
      aftercare (web 2.0 platform; available until six months after rehabilitation).
      Primary outcome is physical activity, assessed by GPAQ questionnaire. The final
      data collection is expected by April 2015. DISCUSSION: Due to the burden of
      physical inactivity, there is a need to develop, evaluate and disseminate
      approaches that are effective in promoting physical activity and especially
      promoting the maintenance of physical activity in relevant target groups.
      Considering the high prevalence and socioeconomic impact of low back pain and its
      multifactorial etiology, low back pain patients seem to be a relevant target
      group for physical activity promotion. A multilevel approach to bridge the
      interface of (inpatient) rehabilitation and self-directed physical activity will 
      help to target group-specific PA promotion. TRIAL REGISTRATION: German Clinical
      Trials Register (DRKS)-ID: DRKS00004878.

AB  - Does sport really produce positive effects in mental illness? The author
      discusses this question, through a survey of the literature. There is evidence
      that exercise increases endorphine levels. In order to support the prevention and
      treatment of depression through sport, it seems particularly useful, to encourage
      the practice of moderate, diversified physical activity.

      sports coaching practice.

AB  - Abstract This study examined the integration of professional judgement and
      decision-making processes in adventure sports coaching. The study utilised a
      thematic analysis approach to investigate the decision-making practices of a
      sample of high-level adventure sports coaches over a series of sessions. Results 
      revealed that, in order to make judgements and decisions in practice, expert
      coaches employ a range of practical and pedagogic management strategies to create
      and opportunistically use time for decision-making. These approaches include span
      of control and time management strategies to facilitate the decision-making
      process regarding risk management, venue selection, aims, objectives, session
      content, and differentiation of the coaching process. The implication for
      coaches, coach education, and accreditation is the recognition and training of
      the approaches that "create time" for the judgements in practice, namely
      "creating space to think". The paper concludes by offering a template for a more 
      expertise-focused progression in adventure sports coaching.

TI  - Generic and sport-specific reactive agility tests assess different qualities in
      court-based team sport athletes.
AB  - AIM: Comparisons between reactive agility tests incorporating generic and
      sport--specific stimuli have been performed only in field--based team sports. The
      aim of this study was to compare generic (light--based) and sport--specific (live
      opponent) reactive agility tests in court--based team sport athletes. METHODS:
      Twelve semi--professional male basketball players (age: 25.9 +/- 6.7 yr; stature:
      188.9 +/- 7.9 cm; body mass: 97.4 +/- 16.1 kg; predicted maximal oxygen uptake:
      49.5 +/- 5.3 mLkg--1min--1) completed multiple trials of a Reactive Agility Test 
      containing light--based (RAT--Light) and opponent--based stimuli (RAT--Opponent).
      Multiple outcome measures were collected during the RAT--Light (agility time and 
      total time) and RAT--Opponent (decision time and total time). RESULTS: Mean
      performance times during the RAT--Light (2.233 +/- 0.224 s) were significantly (P
      < 0.001) slower than during the RAT--Opponent (1.726 +/- 0.178 s). Further, a
      small relationship was observed between RAT--Light agility time and RAT--Opponent
      decision time (r10 = 0.20), while a trivial relationship was apparent between
      total performance times across tests (r10 = 0.02). Low commonality was observed
      between comparable measures across tests (R2 = 0--4%). CONCLUSION: Reactive
      agility tests containing light--based and live opponent stimuli appear to measure
      different qualities in court--based team sport athletes. Court--based team sport 
      coaches and conditioning professionals should not use generic and sport--specific
      reactive agility tests interchangeably during athlete assessments.

TI  - Evaluation of Sports Nutrition Knowledge and Recommendations Among High School
      Coaches.
AB  - The objectives of this study were to evaluate high school coaches' knowledge in
      sports nutrition and the nutritional practices they recommend to their athletes. 
      Forty-seven high school coaches in "leanness" and "non-leanness" sports from the 
      greater region of Quebec (women = 44.7 %) completed a questionnaire on
      nutritional knowledge and practices. "Leanness sports" were defined as sports
      where leanness or/and low bodyweight were considered important (e.g.
      cheerleading, swimming and gymnastics), and "non-leanness sports" were defined as
      sports where these factors are less important (e.g. football). Participants
      obtained a total mean score of 68.4 % for the nutrition knowledge part of the
      questionnaire. More specifically, less than 30 % of the coaches could answer
      correctly some general nutrition questions regarding carbohydrates and lipids. No
      significant difference in nutrition knowledge was observed between coaches from
      "leanness" and "non-leanness" sports or between men and women. Respondents with a
      university education scored higher than the others (73.3 % vs. 63.3 %, p < 0.05).
      Coaches who participated in coaching certification also obtained better results
      than those without a coaching certification. The most popular source of
      information about nutrition used by coaches was the Internet at 55 %. The two
      most popular nutrition practices that coaches recommended in order to improve
      athlete performance were hydration and consumption of protein-rich foods.
      Recommendation for nutritional supplements use was extremely rare and was
      suggested only by football coaches, a non-leanness sport. Findings from this
      study indicate that coaches need sports nutrition education and specific
      training.

PG  - 641-53
LID - 10.1080/02640414.2014.957714 [doi]
AB  - Abstract A nomological network on team dynamics in sports consisting of a
      multiframework perspective is introduced and tested. The aim was to explore the
      interrelationship among cohesion, team mental models (TMMs), collective efficacy 
      (CE) and perceived performance potential (PPP). Three hundred and forty
      college-aged soccer players representing 17 different teams (8 female and 9 male)
      participated in the study. They responded to surveys on team cohesion, TMMs, CE
      and PPP. Results are congruent with the theoretical conceptualisation of a
      parsimonious view of team dynamics in sports. Specifically, cohesion was found to
      be an exogenous variable predicting both TMMs and CE beliefs. TMMs and CE were
      correlated and predicted PPP, which in turn accounted for 59% of the variance of 
      objective performance scores as measured by teams' season record. From a
      theoretical standpoint, findings resulted in a parsimonious view of team
      dynamics, which may represent an initial step towards clarifying the
      epistemological roots and nomological network of various team-level properties.
      From an applied standpoint, results suggest that team expertise starts with the
      establishment of team cohesion. Following the establishment of cohesiveness,
      teammates are able to advance team-related schemas and a collective sense of
      confidence. Limitations and key directions for future research are outlined.

TI  - Effects of big-five personality traits on the quality of relationship and

LID - 10.1111/sms.12329 [doi]
AB  - The present study examined the influence of personality traits on the quality of 
      the Chinese coach-athlete relationship and satisfaction through a dyadic research
      design. A total of 350 coach-athlete dyads completed a self-report instrument
      that assessed personality traits, as well as perceptions of relationship quality 
      and satisfaction with training. Results revealed that: (a) actor effects (i.e.,
      actor's personality will predict his or her own perceptions of relationship
      quality) of personality traits, namely, conscientiousness, extroversion, and
      neuroticism, on both coaches' and athletes' perceptions of relationship quality
      and (b) partner effects (an actor's own personality will predict his or her
      partner's perceptions of relationship quality) of only athletes' personality,
      namely, conscientiousness, extroversion, and neuroticism, on their coaches'
      perceptions of relationship quality. The findings suggested that each
      relationship member's personality trait contributed independently to relationship
      quality, and both actor and partner effects of the relationship quality on
      satisfaction with training were found to be significant. In Chinese sports
      culture, there presents a unique dynamics of personality and relationship quality
      among coach-athlete dyad.

TI  - Metacognition and action: a new pathway to understanding social and cognitive
      aspects of expertise in sport.
PG  - 1155
LID - 10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01155 [doi]
AB  - For over a century, psychologists have investigated the mental processes of
      expert performers - people who display exceptional knowledge and/or skills in
      specific fields of human achievement. Since the 1960s, expertise researchers have
      made considerable progress in understanding the cognitive and neural mechanisms
      that underlie such exceptional performance. Whereas the first modern studies of
      expertise were conducted in relatively formal knowledge domains such as chess,
      more recent investigations have explored elite performance in dynamic
      perceptual-motor activities such as sport. Unfortunately, although these studies 
      have led to the identification of certain domain-free generalizations about
      expert-novice differences, they shed little light on an important issue: namely, 
      experts' metacognitive activities or their insights into, and regulation of,
      their own mental processes. In an effort to rectify this oversight, the present
      paper argues that metacognitive processes and inferences play an important if
      neglected role in expertise. In particular, we suggest that metacognition
      (including such processes as "meta-attention," "meta-imagery" and "meta-memory," 
      as well as social aspects of this construct) provides a window on the genesis of 
      expert performance. Following a critique of the standard empirical approach to
      expertise, we explore some research on "metacognition" and "metacognitive
      inference" among experts in sport. After that, we provide a brief evaluation of
      the relationship between psychological skills training and metacognition and
      comment on the measurement of metacognitive processes. Finally, we summarize our 
      conclusions and outline some potentially new directions for research on
      metacognition in action.

TI  - "I think they believe in me": the predictive effects of teammate- and
      classmate-focused relation-inferred self-efficacy in sport and physical activity 
      settings.
PG  - 486-505
LID - 10.1123/jsep.2014-0070 [doi]
AB  - Despite the prevalence of group-/team-based enactment within sport and physical
      activity settings, to this point the study of relation-inferred self-efficacy
      (RISE) has been focused upon estimations regarding a single target individual
      (e.g., one's coach). Accordingly, researchers have not yet considered whether
      individuals may also form RISE estimations regarding the extent to which the
      others in their group/team as a whole are confident in their ability. We applied 
      structural equation modeling analyses with cross-sectional and prospective data
      collected from members of interdependent sport teams (Studies 1 and 2) and
      undergraduate physical activity classes (Studies 3 and 4), with the purpose of
      exploring these group-focused RISE inferences. Analyses showed that group-focused
      RISE perceptions (a) predicted individuals' confidence in their own ability, (b) 
      were empirically distinct from conceptually related constructs, and (c) directly 
      and/or indirectly predicted a range of downstream outcomes over and above the
      effects of other efficacy perceptions. Taken together, these findings provide
      preliminary evidence that individuals' group-focused RISE appraisals may be
      important to consider when investigating the network of efficacy perceptions that
      develops in group-based physical activity contexts.

AB  - This investigation sought to clarify mixed results in the literature exploring
      coach behaviors, basic psychological needs, goal motivation, and well- and
      ill-being. Regional-level team sport athletes (N = 241) completed questionnaires 
      on the aforementioned variables at the beginning of the season. A subsample (n = 
      70) provided saliva samples to assess physical ill-being. At the end of the
      season, athletes (n = 98) reported their goal motivation and attainment.
      Structural equation modeling demonstrated that coach behaviors were related to
      needs satisfaction and thwarting, which were related to autonomous and controlled
      goal motives respectively. Autonomous motives were related to well- and
      ill-being; controlled motives were only related to ill-being. Over time, only
      end-of-season autonomous goal motives were related to goal attainment. The
      findings provide an insight into how coaches can facilitate optimum goal striving
      and well-being in their athletes.

TI  - Concussion management in United States college sports: compliance with National
      Collegiate Athletic Association concussion policy and areas for improvement.
PG  - 47-56
LID - 10.1177/0363546514553090 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2010, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) adopted 
      its Concussion Policy and Legislation, which applies to more than 450,000
      collegiate athletes annually. To date, there has been no examination of
      school-level compliance with the NCAA Concussion Policy. PURPOSE: To examine
      whether stakeholders at NCAA schools report that their school has a concussion
      management plan and whether existing plans are consistent with the NCAA policy.
      Also examined were stakeholders' perceptions regarding concussion management at
      their institution and possible areas for improvement. STUDY DESIGN:
      Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Surveys were sent by e-mail
      to coaches, sports medicine clinicians, and compliance administrators at all 1066
      NCAA member institutions. Surveys asked population-specific questions about
      institutional concussion management. Individuals (N=2880) from 907 unique schools
      participated in this survey. RESULTS: Most respondents (n=2607; 92.7%) indicated 
      their school had a concussion management plan. Most schools had all (82.1%) or
      some (15.2%) respondents indicate a concussion management plan was present. When 
      asked to indicate all individuals who could have final responsibility for
      returning athletes to play after a concussion, 83.4% selected team doctor, 72.8% 
      athletic trainer, 31.0% specialist physician, 6.8% coach, and 6.6% athlete. Most 
      respondents (76.1%) indicated that their institution had a process for annual
      athlete concussion education; 91.2% required athletes to acknowledge their
      responsibility to report concussion symptoms. Nearly all respondents (98.8%)
      thought their school's concussion management plan protected athletes "well" or
      "very well." Top categories suggested for improvement included better coach
      education (39.7%), increasing sports medicine staffing (37.2%), and better
      athlete education (35.2%). CONCLUSION: Although a large majority of respondents
      indicated that their school has a concussion management plan, improvement is
      needed. Compliance with specified components (eg, annual athlete education) lags 
      behind the presence of the plan itself, and stakeholders had suggestions for
      areas in which improvements are needed. Increasing scientific evidence supporting
      the seriousness of concussion underscores the need for the NCAA to use its
      regulatory capabilities to ensure that athletes' brains are safe.

TI  - Modifying factors in sports-related concussion: dangerous style of play.
PG  - 20-5
LID - 10.3810/psm.2014.09.2071 [doi]
AB  - In its third iteration, the Concussion in Sport Group identified 10 modifying
      factors that were presumed clinically to influence the investigation and
      management of concussions in sports. "Dangerous style of play" was delineated as 
      one of these factors, most likely based on clinical lore. These modifying factors
      were retained in a more recent Concussion in Sport Group statement. To date,
      there has been no concerted effort to support or refute the inclusion of this
      constellation of behaviors as a modifying factor in sports-related concussion.
      This article reviews and summarizes the limited evidence related to a dangerous
      style of play in sports-related concussion, offers a preliminary assessment of
      its relevance as a modifying factor, and provides additional information on other
      aspects of player, coach, and governing body behavior and their potential
      effect(s) on reducing concussive injuries.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to undertake a process evaluation to
      examine the reach, adoption and implementation of a school-community linked
      physical activity (PA) program for girls aged 12 - 15 years (School Years 7 - 9) 
      using the RE-AIM framework. METHODS: Various approaches were used to assess
      'reach', 'adoption' and implementation: (a) a school environment survey of
      intervention schools (n = 6); (b) teacher feedback regarding the professional
      development component (91.1% response rate) and lesson implementation (60.8%
      response rate); and (c) post-intervention focus group interviews with physical
      education (PE) teachers (n = 29), students (n = 125), coaches (n = 13) and
      instructors (n = 8) regarding program experiences. RESULTS: Reach and Adoption:
      Seven schools (n = 1491 Year 7-9 female student enrolment; 70% adoption rate),
      five tennis clubs, eight football clubs and five leisure centres participated in 
      the program during 2011. IMPLEMENTATION: Program design and professional
      development opportunities (training, resource manual and opportunities to work
      with coaches and instructors during PE classes) supported implementation and
      student engagement in PA. However, there was a lack of individual and
      organisational readiness to adopt program principles. For some deliverers there
      were deeply embedded ideologies that were not aligned with the Game Sense
      teaching approach upon which the program was based. Further, cognitive components
      of the program such as self-management were not widely adopted as other
      components of the program tended to be prioritised. CONCLUSION: The program
      design and resources supported the success of the program, however, some aspects 
      were not implemented as intended, which may have affected the likelihood of
      achieving further positive outcomes. Barriers to program implementation were
      identified and should be considered when designing school-community linked
      interventions. In particular, future programs should seek to assess and adjust
      for organizational readiness within the study design. For example, shared
      commitment and abilities of program deliverers to implement the program needs to 
      be determined to support program implementation. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

AB  - [Purpose] The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of injuries of
      children participating in sports, and to present advice on injury prevention.
      [Subjects and Methods] The study subjects were 445 children involved in sports
      with a mean age of 12.74+/-1.03 years, a mean height of 156.56+/-10.82 cm, and a 
      mean weight of 45.39+/-10.29 kg; 52.8% of the study subjects were male, and 47.2%
      were female. The subjects were surveyed using a questionnaire developed by the
      author. [Results] The highest incidence of sport injury was in the foot-ankle
      region, and the lowest incidence was in the hip-femur region. The incidences of
      injuries to the neck, shoulder, elbow, hand, wrist, superior dorsal region,
      waist, hip-femur region, knee, and foot-ankle regions weren't statistically
      significant. [Conclusion] This study established that children participating in
      competitive sports are at risk of injury. The causes of injuries were examined to
      propose preventive measures to minimize their occurrence and severity. It should 
      not be overlooked that injuries can occur more easily among children because
      their musculoskeletal system is not fully developed, and coaches should be
      educated in the appropriate training intensities for children.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Considering the importance of sport activity for enhancing quality of 
      life, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of regular sport
      activity on quality of life of kidney transplant recipients. METHODS:
      Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was assessed with the use of the SF-36
      questionnaire on a group of 118 active kidney transplant patients (AKTPs)
      practicing different sports at low to moderate intensity (5+/-4 h/wk). Scores
      were compared with those of 79 sedentary kidney transplant patients (SKTPs) and
      with 120 active healthy control subjects (AHCs). RESULTS: AKTPs reported higher
      scores than SKTPs in the SF-36 scales of Physical Functioning (P<.05), Role
      Limitations due to Physical Problems (P<.05), General Health (P<.01), Vitality
      (P<.05), Social Functioning (P<.05), Role Limitations due to Emotional Problems
      (P<.05), and Mental Health (P<.01). AKTPs obtained higher scores than AHCs on the
      Mental Health (P<.01) and Social Functioning scales (P<.01) and similar scores
      (P>.05) on all the other scales. The effect of quantity of sport activity was
      significant on the General Health (P<.01; eta2=0.05), and Role Physical scales
      (P=.04; eta2=0.03), with higher sport activity associated with higher HRQoL. The 
      effect of sex was significant for Bodily Pain (P=.05; eta2=0.02), Vitality
      (P=.08; eta2=0.06), Social Functioning (P=.08; eta2=0.05), and Mental Health
      (P=.05; eta2=0.02), with male participants scoring higher than female
      participants. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that regular sport activity
      significantly improves different dimensions of HRQoL among kidney transplant
      recipients. The benefits of sport activity go beyond its impact on physical
      health to involve psychologic and social components of quality of life.
      Spontaneous and low to moderate sport activity may play an important role after
      kidney transplantation that has been largely underestimated in the literature.

TI  - Multi center cohort study on association of genotypes with prospective sports
      concussion: methods, lessons learned, and recommendations.
AB  - This was a multicenter prospective cohort study designed to investigate a
      potential association between genetic polymorphisms of apolipoprotein E gene,
      apolipoprotein E promoter G219T, and two Tau gene exon 6 polymorphisms (Ser53Pro 
      and Hist47Tyr) with: (1) the risk of prospective concussion, (2) concussion
      severity, and (3) postconcussion neurocognitive recovery. Almost three thousand
      student athletes from 26 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division IA,
      II, III, and National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics academic
      institutions in the United States met inclusion criteria for this study. We
      assessed multiple variables including, gender, sport, family history of traumatic
      brain injury, history of mental illness, history of migraine headache, and
      baseline and postconcussion neuropsychological test results. Reported concussions
      were evaluated with multiple instruments including number of symptoms and symptom
      severity. Additionally, we gathered data via a questionnaire pertaining to
      medical history, demographics, and sportrelated information, and blood/saliva
      samples were collected for genetic analysis, and we conducted neuropsychological 
      testing using Headminder and ImPACT software. The goal of this paper is to share 
      our experiences conducting a large prospective cohort study. We recommend that
      future research include metaanalyses of various traumatic brain injury studies to
      increase power. Collaborative research is very likely needed given the nature of 
      this study population.

AB  - Exertional heat-related illness (EHRI) is comprised of several states that
      afflict physically active persons when exercising during conditions of high
      environmental heat stress. Certain forms of EHRI may become life threatening if
      not treated. Exertional heat stroke (EHS), characterized by a core body
      temperature of >40 degrees C and mental status changes, is the most severe form
      of EHRI. EHS must be treated immediately with rapid body cooling to reduce
      morbidity and mortality. Many EHRI cases are preventable by following heat
      acclimatization guidelines, modifying sports and exercise sessions during
      conditions of high environmental heat stress, maintaining adequate hydration,
      avoiding exertion in the heat when ill, and by educating sports medicine
      personnel, coaches, parents, and athletes on the early recognition and prevention
      of EHRI. Heat exhaustion, exercise-associated collapse, exercise-associated
      muscle cramps, exercise-associated hyponatremia, and exertional rhabdomyolysis
      are also described.

AB  - Facilitating the learning or relearning of motor tasks is one of the main goals
      of coaches, teachers and therapists. One promising way to achieve this goal is
      guiding the learner through the correct movement trajectory with the help of a
      robotic device. The aim of this study was to investigate if haptic guidance can
      induce long-lasting changes in the movement pattern of a complex sport-specific
      motor task. For this purpose, 31 subjects were assigned to one of three groups:
      EA (early angle, n=10), LA (late angle, n=11) and CON (control, n=10). EA and LA 
      successfully completed five training sessions, which consisted of 50 robot-guided
      golf swings and 10 free swings each, whereas CON had no training. The EA group
      was guided through the movement with the wrist being bent early during backswing,
      whereas in the LA group it was bent late. The participants of EA and LA were not 
      told about this difference in the movement patterns. To assess if the
      robot-guided training was successful in shaping the movement pattern, the timing 
      of the wrist bending during the backswing in free swings was measured before
      (PRE), one day after (POST), and 7 days after (FUP) the five training sessions.
      The ANOVA (timexgroupxangle) showed that during POST and FUP, the participants of
      the EA group bent their wrist significantly earlier during the backswing than the
      other groups. Post-hoc analyses revealed that this interaction effect was mainly 
      due to the differences in the wrist angle progression during the first 5 degrees 
      of the backswing. The robot-guided training was successful in shaping the
      movement pattern, and these changes persisted even after 7 days without further
      practice. This might have implications for the learning of complex motor tasks in
      general, as haptic guidance might quickly provide the beginner with an internal
      model of the correct movement pattern without having to direct the learner's
      attention towards the key points of the correct movement pattern.

AB  - As unstructured play declines, organized sports leagues have become a highly
      popular form of physical activity in young people. As concussive injuries are
      garnering increased media attention and public awareness, there is a growing
      concern for athlete safety. Although athletic trainers and physicians play a
      large role in keeping athletes healthy and safe, this article investigates
      nontraditional, multidisciplinary teams that are involved in promoting athlete
      safety, including the role of equipment makers, coaches, referees, governing
      bodies of sport, lawmakers, and fans. As opposed to a focus on diagnosing or
      managing concussive injuries, this article seeks to promote injury prevention
      strategies.

TI  - A survey of certification for cardiopulmonary resuscitation in high school
      athletic coaches.
PG  - 144-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can increase survival in
      instances of sudden cardiac arrest. Nationally, high school coaches are the first
      responders to sudden cardiac arrest in up to one-third of high school athlete
      collapses, but little is known about the status of their CPR certification. The
      primary goal of this study was to assess the proportion of Wisconsin high school 
      coaches that are certified in CPR. METHODS: A prospective web-based survey was
      developed and distributed to high school athletic directors in Wisconsin.
      RESULTS: Seventy-eight percent of respondents reported that coaches are the
      primary responders to a collapse. The majority of high schools do not require CPR
      certification and only 50% of coaches are currently CPR certified. Athletic
      directors with greater than 12 years of experience were the most likely to have
      an emergency action plan in place (P= 0.004). CONCLUSION: In Wisconsin, the
      proportion of coaches who act as the primary responder to a collapse is greater
      than previously reported. Although the majority of coaches in Wisconsin serve as 
      the primary responder to an episode of sudden cardiac arrest, only about 50% are 
      CPR certified. Due to the severe consequences of sudden cardiac arrest, CPR
      certification among coaches should be required.

PG  - 343-61
LID - 10.1123/apaq.2014-0142 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore youth sport experiences of individuals
      with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Participants were 6 males
      (mean age=22.7 yr) with ADHD who had played 3 or more seasons in team sports
      during adolescence. Following interpretive phenomenological analysis methodology,
      each participant completed 2 semistructured interviews. Findings showed that
      symptoms of ADHD hampered participants' experiences and led to negative
      interpersonal and performance-related consequences. On the other hand,
      participants reported social and stress/energy-release benefits arising from
      their experiences in sport. Their experiences were therefore complex, and some
      findings relating to social interactions appeared contradictory (e.g., negative
      interpersonal experiences vs. social benefits). Supportive coaches, understanding
      teammates, and personal coping strategies were key factors that enabled
      participants to realize benefits and, to some degree, mitigate negative
      consequences associated with their participation in sport.

TI  - Becoming a Coach in Developmental Adaptive Sailing: A Lifelong Learning
      Perspective.
PG  - 441-456
AB  - Life-story methodology and innovative methods were used to explore the process of
      becoming a developmental adaptive sailing coach. Jarvis's (2009) lifelong
      learning theory framed the thematic analysis. The findings revealed that the
      coach, Jenny, was exposed from a young age to collaborative environments. Social 
      interactions with others such as mentors, colleagues, and athletes made major
      contributions to her coaching knowledge. As Jenny was exposed to a mixture of
      challenges and learning situations, she advanced from recreational para-swimming 
      instructor to developmental adaptive sailing coach. The conclusions inform future
      research in disability sport coaching, coach education, and applied sport
      psychology.

TI  - The illusion of competency versus the desirability of expertise: seeking a common
      standard for support professions in sport.
PG  - 1-7
LID - 10.1007/s40279-014-0251-1 [doi]
AB  - In this paper we examine and challenge the competency-based models which
      currently dominate accreditation and development systems in sport support
      disciplines, largely the sciences and coaching. Through consideration of exemplar
      shortcomings, the limitations of competency-based systems are presented as
      failing to cater for the complexity of decision making and the need for proactive
      experimentation essential to effective practice. To provide a better fit with the
      challenges of the various disciplines in their work with performers, an
      alternative approach is presented which focuses on the promotion, evaluation and 
      elaboration of expertise. Such an approach resonates with important
      characteristics of professions, whilst also providing for the essential 'shades
      of grey' inherent in work with human participants. Key differences between the
      approaches are considered through exemplars of evaluation processes. The
      expertise-focused method, although inherently more complex, is seen as offering a
      less ambiguous and more positive route, both through more accurate representation
      of essential professional competence and through facilitation of future growth in
      proficiency and evolution of expertise in practice. Examples from the literature 
      are also presented, offering further support for the practicalities of this
      approach.

TI  - Coaches' Knowledge and Management of Eating Disorders: A Randomized Controlled
      Trial.
AB  - PURPOSE: It has been suggested that programs regarding early identification and
      prevention of eating disorders (ED) among athletes is unlikely to succeed without
      their coaches' endorsement and participation. Therefore, we developed a 1-yr
      intervention aiming to prevent the development of ED among adolescent elite
      athletes by targeting athletes and their coaches. The separate part of the
      intervention targeting the coaches was designed to provide knowledge and
      strategies regarding healthy nutrition, eating behavior, and ED (symptoms,
      identification, management and prevention). In this trial, we examined the effect
      of the educational program on the coaches' knowledge and management index in
      three content areas (nutrition, weight-regulation, and ED). We also examined
      their subjective evaluation of their ED knowledge. METHODS: All Norwegian Elite
      Sport High Schools were included (intervention group (n=9) and control group
      (n=7)). Seventy-six coaches employed at and coaching first-year student athletes 
      at the different schools were followed 3-school years (2008-2011). At pretest and
      posttest (9-months after intervention), they completed a questionnaire regarding 
      nutrition, weight-regulation, and ED. RESULTS: Intervention coaches had higher
      knowledge index scores than control coaches for weight-regulation (6.2+/-1.7 vs. 
      4.8+/-1.3, p<0.001), ED (including recognition and management) (19.3+/-4.4 vs.
      16.5+/-5.0, p=0.004), and total knowledge (weight-regulation, ED, and nutrition) 
      (35.0+/-7.2 vs. 31.6+/-8.0, p=0.021) at posttest. Moreover, the coaches
      likelihood of describing knowledge of ED as 'somewhat good' or better was 7 times
      higher for intervention- than control coaches at posttest (OR=7.1, 95% CI 2.2 -
      23.2, p=0.001). CONCLUSION: Intervention coaches had higher index scores on total
      knowledge, weight-regulation, and ED (including recognition and management) than 
      control coaches. The intervention also was successful in producing effects on the
      coaches' subjective evaluation of their ED knowledge.

TI  - Elite athletes' attitudes towards the use of placebo-induced performance
      enhancement in sports.
PG  - 1-7
AB  - Abstract While an increasing number of research is devoted to the understanding
      of placebo effects in sports, athletes' experiences with and attitudes towards
      the use of placebo for performance enhancement remain poorly understood. In this 
      study, 79 elite athletes from different sports were surveyed on five issues
      related to placebo use in sports. Results showed that 47% of the athletes have
      experienced placebo effects in the past. A majority of the athletes (82%) thought
      that placebos could affect their sports performances. A wider use of placebos in 
      sport settings was endorsed more by those who have experienced placebo effects in
      the past than those who did not (P = .005). Regardless of past experience with
      placebo, more than half of the athletes (53%) would accept an unknown but
      legitimate substance from the coach, and 67% of them would not mind a
      placebo-linked deception if that was effective. These findings confirm that most 
      elite athletes believe in the power of placebos in enhancing sports performance, 
      and those having a positive past experience exhibit slightly more favourable
      attitudes in contrast to those without such experiences.

TI  - A Randomized Controlled Study to Evaluate the Role of Video-Based Coaching in
      Training Laparoscopic Skills.
AB  - OBJECTIVE:: This study evaluates whether video-based coaching can enhance
      laparoscopic surgical skills performance. BACKGROUND:: Many professions utilize
      coaching to improve performance. The sports industry employs video analysis to
      maximize improvement from every performance. METHODS:: Laparoscopic novices were 
      baseline tested and then trained on a validated virtual reality (VR) laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy (LC) curriculum. After competence, subjects were randomized on a 
      1:1 ratio and each performed 5 VRLCs. After each LC, intervention group subjects 
      received video-based coaching by a surgeon, utilizing an adaptation of the GROW
      (Goals, Reality, Options, Wrap-up) coaching model. Control subjects viewed online
      surgical lectures. All subjects then performed 2 porcine LCs. Performance was
      assessed by blinded video review using validated global rating scales. RESULTS:: 
      Twenty subjects were recruited. No significant differences were observed between 
      groups in baseline performance and in VRLC1. For each subsequent repetition,
      intervention subjects significantly outperformed controls on all global rating
      scales. Interventions outperformed controls in porcine LC1 [Global Operative
      Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills: (20.5 vs 15.5; P = 0.011), Objective
      Structured Assessment of Technical Skills: (21.5vs 14.5; P = 0.001), and
      Operative Performance Rating System: (26 vs 19.5; P = 0.001)] and porcine LC2
      [Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills: (28 vs 17.5; P = 0.005),
      Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills: (30 vs 16.5; P < 0.001), and
      Operative Performance Rating System: (36 vs 21; P = 0.004)]. Intervention
      subjects took significantly longer than controls in porcine LC1 (2920 vs 2004
      seconds; P = 0.009) and LC2 (2297 vs 1683; P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS:: Despite
      equivalent exposure to practical laparoscopic skills training, video-based
      coaching enhanced the quality of laparoscopic surgical performance on both VR and
      porcine LCs, although at the expense of increased time. Video-based coaching is a
      feasible method of maximizing performance enhancement from every clinical
      exposure.

      organised youth sport?
PG  - e105960
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0105960 [doi]
AB  - Participation in organised youth sports (OYS) has been recommended as an
      opportunity to increase young peoples' physical activity (PA) levels. While
      coaches can potentially influence athletes' PA levels, what has not been explored
      is the question; do coaches perceive themselves as influential on PA for girls in
      OYS? Participants were 30 coaches of girls OYS teams aged 9-17 years in the
      Greater Sydney Metropolitan Area, Australia. Participants took part in a
      semi-structured interview that lasted approximately 30 minutes. They responded to
      questions regarding their perceived role as coaches, their perceptions of
      themselves as role models for PA, their views on their athletes' current PA
      levels, their opinions on improving their athletes' PA levels, and their
      perceived challenges as coaches in OYS. Many coaches considered themselves role
      models for PA due to their own involvement in organised sports. Coaches felt that
      they were conscious of girls' PA levels during training and could accurately
      gauge how active girls were. Coaches perceived their training sessions to provide
      sufficient PA and thus, did not feel the need to try to increase PA during
      training. Many coaches were cautious about conducting training sessions where the
      PA intensity was high for prolonged periods because they believed that it could
      potentially result in dropout from OYS. Coaches' perceived time commitment to
      OYS, variability of skill/experience amongst girls, and poor parental support as 
      major challenges they experienced in OYS. This study provided a unique insight
      from the perspective of coaches in OYS. Most coaches felt that they had the
      potential to influence PA for girls in OYS; however, coaches may underestimate or
      not fully realise the impact they can have on the girls they coach. Future
      research should focus on educating coaches to capitalise on the opportunity they 
      have to promote PA through OYS.

TI  - Sport Psychology Service Provision: Preferences for Consultant Characteristics
      and Mode of Delivery among Elite Malaysian Athletes.
PG  - 638-44
AB  - Factors relevant to the working alliance between athletes and sport psychology
      consultants were investigated in a sample of elite Malaysian athletes (n = 217). 
      The athletes represented a variety of team and individual sports, and they
      provided information about the perceived importance of seven consultant
      characteristics/behaviors as well as seven program delivery options. At a
      full-sample level, general preferences were expressed for consultants to lead a
      physically active lifestyle, regularly attend training sessions and competitions,
      and have prior experience as an athlete or coach. General preferences were also
      expressed for program content to be determined by the coach or consultant, and
      for regular, small doses of mental skills training to be delivered in a
      face-to-face context throughout the year. At a sub-group level, team sport
      athletes had stronger preferences than individual sport athletes for program
      delivery on a group/team basis, while individual sport athletes had stronger
      preferences than team sport athletes for having a role in determining program
      content. Findings are discussed in relation to dominant value themes within
      Malaysian society and the reinforcement of these themes within specific sport
      subcultures. Key pointsConsultant characteristics and program delivery methods
      have an impact on the effectiveness of sport psychology services.Preferred
      consultant characteristics and preferred methods of delivery may be affected by
      cultural and subcultural values.Elite Malaysian athletes prefer consultants to
      lead a physically active lifestyle; to regularly attend training/competition; and
      to have prior experience as an athlete or coach.Elite Malaysian athletes also
      prefer that the coach or consultant determine program content, and that mental
      skills training take place in a face-to-face context throughout the year.

      sport course.
PG  - 1440-50
LID - 10.1177/1049732314548596 [doi]
AB  - In the wake of recent wars, some military personnel face considerable physical
      and mental health problems. In this article I explore the effects of an adapted
      sport and inclusive adventurous training course for military personnel who have
      experienced physical injury and/or psychological trauma. Using a dialogical
      narrative approach, I analyzed stories shared by six soldiers during the course
      to explore the effects of involvement. Participation in the course seemed to
      facilitate a narrative transformation or opening corresponding to a broadening
      identity and sense of self. Story plots progressed from a failing monological
      narrative, through a chaos narrative, toward a dialogical quest narrative
      prioritizing immersion in an intense present, a developing self, and a relational
      orientation. On the basis of narrative theory, I suggest this transformation
      holds positive consequences for the health and well-being of military personnel
      who have experienced injury and/or trauma.

TI  - Taekwondo coaches knowledge about prevention and management of dental trauma.
PG  - 681-4
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess level of knowledge about prevention and
      dental trauma management among taekwondo coaches in Croatia. The questionnaire
      submitted to the taekwondo coaches contained 16 items about dental trauma
      prevention and management. The questionnaires were filled in by 131 taekwondo
      coaches; 28 females and 103 males. Descriptive statistics was used to describe
      and analyze the obtained data. The coaches were familiar with dental injuries in 
      high percentage: 41 (31.3%) have observed dental injury and 36 (27.5%) have
      experienced a dental injury themselves. Eight of them had tooth avulsion,
      fourteen crown fracture, and eight had tooth luxation. About half of all
      interviewed coaches 68 (52.7%) were aware of the possibility of replanting
      avulsed teeth. Twenty six (19.8%) were familiar with the tooth rescue kit. Only
      99 out of 131 coaches (75.6%) have used a mouthguard. The obtained results show
      low knowledge about possibilities for prevention of dental trauma. Insufficient
      use of mouthguards in this contact sport requires more attention of dentists and 
      coaches education about dental trauma prevention.

AB  - Physical activity in children is on the decline, leaving room for sedentary
      behaviour. Children are mentally over stimulated through the use of screens, but 
      their physical condition is diminishing. The benefits of physical activity in
      adults are well known. Although paediatric literature is less abundant, the
      benefits of regular physical activity in young children are real and extend into 
      adulthood. The promotion of physical activity can be made by any responsible
      adult in a child's entourage. It means clarifying the confusion between physical 
      activity and sport, evaluating the balance between the physical and sedentary
      behaviour of the children and their families and establishing with them the
      possible necessary changes. PAPRICA--young childhood is 4 hour interdisciplinary 
      training session approaching these various themes.

TI  - Sports-related head injuries in students: parents' knowledge, attitudes, and
      perceptions.
PG  - 194-9
AB  - The short- and long-term neurologic impairment of children sustaining
      sports-related head injuries has recently entered the forefront of medical
      literature, resulting in new guidelines on concussion management being provided
      to clinicians, coaches, and trainers. Yet, most parents have not been formally
      educated on head injuries. The purpose of this article is to share the findings
      of a study conducted with 235 parents that identified their knowledge, attitudes,
      and perceptions of sports-related head injuries in school-age students. The study
      found that 51% of respondents were unaware that head trauma was more serious in
      children, 80% were uninformed as to whether the school district had a policy on
      sports-related head injuries, 44% did not know if there were medical guidelines
      for return to play, and 35% did not know that repeated head trauma could cause
      dementia. Results of this research implore school nurses to improve patient and
      parental education when they care for and monitor students with head injuries.

AB  - Learning a sports skill is a complex process in which practitioners are
      challenged to cater for individual differences. The main purpose of this study
      was to explore the effectiveness of a Nonlinear Pedagogy approach for learning a 
      sports skill. Twenty-four 10-year-old females participated in a 4-week
      intervention involving either a Nonlinear Pedagogy (i.e.,manipulation of task
      constraints including equipment and rules) or a Linear Pedagogy (i.e.,
      prescriptive, repetitive drills) approach to learn a tennis forehand stroke.
      Performance accuracy scores, movement criterion scores and kinematic data were
      measured during pre-intervention, post-intervention and retention tests. While
      both groups showed improvements in performance accuracy scores over time, the
      Nonlinear Pedagogy group displayed a greater number of movement clusters at
      post-test indicating the presence of degeneracy (i.e., many ways to achieve the
      same outcome). The results suggest that degeneracy is effective for learning a
      sports skill facilitated by a Nonlinear Pedagogy approach. These findings
      challenge the common misconception that there must be only one ideal movement
      solution for a task and thus have implications for coaches and educators when
      designing instructions for skill acquisition.

TI  - A team fares well with a fair coach: Predictors of social loafing in interactive 
      female sport teams.
LID - 10.1111/sms.12303 [doi]
AB  - The present research aimed to develop and test a theoretical model that links
      players' perceived justice of the coach to a more optimal motivational climate,
      which in turn increases players' team identification and cohesion, and results in
      lower levels of social loafing in female sport teams. Belgian elite female
      basketball, volleyball, and football players (study 1; N = 259; Mage = 22.6) and 
      Norwegian world-class female handball players (study 2; N = 110; Mage = 22.8)
      completed questionnaires assessing players' perceived justice (distributive and
      procedural), motivational climate, team identification, team cohesion (task and
      social), and social loafing (perceived and self-reported). In both studies,
      confirmatory and exploratory path analyses indicated that perceived justice was
      positively related to a mastery climate (P < 0.05) and negatively to a
      performance climate (P < 0.05). In turn, a mastery climate was linked to
      increased levels of team identification (P < 0.05) and task cohesion (P < 0.05). 
      Consequently, players' perceived and self-reported social loafing decreased (P < 
      0.05). The findings of both independent studies demonstrated the impact of
      coaches' fairness, and consequently, the motivational climate created by the
      coach on the optimal functioning of female sport teams.

TI  - Age-predicted vs. measured maximal heart rate in young team sport athletes.
PG  - 314-20
LID - 10.4103/0300-1652.137192 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although maximal heart rate (HR)max is used widely to assess exercise
      intensity in sport training and particularly in various team sports, there are
      limited data with regards to the use of age-based prediction equations of HRmax
      in sport populations. The aim of this study was to compare the measured-HRmax
      with three prediction equations (Fox-HRmax = 220-age and Tanaka-HRmax =
      208-0.7xage and Nikolaidis-HRmax = 223-1.44xage) in young team sport athletes.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Athletes of soccer, futsal, basketball and water polo,
      classified into three age groups (u-12, 9-12 years, n = 50; u-15, 12-15 years, n 
      = 40; u-18, 15-18 years, n = 57), all members of competitive clubs, voluntarily
      performed a graded exercise field test (20 m shuttle run endurance test) to
      assess HRmax. RESULTS: Fox-HRmax and Nikolaidis-HRmax overestimated
      measured-HRmax, while Tanaka-HRmax underestimated it (P < 0.001). However, this
      trend was not consistent when examining each group separately; measured-HRmax was
      similar with Tanaka-HRmax in u-12 and u-15, while it was similar with
      Nikolaidis-HRmax in u-18. CONCLUSION: The results of this study failed to
      validate two widely used and one recently developed prediction equations in a
      large sample of young athletes, indicating the need for specific equation in
      different age groups. Therefore, coaches and fitness trainers should prefer
      Tanaka-HRmax when desiring to avoid overtraining, while Fox-HRmax and
      Nikolaidis-HRmax should be their choice in order to ensure adequate exercise
      intensity.

TI  - Building successful student-athlete coach relationships: examining coaching
      practices and commitment to the coach.
PG  - 383
LID - 10.1186/2193-1801-3-383 [doi]
AB  - In this study we utilized the concept of commitment to explain the impact of
      coaching practices on student-athlete's behaviour. We examined the impact of
      commitment to the coach on the coaching outcome of in-role behaviour, and the
      influence of coaching practices, of information sharing, training, and
      encouraging teamwork, on the formation of relationships. We adopted measures from
      the organizational behaviour literature and surveyed student-athletes at two
      universities in Canada. The sample included data from 165 student-athletes from
      two universities. Results from structural equation modeling indicate support for 
      the effect of coaching practices on commitment to the coach. Results also support
      the effect of commitment to the coach on the student-athletes' role behaviour and
      performance. By showing that coaching practices impact commitment to the coach,
      and that commitment to the coach impacts student-athlete role behaviour and
      performance, the findings have important implications for a better understanding 
      of the determinants of coaches' and athletes' performance. The managerial
      significance of this research rests in the insight provided into how coaching
      practices influence athlete's behaviour through commitment to the coach. This
      study contributes to the literature on coach-athlete relationship within
      universities and colleges by applying the concept of commitment to the coach.
      This helps diversity research approaches to understanding coach-athlete
      relationships and extends prior research on commitment by looking at the context 
      of the relationship between the student-athlete and their coach.

      practice in rehabilitation programs.

LID - 10.3389/fnhum.2014.00469 [doi]
AB  - Motor imagery (MI) is a commonly used paradigm for the study of motor learning or
      cognitive aspects of action control. The rationale for using MI training to
      promote the relearning of motor function arises from research on the functional
      correlates that MI shares with the execution of physical movements. While most of
      the previous studies investigating MI were based on simple movements in the
      present study a more attractive mental practice was used to investigate cortical 
      activation during MI. We measured cerebral responses with functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) in twenty three healthy volunteers as they imagined
      playing soccer or tennis before and after a short physical sports exercise. Our
      results demonstrated that only 10 min of training are enough to boost MI patterns
      in motor related brain regions including premotor cortex and supplementary motor 
      area (SMA) but also fronto-parietal and subcortical structures. This supports
      previous findings that MI has beneficial effects especially in combination with
      motor execution when used in motor rehabilitation or motor learning processes. We
      conclude that sports MI combined with an interactive game environment could be a 
      promising additional tool in future rehabilitation programs aiming to improve
      upper or lower limb functions or support neuroplasticity.

      Scale in the sport context.

LID - 10.7334/psicothema2014.76 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this research was to translate into Spanish and
      examine the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the Controlling
      Coach Behaviors Scale (CCBS) in male soccer players. The CCBS is a questionnaire 
      designed to assess athletes' perceptions of sports coaches' controlling
      interpersonal style from the perspective of the self-determination theory.
      METHOD: Study 1 tested the factorial structure of the translated scale using
      confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and provided evidence of discriminant
      validity. Studies 2 and 3 examined the invariance across time and across
      competitive level via multi-sample CFA. Reliability analyses were also conducted.
      RESULTS: The CFA results revealed that a four-factor model was acceptable,
      indicating that a controlling interpersonal style is a multidimensional construct
      represented by four separate and related controlling coaching strategies.
      Further, results supported the invariance of the CCBS factor structure across
      time and competitive level and provided support for the internal consistency of
      the scale. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the CCBS demonstrated adequate internal
      consistency, as well as good factorial validity. The Spanish version of the CCBS 
      represents a valid and reliable adaptation of the instrument, which can be
      confidently used to measure soccer players' perceptions of their coaches'
      controlling interpersonal style.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine awareness/knowledge of the Triad
      and its health implications among female high school athletes and their coaches, 
      and to evaluate coaches' Triad screening/intervention practices. DESIGN:
      Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Two high schools in the western United States.
      PARTICIPANTS: Female athletes from a variety of sports (N = 240) ages 14-18 years
      and their coaches (N = 10). INTERVENTION: Participants completed surveys that
      assessed Triad knowledge and athlete Triad risk factors. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
      Frequency of responses to Triad knowledge, Triad risk factor, and Triad
      education/screening procedures questions; athlete summative knowledge score.
      RESULTS: Half (N = 120) of participants reported menstrual irregularity, and 42% 
      (N = 101) had 2 or more Triad risk factors: past amenorrhea (N = 39), past stress
      fracture (N = 41), self-reported not eating enough (N = 53), underweight
      (BMI-for-age < 5(th) percentile) (N = 10), pressure to be a certain weight (N =
      143), and wanting to lose >10 pounds when self-reported weight was in a healthy
      range (N = 34). Average athlete Triad knowledge score was 2.97 +/- 1.61 out of 8.
      Coach Triad knowledge was limited; however, most (9/10) were comfortable
      discussing menstruation with their athletes. Barriers to Triad
      screening/education were coaches' insufficient time, knowledge, and educational
      resources. CONCLUSION: Triad risk factors were prevalent among athletes and coach
      and athlete Triad knowledge was low. Providing coaches with Triad
      screening/education training may increase Triad knowledge and decrease Triad risk
      among high school athletes.

TI  - Enhancing life prospects of socially vulnerable youth through sport
      participation: a mixed methods study.
PG  - 703
LID - 10.1186/1471-2458-14-703 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sport participation has been associated with improved life prospects 
      such as academic performance and employability prospects. As such, promoting
      sport participation might be a way to increase life prospects, especially for
      socially vulnerable youth because they are less physically active than their
      peers. However, the evidence for the causal effect of sport participation on
      these outcomes is still limited and little is known about factors that play a
      role in this possible effect. The aim of this study is four-fold. First, the
      causal effect of sport participation on life prospects is studied and the
      underlying mechanisms of this relation are explored. Secondly, the life
      experiences of the youngsters in the sport context, that may contribute to skill 
      development, are studied. Thirdly, social conditions for a positive effect are
      explored, as sport is likely to have a positive effect under specific conditions.
      Fourthly, this study aims to provide insights on the elements of successful
      partnerships between youth care organisations and local sport clubs. METHODS AND 
      DESIGN: This protocol reports on a mixed method study. An intervention that aims 
      to increase the sport participation of socially vulnerable youth, between 12-23
      years old, is implemented in three regions of a Rotterdam youth care
      organisation. The youngsters in the two control regions receive care-as-usual.
      The main outcome variables, collected via questionnaires, are the life prospect, 
      sense of coherence and self-regulation skills of the youngsters after 6 and 18
      months of follow-up. The Motivational Climate Scale is administered to explore
      the social conditions for a positive effect and interviews are conducted with
      sport coaches to explore their role in skill development. Interviews with the
      youngsters are conducted to gain insight on the life experiences that may lead to
      skill development. The elements of successful partnerships are collected during
      interviews with youth care professionals, sport coaches and other stakeholders in
      the sport context. DISCUSSION: The results of this study can support efforts of
      youth care organisations and local sport clubs to improve the life prospects of
      socially vulnerable youth through sport participation. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Knowledge and management of sports concussions among coaches and certified
      athletic trainers in Alabama.
PG  - 418-23

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify modifiable barriers in resources, knowledge, and
      management that may improve the care of young athletes with concussions in the
      state of Alabama. METHODS: An electronic survey was distributed to 2668 middle
      and high school coaches of contact sports in Alabama, and a paper survey was
      completed by 79 certified athletic trainers (ATCs) in 2010. Questions focused on 
      their resource availability, knowledge of concussions based on the 2008 Consensus
      Statement on Concussion in Sport: the 3rd International Conference on Concussion 
      in Sport (commonly known as the Zurich consensus statement), and management of
      concussions. RESULTS: A total of 402 (16% response rate) coaches and 55 ATCs (70%
      response rate) responded to the survey. This study highlights that ATC coverage
      often is limited to the high school level, football, and competitions. Both
      coaches and ATCs primarily use physicians to make return-to-play decisions,
      although coaches (43.7%) usually refer to primary care physicians, whereas ATCs
      (43.6%) refer to orthopedic or sports medicine physicians. The study also
      revealed that coaches and ATCs desire education and could expand concussion
      awareness by providing education to parents and athletes. No overall difference
      was seen in the knowledge and management of concussions between coaches and ATCs;
      however, ATCs were more likely to identify symptoms that are positive for
      concussions (P = 0.04). Both groups had difficulty recognizing subtle symptoms
      such as trouble sleeping, personality changes, and dizziness; they also were
      unaware that strenuous mental activities could delay concussion recovery,
      although ATCs scored significantly better than coaches (P < 0.001). Neither
      coaches nor ATCs consistently use standardized measures such as the Sports
      Concussion Assessment Tool 2 (7.5% vs 56.4%) or neuropsychological testing (5.3% 
      vs 14.5%). CONCLUSIONS: This study describes coaches' and ATCs' varying knowledge
      and management techniques and highlights areas in which targeted interventions
      and outreach could be useful. These areas include increased ATC availability,
      coach/ATC concussion education, improved parent/athlete education, increased
      "return to think" awareness, and more consistent use of Sports Concussion
      Assessment Tool 2.

      concussion.
PG  - 352-8
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000000613 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the ethical and legal issues physicians face when
      evaluating and managing athletes with sports-related concussions, and to offer
      guidance to physicians as they navigate these situations. RESULTS: This position 
      paper reviews and compares the components of sports-related concussion laws,
      including education, removal from play, and clearance for return to play. It
      highlights the challenges privacy laws present relevant to providing care to
      concussed athletes and suggests ways to help physicians overcome these obstacles.
      The report also explores the ethical considerations physicians should bear in
      mind as they evaluate and manage concussed athletes, addressing them through a
      framework that includes considerations of professionalism, informed
      decision-making, patient autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, conflicts of
      interest, and distributive justice. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians caring for concussed 
      athletes have an ethical obligation to ensure that their primary responsibility
      is to safeguard the current and future physical and mental health of their
      patients. Physicians have a duty to provide athletes and their parents with
      information about concussion risk factors, symptoms, and the risks for
      postconcussion neurologic impairments. Physicians should facilitate informed and 
      shared decision-making among athletes, parents, and medical teams while
      protecting athletes from potential harm. Additionally, including concussion
      evaluation and management training in neurology residency programs, as well as
      developing a national concussion registry, will benefit patients by the
      development of policies and clinical guidelines that optimize prevention and
      treatment of concussive head injury.

PG  - 395-404
LID - 10.5014/ajot.2014.011221 [doi]
AB  - In this study, we conducted a pretest-posttest investigation of a sports-oriented
      occupational therapy intervention using surfing in an experiential, skills-based 
      program to support veterans with symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
      in their transition to civilian life. The purpose of this feasibility study was
      to evaluate the intervention for attendance rates and retention in the program
      provided in 5 sessions over 5 wk. Fourteen veterans from a specialty
      postdeployment clinic at a Veterans Affairs hospital were enrolled; 11 completed 
      the study, and 10 attended >/=3 sessions. Participants reported clinically
      meaningful improvement in PTSD symptom severity (PTSD Checklist-Military Version,
      Wilcoxon signed rank Z = 2.5, p = .01) and in depressive symptoms (Major
      Depression Inventory, Wilcoxon signed rank Z = 2.05, p = .04). The results of
      this small, uncontrolled study suggest that a sports-oriented occupational
      therapy intervention has potential as a feasible adjunct intervention for
      veterans seeking mental health treatment for symptoms of PTSD.

TI  - Responses of track and field coaches to athletes with eating problems.
LID - 10.1111/sms.12286 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to explore how track and field coaches respond to athletes with 
      eating problems. Eleven experienced coaches participated in semi-structured
      interviews exploring their responses to, and challenges faced when, working with 
      athletes with eating problems. The analysis revealed three themes relating to the
      strategies employed by coaches. The first theme indicated a supportive approach, 
      where coaches were proactive in seeking support and in reducing training at the
      early stages of an eating problem. The second theme outlined an avoidant
      approach, characterized by coach reluctance to be involved in managing eating
      problems, and a lack of confidence in their knowledge of eating disorders. The
      third theme involved a confrontational approach, where coaches employed strict
      rules and engaged in coercion to persuade athletes to seek treatment. All of the 
      coaches reported facing challenges in persuading athletes to seek treatment and
      were frustrated by the lack of available support. The study highlights the
      importance of providing resources and support services where coaches can seek
      advice. Coach-education packages can utilize the findings to highlight the
      strengths and limitations of different coach strategies, and to reinforce the
      importance of their role in identification and intervention when eating problems 
      in athletes are suspected.

TI  - Physical fitness and mental health impact of a sport-for-development intervention
      in a post-conflict setting: randomised controlled trial nested within an
      observational study of adolescents in Gulu, Uganda.
PG  - 619
LID - 10.1186/1471-2458-14-619 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity contributes to poor fitness and mental health
      disorders. This is of concern in post-conflict low-income settings where
      non-communicable diseases are emerging and there is limited evidence for physical
      activity interventions. We examined the effects of a sport-for-development
      programme on adolescent physical fitness and mental health in Gulu, Uganda.
      METHODS: We conducted a single-blinded RCT nested within an observational study
      with three unbalanced parallel groups. Participants were able-bodied adolescents 
      aged 11-14 years. The intervention comprised an 11-week voluntary competitive
      sport-for-development football league. Participants who did not subscribe for the
      intervention formed a non-registered comparison group. Boys who registered for
      the sport-for-development programme were randomly allocated to the intervention
      or wait-listed. The girls programme subscription was insufficient to form a
      wait-list and all registrants received the intervention. Physical fitness was
      assessed by cardiorespiratory fitness (multi-stage fitness test), muscular power 
      (standing broad jump) and body composition (BMI-for-age). Mental health was
      measured using the Acholi Psychosocial Assessment Instrument for local
      depression-like (DLS) and anxiety-like (ALS) syndromes. All randomisation was
      computer generated and assessors were masked to group allocation. An
      intention-to-treat analysis of adjusted effect size (ES) was applied. RESULTS:
      There were 1,462 adolescents in the study (intervention: boys = 74, girls = 81;
      wait-list: boys = 72; comparison: boys = 472, girls = 763). At four months
      follow-up there was no significant effect on the boys fitness when comparing
      intervention vs wait-listed and intervention vs non-registered groups. However,
      there was a negative effect on DLS when comparing boys intervention vs
      wait-listed (ES = 0.67 [0.33 to 1.00]) and intervention vs non-registered (ES =
      0.25 [0.00 to 0.49]). Similar results were observed for ALS for boys intervention
      vs wait-listed (ES = 0.63 [0.30 to 0.96]) and intervention vs non-registered (ES 
      = 0.26 [0.01 to 0.50]). There was no significant effect on the girls for any
      outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The sport-for-development league in this study had no
      impact on fitness and a negative effect on the mental health of participating
      boys. From this research, there is no evidence that voluntary competitive
      sport-for-development interventions improve physical fitness or mental health
      outcomes in post-conflict settings.

TI  - The secondary school football coach's relationship with the athletic trainer and 
      perspectives on exertional heat stroke.
PG  - 469-77
LID - 10.4085/1062-6050-49.3.01 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Prior researchers have examined the first-aid knowledge and decision
      making among high school coaches, but little is known about their perceived
      knowledge of exertional heat stroke (EHS) or their relationships with an athletic
      trainer (AT). OBJECTIVE: To examine secondary school football coaches' perceived 
      knowledge of EHS and their professional relationship with an AT. DESIGN:
      Qualitative study. SETTING: Web-based management system. PATIENTS OR OTHER
      PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-eight secondary school head football coaches (37 men, 1
      woman) participated in this study. Their average age was 47 +/- 10 years old, and
      they had 12 +/- 9 years' experience as a head football coach. DATA COLLECTION AND
      ANALYSIS: Participants responded to a series of online questions that were
      focused on their perceived knowledge of EHS and professional relationships with
      ATs. Data credibility was established through multiple-analyst triangulation and 
      peer review. We analyzed the data by borrowing from the principles of a general
      inductive approach. RESULTS: Two dominant themes emerged from the data: perceived
      self-confidence of the secondary school coach and the influence of the AT. The
      first theme highlighted the perceived confidence, due to basic emergency care
      training, of the coach regarding management of an emergency situation, despite a 
      lack of knowledge. The second theme illustrated the secondary school coach's
      positive professional relationships with ATs regarding patient care and emergency
      procedures. Of the coaches who participated, 89% (34 out of 38) indicated
      positive interactions with their ATs. CONCLUSIONS: These secondary school coaches
      were unaware of the potential causes of EHS or the symptoms associated with EHS, 
      and they had higher perceived levels of self-confidence in management abilities
      than indicated by their perceived knowledge level. The secondary school football 
      coaches valued and understood the role of the AT regarding patient and emergency 
      care.

AB  - PURPOSE: This longitudinal study examined the association between participation
      in school sport during adolescence and mental health in early adulthood. METHODS:
      Adolescents (n = 853) reported participation in school sport in each grade
      throughout the 5 years of secondary school. In early adulthood, participants
      reported depressive symptoms, level of stress, and self-rated mental health.
      RESULTS: Involvement in school sport during adolescence was a statistically
      significant predictor of lower depression symptoms, lower perceived stress, and
      higher self-rated mental health in young adulthood. CONCLUSIONS: School sport
      participation may protect against poor mental health in early adulthood. Policies
      to increase school sport participation may be warranted as part of public health 
      strategies to promote mental health.

TI  - Premature return to play and return to learn after a sport-related concussion:
      physician's chart review.
PG  - e310, e312-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine what proportion of patients experience an exacerbation of
      their symptoms as a result of premature return to play (RTP) and return to learn 
      (RTL) following sport-related concussions. DESIGN: Retrospective study of
      electronic medical records from the office-based practice of one family and sport
      medicine physician who had systematically provided recommendations for cognitive 
      and physical rest based on existing consensus recommendations. Two blinded
      authors independently reviewed each chart, which included Sport Concussion
      Assessment Tool (SCAT) and SCAT2 symptom self-report forms to determine whether
      an athlete had returned to play or learn prematurely. If there was a discrepancy 
      between the 2 reviewers then a third author reviewed the charts. SETTING: A sport
      medicine and family practice in Ontario. The physician assessed sport-related
      concussions after self-referral or referral from other primary care physicians,
      teams, and schools. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 170 charts of 159 patients were
      assessed for sport-related concussion during a 5-year period (April 2006 to March
      2011). All participants were students who were participating in sports at the
      time of injury. There were 41 concussions in elementary students, 95 concussions 
      in high school students, and 34 concussions in college or university students.
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Premature RTP and RTL were defined as chart records
      documenting the recurrence or worsening of symptoms that accompanied the
      patients' RTP or RTL. Measures were compared using the earliest available SCAT
      forms and self-reporting. RESULTS: In 43.5% of concussion cases, the patient
      returned to sport too soon and in 44.7% of concussion cases, the patient returned
      to school too soon. Patients with a history of previous concussion required more 
      days of rest before being permitted to participate in any physical activity than 
      those patients without a previous history of concussion. Elementary school
      students required fewer days of rest before being permitted to return to any
      physical activity compared with high school students and college or university
      students. CONCLUSION: Currently, physicians recommend restrictions on mental and 
      physical activity following sport-related concussion. This is done without clear 
      guidelines as to what cognitive rest entails for students. Further research is
      required to determine how to implement a management plan for student athletes to 
      facilitate complete recovery after concussion.

TI  - [Sport and rheumatoid arthritis].
PG  - 434-8
LID - 10.1007/s00393-013-1341-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sport is becoming increasingly more important in our society. Due to 
      the changing age spectrum with a greater number of elderly and substantially more
      active people, an increasing number of people with underlying orthopedic diseases
      are becoming interested in participating in sport. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This
      article deals with the possibilities and effects of sporting activities for
      people with rheumatoid arthritis within the framework of a conservative therapy. 
      A literature search was carried out using medical search engines, in particular
      PubMed, and also via the recommendations of specialist societies and patient help
      groups. RESULTS: The quality of life of patients with rheumatoid arthritis
      consists of physical, mental and social components. Sport as a means of
      rehabilitation influences all of these components. Sport should be comprehended
      as a form of therapy and be adapted to the needs of the individual patient. The
      willingness to actively participate in sport should always be highly rated and
      encouraged. Sport is therefore an important pillar of therapy in a conservative
      total concept. The main aspects of sport therapeutic activities are functional,
      pedagogical and experience-oriented aspects. The clinical symptoms, extent of
      damage and physical impairment must, however, be evaluated and taken into
      consideration for the therapeutic concept. CONCLUSION: The amount of data on the 
      complex topic of sport and rheumatoid arthritis is low and is mainly dealt with
      as retrospective reviews. A prospective randomized study basis is lacking. The
      aim must therefore be to confirm the currently available recommendations for
      various types of sport in controlled studies.

      anterior cruciate ligament injury of the knee.
LID - 10.1111/sms.12249 [doi]
AB  - Aim of the study was to access how individual's motives for participation in
      sports impact on self-reported outcomes 2 years after an anterior cruciate
      ligament injury. Based on a longitudinal cohort study, this secondary analysis
      present data from the Knee Anterior Cruciate Ligament, Nonsurgical versus
      Surgical Treatment (KANON) study, a randomized controlled trial. At baseline, 121
      patients recorded in an initial questionnaire that their motives for sports
      participation fell into four categories: achievement, health, social integration,
      or fun and well-being. These four categories were used as variables in the
      analyses. All 121 subjects completed the 2-year follow-up. The largest
      improvement was seen in the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)
      subscale sports and recreation function, with an effect size of 2.43. KOOS sports
      and recreation function was also the subscale score best predicted by the motives
      for sports participation. Baseline motives achievement and fun and well-being
      predicted worse levels of pain and function 2 years after the injury, even after 
      adjusting for age, gender, treatment and baseline scores. Psychological aspects, 
      such as motives for participation in sport, can be factors in predicting of
      patient-reported outcomes 2 years after injury. Evaluating motives for sports
      participation may help predict the outcome 2 years after ACL injury.

      performance and psychological health.
PG  - 281-92
LID - 10.1123/jsep.2013-0260 [doi]
AB  - We argue that basic psychological needs theory (BPNT) offers impetus to the value
      of mental toughness as a mechanism for optimizing human functioning. We
      hypothesized that psychological needs satisfaction (thwarting) would be
      associated with higher (lower) levels of mental toughness, positive affect, and
      performance and lower (higher) levels of negative affect. We also expected that
      mental toughness would be associated with higher levels of positive affect and
      performance and lower levels of negative affect. Further, we predicted that
      coaching environments would be related to mental toughness indirectly through
      psychological needs and that psychological needs would indirectly relate with
      performance and affect through mental toughness. Adolescent cross-country runners
      (136 male and 85 female, M(age) = 14.36) completed questionnaires pertaining to
      BPNT variables, mental toughness, and affect. Race times were also collected. Our
      findings supported our hypotheses. We concluded that BPNT is generative in
      understanding some of the antecedents and consequences of mental toughness and is
      a novel framework useful for understanding mental toughness.

      evaluated the technical quality and content validity of 20 items developed from
      semistructured interviews. Thirteen items were selected for Study 1, which tested
      the factorial validity and reliability scores of coaches' (n = 343) responses to 
      the CIPS items. An eight-item structure, consisting of two factors (centrality
      and evaluative emotions) was selected as the final CIPS measure, which was
      examined with a final sample of coaches (n = 454) in Study 2 to evaluate the
      factorial validity, group invariance, concurrent validity, and nomological
      validity of respondents' scores to the CIPS. Initial evidence for the various
      types of validity and reliability tested across the studies was provided.

TI  - Small-sided games in team sports training: a brief review.
PG  - 3594-618
LID - 10.1519/JSC.0000000000000564 [doi]
AB  - Small-sided games (SSGs) incorporating skills, sport-specific movements, at
      intensities sufficient to promote aerobic adaptations, are being increasingly
      implemented in professional team sport environments. Small-sided games are often 
      employed by coaches based on the premise that the greatest training benefits
      occur when training simulates the specific movement patterns and physiological
      demands of the sport. At present, there is relatively little information
      regarding how SSG can best be used to improve physical capacities and technical
      and tactical skills in team sports. It is possible that with some modifications
      (e.g., number of players, pitch size, coach encouragement, and wrestling), such
      games may be physiologically beneficial for athletes with relatively high initial
      aerobic fitness levels. For instance, it has been shown that 3-a-side soccer SSG 
      resulted in higher intensity (i.e., greater overall distance, less jogging and
      walking, higher heart rate, and more tackling, dribbling, goal attempts, and
      passes) than 5-a-side SSG. Likewise, when player numbers were kept constant, a
      larger playing area increased the intensity of the SSG with a smaller playing
      area having the opposite effect. It has also been demonstrated that energy
      expenditure was similar between badminton and volleyball courts, but lower than
      that obtained in a basketball court. Moreover, it has been demonstrated in rugby 
      that wrestling can increase the physical demands of SSG. Consistent coach
      encouragement can also increase training intensity, although most rule changes
      have trivial or no effect on exercise intensity. Further research is required to 
      examine the optimal periodization strategies of SSG training for the long-term
      development of physiological capacity, technical skill, and tactical proficiency,
      while also minimizing the associated risk of injuries.

PG  - 1738-50
LID - 10.1080/02640414.2014.918641 [doi]
AB  - In this longitudinal study, we examined the extent to which perceived coach- and 
      peer-created motivational climates are associated with athlete-group cohesion and
      satisfaction with participation among Spanish soccer players competing in the
      Third National Division. Multilevel modelling analyses showed that perceived
      coach-created task climate was positively related to perceived cohesion and
      players' satisfaction with their participation within their team. Also, perceived
      peer-created task climate related positively to perceived cohesion. The results
      indicate the importance of considering peer-related aspects of the motivational
      climate in addition to considering the coach-related aspects of the motivational 
      climate when examining motivational group dynamics in sport.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This paper assessed the associations between sports participation and
      the development of psychological strengths and difficulties during childhood.
      DESIGN: Two-year follow up study of a sample of 4042 Australian children who were
      followed from age 8 years to 10 years. METHODS: Parents reported children's
      participation in organised sports, and completed the Strengths and Difficulties
      Questionnaire. Univariate general linear models were used to examine the
      association between changes in sports participation and psychological strengths
      and difficulties at 10 years, adjusting for psychological strengths and
      difficulties at age 8. RESULTS: Children who maintained participation in sport
      had lower rates of parent-reported psychological difficulties at 10 years
      compared with children who dropped out of sport. Less internalising problems were
      also reported for children who participated in organised sports compared to
      children who dropped out of sports and children who did not participate in
      sports. These relationships did not differ by BMI, socioeconomic status, or
      parental education. CONCLUSIONS: Greater psychological difficulties are
      experienced by children who drop out of sports, and greater social and emotional 
      problems are experienced by children who drop out of sports and who do not
      participate in organised sports. Due consideration should be given to the quality
      and implementation of sporting programs to ensure that they provide benefits to
      mental health. Due consideration should also be given to the potential
      psychological difficulties being experienced by children who drop out of
      organised sports as a higher level of psychological difficulties may be
      experienced prior to or subsequent to dropout.

TI  - Recognizing and managing concussion in school sport.
PG  - E25-32
LID - 10.1097/JNN.0000000000000063 [doi]
AB  - Every country around the world enjoys some sort of sport. The Olympics sees
      countries from all over the globe participate in elite sport, in both winter and 
      summer competitions. Australia is widely known for cricket and rugby; America is 
      known for baseball and gridiron football (among others). These sports are played 
      at an elite level as well as beginners from early ages as young as 4 years in the
      backyard. Yet, it is also these sports that can deliver a ball at the speed of
      100 km/h (football), 105 km/h (baseball), 112 km/h (rugby), 150 km/h (cricket),
      and 211 km/h (soccer). This is the same force that a car collision can produce.
      That force eventually finds a target, and in some cases, unfortunately, it is a
      head. Damage to the brain is not only from the impact of the ball hitting its
      target but rather also the shearing forces of acceleration-deceleration injury
      that can cause extensive injuries. There has been much discussion of late
      regarding concussion in sport and the accumulative effects of head blows
      resulting in varying degrees of memory loss and dementia later in life. The media
      have been saturated with heightened awareness of chronic traumatic
      encephalopathy. This, however, is still being researched. It is true that each
      concussion compounds the one before, but rather than focus on the injury,
      managers/coaches and sporting codes should be focusing on the identification and 
      proper management of a suspected concussion and the return-to-play protocols.
      This is especially important in our schools where growing brains need nurturing. 
      Neuroscience nurses are at the forefront of educating school children, teachers, 
      and coaches through partnering with local schools. This article will focus on
      concussion recognition and management in school sport.

TI  - Injuries associated with combat sports, active component, U.S. Armed Forces,
      2010-2013.
PG  - 16-8
AB  - The practice of combat sports creates a potential for training- and
      sports-related injuries among military members. During the 4-year surveillance
      period, there were 12,108 cases of injuries associated with combat sports among
      active component service members; the overall incidence rate was 21.0 per 10,000 
      person-years (p-yrs). The rates were higher among service members who were male, 
      Hispanic, in the youngest age groups, in the Army, junior enlisted, and in
      combat-specific occupations. The rate among recruit/ trainees (779.4 per 10,000
      p-yrs) was more than 165 times the rate among all other active component service 
      members (non-recruits) (4.7 per 10,000 p-yrs). Sprains, strains, and contusions
      accounted for more than one-half of the primary (first-listed) diagnoses
      associated with combat sports cases. More serious conditions such as
      concussions/head injuries and skull/face fractures/intracranial injuries were
      reported among 3.9% and 2.1% of all cases and were more common among
      boxing-related cases. Hand/wrist fractures were also common among boxing cases.
      Wrestling had comparatively greater proportions of dislocations and open wounds. 
      Although the combat sport training provides many physical and mental benefits to 
      the individual, safety practices should be enforced to reduce the most frequent
      and serious injuries.

TI  - Adolescent male hazardous drinking and participation in organised activities:
      Involvement in team sports is associated with less hazardous drinking in young
      offenders.
PG  - 28-41
LID - 10.1002/cbm.1912 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a lack of research investigating organised activity
      participation and associated alcohol use in vulnerable groups. AIMS: The purpose 
      of this research was to test and compare associations between participation in
      organised activities and indicators of hazardous drinking between young offenders
      and young non-offenders. METHODS: Two groups of 13-18 year-old males were
      recruited in Cardiff, UK: 93 young offenders and 53 non-offenders from secondary 
      schools matched on estimated IQ, sex and socioeconomic status. Indicators of
      hazardous drinking were measured using the Fast Alcohol Screening Test (FAST).
      Organised activity participation and externalising behaviour was measured by the 
      Youth Self Report. The Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence was also
      administered. RESULTS: Young offenders participated in fewer organised activities
      and had higher FAST scores than non-offenders. Young offenders and non-offenders 
      significantly differed on mean FAST scores if they participated in no organised
      activities but not if they participated in at least one team sport. Externalising
      behaviour problems were unrelated to participation in organised activities.
      CONCLUSIONS: Although young offenders were less likely to have participated in
      organised activities, for them, participation in a team sport was associated with
      less hazardous drinking. Vulnerable youths who might benefit most from sporting
      activities actually access them the least. Future research should identify the
      different barriers to participation that they face. (c) 2014 The Authors.

TI  - Sport commitment and participation in masters swimmers: the influence of coach
      and teammates.
PG  - 852-60
LID - 10.1080/17461391.2014.915990 [doi]
AB  - This study investigated how coach and teammates influence masters athletes' sport
      commitment, and the effect of functional and obligatory commitments on
      participation in masters swimming. The sample consisted of 523 masters swimmers
      (330 males and 193 females) aged between 22 and 83 years (M = 39.00, SD = 10.42).
      A bi-dimensional commitment scale was used to measure commitment dimensions and
      perceived influence from social agents. Structural equation modelling analysis
      was conducted to evaluate the influence of social agents on functional and
      obligatory commitments, and the predictive capabilities of the two types of
      commitment towards sport participation. Support provided by coach and teammates
      increased functional commitment, constraints from these social agents determined 
      higher obligatory commitment, and coach constraints negatively impacted
      functional commitment. In addition, both commitment types predicted training
      participation, with functional commitment increasing participation in team
      training sessions, and obligatory commitment increasing the hours of individual
      training. The findings suggest that in order to increase participation in masters
      swimming teams and reduce non-supervised training, coach and teammates should
      exhibit a supportive attitude and avoid over expectation.

TI  - Pediatric sports specific return to play guidelines following concussion.
PG  - 242-55
AB  - PURPOSE/BACKGROUND: In 2010, the American Academy of Pediatrics officially
      adopted the recommended return to play guidelines proposed by the International
      Conference on Concussion in Sport. The guidelines include a six-step process that
      provides structure to guide an athlete who is recovering from a concussion in a
      gradual return to play (RTP) by allowing participation in increasingly difficult 
      physical activities. Unfortunately, the guidelines fail to take into account the 
      variability that occurs within different sports and the resulting challenges
      medical professionals face in making sure each athlete is able to withstand the
      rigors of their specific sport, without return of symptoms. Therefore, the
      purpose of this clinical commentary is to expand upon the current general
      consensus guidelines for treatment of concussed pediatric athletes and provide
      sport specific RTP guidelines. DESCRIPTION OF TOPIC: The intention of the sport
      specific guidelines is to maintain the integrity of the current six-step model,
      add a moderate activity phase highlighted by resistance training, and to provide 
      contact and limited contact drills specific to the athlete's sport and/or
      position. The drills and activities in the proposed seven-step programs are
      designed to simulate sport specific movements; the sports include: football,
      gymnastics, cheerleading, wrestling, soccer, basketball, lacrosse, baseball,
      softball, and ice hockey. These activities will provide sports specific
      challenges to each athlete while simultaneously accomplishing the objectives of
      each stage of the RTP progression. The final RTP determination should occur with 
      documented medical clearance from a licensed healthcare provider who has been
      trained in the evaluation and management of concussions. DISCUSSION/RELATION TO
      CLINICAL PRACTICE: There have been significant strides in the management and care
      of concussed athletes. However, there continues to be a lot of confusion among,
      athletes, parents, and coaches regarding the proper management of an athlete with
      a concussion, particularly in the pediatric population. In an effort to eliminate
      ambiguity and help further promote adherence to the RTP guidelines, the authors
      developed several sports-specific RTP guidelines. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 5.

TI  - The Fun Integration Theory: Towards Sustaining Children and Adolescents Sport
      Participation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Children cite 'fun' as the primary reason for participation in
      organized sport and its absence as the number one reason for youth sport
      attrition. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop a theoretical
      framework of fun using a novel mixed-method assessment of participants in sport
      (FUN MAPS) via concept mapping. METHODS: Youth soccer players (n = 142), coaches 
      (n = 37), and parents (n = 57) were stratified by age, sex, and competition level
      and contributed their "fun" ideas through: (a) qualitative brainstorming,
      identifying all of the things that make playing sports fun for players; (b)
      sorting of ideas; and (c) rating each idea on its importance, frequency, and
      feasibility. RESULTS: The FUN MAPS identify the four fundamental tenets of fun in
      youth sport within 11 fun-dimensions composed of 81 specific fun-determinants,
      while also establishing the youth sport ethos. CONCLUSION: The FUN MAPS provide
      pictorial evidence-based blueprints for the fun integration theory (FIT), which
      is a multi-theoretical, multidimensional, and stakeholder derived framework that 
      can be used to maximize fun for children and adolescents in order to promote and 
      sustain an active and healthy lifestyle through sport.

TI  - Increasing girls' physical activity during an organised youth sport basketball
      program: a randomised controlled trial protocol.
PG  - 383
LID - 10.1186/1471-2458-14-383 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Participation in organised youth sports (OYS) has been recommended as
      an opportunity to increase young peoples' moderate-to-vigorous physical activity 
      (MVPA) levels. Participants, however, spend a considerable proportion of time
      during OYS inactive. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to investigate
      whether coaches who attended coach education sessions (where education on
      increasing MVPA and decreasing inactivity during training was delivered) can
      increase players' MVPA during training sessions over a 5-day basketball program
      compared to coaches who did not receive coach education sessions. METHODS/DESIGN:
      A convenience sample of 80 female players and 8 coaches were recruited into the
      UWS School Holiday Basketball Program in Greater Western Sydney, Australia. A
      two-arm, parallel-group randomised controlled trial was employed to investigate
      whether coaches who attended 2 coach education sessions (compared with a
      no-treatment control) can increase their players' MVPA during training sessions
      over a 5-day basketball program. Objectively measured physical activity, directly
      observed lesson context and leader behaviour, player motivation, players'
      perceived autonomy support, and coaching information (regarding training session 
      planning, estimations on player physical activity and lesson context during
      training, perceived ability to modify training sessions, perceived importance of 
      physical activity during training, intention to increase physical activity/reduce
      inactivity, and likelihood of increasing physical activity/reducing inactivity)
      were assessed at baseline (day 1) and at follow-up (day 5). Linear mixed models
      will be used to analyse between arm differences in changes from baseline to
      follow-up on all outcomes. DISCUSSION: The current trial protocol describes, to
      our knowledge, the first trial conducted in an OYS context to investigate the
      efficacy of an intervention, relative to a control, in increasing MVPA. This
      study's findings will provide evidence to inform strategies targeting coaches to 
      increase MVPA in OYS, which could have major public health implications, given
      the high proportion of children and adolescents who participate in OYS globally. 
      TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand
      Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12613001099718.

TI  - Applied sport science of rugby league.
PG  - 1087-100
LID - 10.1007/s40279-014-0190-x [doi]
AB  - Rugby league is a team sport in which players engage in repeated high-intensity
      exercise involving frequent collisions. Recent research, much of which has
      involved global positioning system (GPS) technology, has provided coaches and
      sport scientists with a deeper understanding of match demands, particularly at
      the elite level. This has allowed for the development of training programmes that
      prepare players for the most intense contact and running demands likely to be
      experienced in competition. At the elite level, rugby league players have
      well-developed aerobic and anaerobic endurance, muscular strength and power,
      reactive agility, and speed. Upper- and lower-body strength and aerobic power are
      associated with a broad range of technical and sport-specific skills, in addition
      to a lower risk of injury. Significant muscle damage (as estimated from creatine 
      kinase concentrations) and fatigue occurs as a result of match-play; while muscle
      function and perceptual fatigue generally return to baseline 48 h following
      competition, increases in plasma concentrations of creatine kinase can last for
      up to 5 days post-match. Well-developed physical qualities may minimise
      post-match fatigue and facilitate recovery. Ultimately, the literature highlights
      that players require a broad range of physical and technical skills developed
      through specific training. This review evaluates the demands of the modern game, 
      drawing on research that has used GPS technology. These findings highlight that
      preparing players based on the average demands of competition is likely to leave 
      them underprepared for the most demanding passages of play. As such, coaches
      should incorporate drills that replicate the most intense repeated high-intensity
      demands of competition in order to prepare players for the worst-case scenarios
      expected during match-play.

TI  - Nutritional knowledge of UK coaches.
PG  - 1442-53
LID - 10.3390/nu6041442 [doi]
AB  - Athletes obtain nutritional information from their coaches, yet their competency 
      in this area is lacking. Currently, no research exists in the UK which has a
      different coach education system to many other countries. Therefore, the aim of
      this study was to evaluate the sports nutrition knowledge of UK coaching
      certificate (UKCC) level 2 and 3, hockey and netball qualified coaches. All
      coaches (n = 163) completed a sports nutrition questionnaire to identify: (a) if 
      they provided nutritional advice; (b) their level of sport nutrition knowledge;
      and (c) factors that may have contributed to their level of knowledge. Over half 
      the coaches provided advice to their athletes (n = 93, 57.1%), even though they
      were not competent to do so. Coaches responded correctly to 60.3 +/- 10.5% of all
      knowledge questions with no differences between those providing advice and those 
      who did not (p > 0.05). Those coaches who had undertaken formal nutrition
      training achieved higher scores than those who had not (p < 0.05). In conclusion,
      UK sports coaches would benefit from continued professional development in sports
      nutrition to enhance their coaching practice.

TI  - Medical and psychosocial needs of Olympic and Pan American athletes after the
      2010 earthquake in Haiti: an opportunity to promote resilience through sports
      medicine and public diplomacy.
PG  - 195-9
LID - 10.1017/S1049023X14000302 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: On January 12, 2010, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake devastated Haiti.
      Data regarding the prevalence of medical and psychosocial needs after the
      earthquake is scarce, complicating informed targeting of aid. The effects of the 
      earthquake on athletes, as they differ from the general population, are
      especially unclear. The Center for Disaster Resilience (Boston, Massachusetts
      USA) and the Disaster Medicine Section at Harvard Medical School (Boston,
      Massachusetts USA) have partnered with Child in Hand to care for athletes
      training for the Pan American and Olympic games in Haiti, as well as for children
      from the general population. This report presents preliminary epidemiologic data 
      illustrating the burden of medical and psychosocial needs of Haitian athletes and
      the general population after the earthquake of 2010. METHODS: The study was a
      cross-sectional, comparative study conducted a year after the earthquake. The
      study group comprised 104 athletes, aged 12-18 years, enrolled from the National 
      Sports Center in Haiti. The control group (N = 104) from the general population
      was age- and gender-matched from orphanages and schools in and around
      Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Medical teams assessed illness based on history and
      physicals. Psychosocial teams utilized the Child Psychosocial Distress Screener
      (CPDS). Two-proportion z tests and two-sample t tests were used to compare the
      proportions of medical illnesses, mean CPDS scores, and proportion of CPDS scores
      indicating treatment. RESULTS: The most prevalent medical condition in athletes
      was musculoskeletal pain, which was more common than in controls (49% versus
      2.9%). All other medical conditions were more common in the controls than
      athletes: abdominal pain (28.8% versus 4.8%); headache (22.1% versus 5.8%); fever
      (15.4% versus 1%); and malnutrition (18.3% versus 1.9%). In contrast, there was
      no significant difference in mean psychosocial scores and the proportion of
      scores indicating treatment between athletes and controls. CONCLUSION: Elite
      athletes in Haiti have a low prevalence of most medical conditions after the
      disaster, suggesting that they may be protected from risk factors affecting the
      general population. However, athletes have a higher prevalence of musculoskeletal
      ailments and were not protected from psychosocial distress. This presents an
      opportunity for sports medicine physicians and mental health providers to engage 
      in efforts to rebuild Haiti on an individual level by providing targeted care to 
      athletes, and on a larger scale, by supporting international sports competition, 
      which enhances human capital and facilitates public diplomacy.

      experience. In this article, we discuss psychological resilience in sport
      performers via a review of the stressors athletes encounter and the protective
      factors that help them withstand these demands. It is hoped that synthesising
      what is known in these areas will help researchers gain a deeper profundity of
      resilience in sport, and also provide a rigorous and robust foundation for the
      development of a sport-specific measure of resilience. With these points in mind,
      we divided the narrative into two main sections. In the first section, we review 
      the different types of stressors encountered by sport performers under three main
      categories: competitive, organisational and personal. Based on our recent
      research examining psychological resilience in Olympics champions, in the second 
      section we discuss the five main families of psychological factors (viz. positive
      personality, motivation, confidence, focus, perceived social support) that
      protect the best athletes from the potential negative effect of stressors. It is 
      anticipated that this review will help sport psychology researchers examine the
      interplay between stressors and protective factors, which will, in turn, focus
      the analytical lens on the processes underlying psychological resilience in
      athletes.

AB  - Training programs for high school athletes have changed over the last 20 years.
      High school physical education classes have transformed into sport-specific
      conditioning classes with intensities matching college or professional athlete
      programming. In addition, involvement in private, sport-specific, training
      increased; but despite these advanced training methods, are high school athletes 
      prepared for collegiate sport competition? An anonymous survey was sent to 195
      Division I strength and conditioning coaches (SCC) to discern incoming college
      freshman athletes' physical and psychological preparedness for the rigors of
      collegiate training and sport competition. Fifty-seven (29%) responses were
      received. Strength and conditioning coaches stated that incoming college freshman
      athletes lack lower extremity strength, overall flexibility, and core strength as
      well as proper Olympic lifting technique. Strength and conditioning coaches also 
      stated that athletes lacked the mental toughness to endure collegiate sport
      training in addition to claiming incoming athletes lacked knowledge of correct
      nutrition and recovery principles. These results suggest a lack of collegiate
      training/sport preparedness of high school athletes. High school strength and
      conditioning specialist's goal is to produce better athletes and doing so
      requires the strength and conditioning coach/trainer to have knowledge of how to 
      train high school athletes. One way to assure adequate knowledge of strength and 
      conditioning training principles is for high school coaches/trainers to be
      certified in the field. Strength and conditioning certifications among high
      school strength and conditioning coaches/trainers would encourage developmentally
      appropriate training and would provide universities with athletes who are
      prepared for the rigors of collegiate sport training/competition.

      implications for athlete's well-being.
PG  - 1454-64
LID - 10.1080/02640414.2014.898183 [doi]
AB  - This study examined whether athletes' attachment styles with the coach were
      linked to aspects of the coach-athlete relationship quality and, in turn, whether
      relationship quality was linked to athletes' well-being. One hundred and
      ninety-two athletes completed a questionnaire measuring their attachment styles
      and relationship quality with the coach as well as their feelings of positive
      affect (PA) and negative affect (NA). Structural equation modelling (SEM)
      analysis found athletes' avoidant and secure attachment styles to be associated
      with aspects of coach-athlete relationship quality such as social support,
      relationship depth, and interpersonal conflict. Interpersonal conflict appeared
      to play a key role in athletes' PA and NA. From a practical perspective, an
      understanding of conflict management could provide a resource that allows
      athletes (and coaches) to enhance the quality of their sporting relationships.
      Specifically, an awareness of proactive strategies (e.g., steps to clarify
      expectations) and reactive strategies (e.g., cooperation during the discussion of
      disagreements) could potentially lead both coaches and athletes to "broaden"
      their viewpoints and in turn "build" connections that are capable of generating
      positive emotions including interest, excitement, happiness, and zeal.

TI  - A systematic review of core implementation components in team ball sport injury
      prevention trials.
PG  - 357-62
LID - 10.1136/injuryprev-2013-041087 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, the use of specific exercise programmes to prevent
      musculoskeletal injuries in team ball sports has gained considerable attention,
      and the results of large-scale, randomised controlled trials have supported their
      efficacy. To enhance the translation of these interventions into widespread use, 
      research trials must be reported in a way that allows the players, staff and
      policymakers associated with sports teams to implement these interventions
      effectively. In particular, information is needed on core implementation
      components, which represent the essential and indispensable aspects of successful
      implementation. OBJECTIVES: To assess the extent to which team ball sport injury 
      prevention trial reports have reported the core implementation components of the 
      intervention, the intervention target and the use of any delivery agents (ie,
      staff or other personnel delivering the intervention). To summarise which
      specific types of intervention, intervention target and delivery agents are
      reported. To develop consensus between reviewers on the reporting of these
      components. METHODS: Six electronic databases were systematically searched for
      English-language, peer-reviewed papers on injury prevention exercise programme
      (IPEP) trials in team ball sports. The reporting of all eligible trials was
      assessed by two independent reviewers. The reporting of the three core
      implementation components were coded as 'yes', 'no' or 'unclear'. For cases coded
      as 'yes', the specific types of interventions, intervention targets and delivery 
      agents were extracted and summarised. RESULTS: The search strategy identified 52 
      eligible trials. The intervention and the intervention target were reported in
      all 52 trials. The reporting of 25 trials (48%) specified the use of delivery
      agents, the reporting of three trials (6%) specified not using delivery agents,
      and in the reporting of the remaining 24 trials (46%) the use of delivery agents 
      was unclear. The reported intervention type was an IPEP alone in 43 trials (83%),
      education/instruction in how to deliver an IPEP in three trials (6%) and multiple
      types of interventions (including an IPEP) in six trials (12%). Players were the 
      most commonly reported intervention target (88%, n=46), followed by multiple
      targets (8%, n=4) and coaches (4%, n=2). Of the 25 trials for which delivery
      agents were reported, 13 (52%) reported a single type of delivery agent and 12
      (48%) multiple types. The types of delivery agents reported included coaches,
      physiotherapists, athletic trainers and team captains. CONCLUSIONS: The current
      reporting of core implementation components in team ball sport IPEP trials is
      inadequate. In many trial reports, it is unclear whether researchers delivered
      the IPEP directly to players themselves or engaged delivery agents (eg, coaches, 
      physiotherapists, athletic trainers) to deliver the programme. When researchers
      do interact with delivery agents, the education/instruction of delivery agents
      should be acknowledged as an intervention component and the delivery agents as an
      intervention target. Detailed reporting of implementation components in team ball
      sport IPEP trials will facilitate the successful replication of these
      interventions by intended users in practice and by researchers in other studies.

TI  - Identifying core, exciting, and hybrid attributes in fans' assessments of major
      (World Cup) spectator sports events.
PG  - 786-803
AB  - This paper adopts a methodology of asymmetrical analyses to investigate the
      relevant importance of spectator sport attributes in terms of their non-linear
      associations with the benefits that fans experience while watching sports.
      Questionnaires tapping 16 attributes (e.g., teamwork, sportsmanship, level of
      competition) and 16 benefits (e.g., good mood, exciting experience, support for
      my favorite team) were distributed to a sample of fans at the outdoor broadcast
      of the 2010 World Cup final game at the National Stadium in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.
      427 participants rated the importance and benefit of each attribute experienced
      from watching the game. Attributes were categorized as core, exciting, or hybrid 
      attributes. The star player was the core attribute; rivalry, popularity, and
      coach were the exciting attributes; and the other 12 attributes were hybrid.
      Two-dimensional space analyses showed that attributes "sportsmanship, teamwork,
      and supporting a team" were both explicitly and implicitly important attributes. 
      The methodology of asymmetrical analyses can help managers prioritize the focus
      of attributes and allocate resources effectively.

AB  - Interpersonal feedback from coaches may be instrumental in the formation of
      children's self-efficacy to learn or perform sport skills. We report on two
      studies that explored perceived sources of self-efficacy and relation-inferred
      self-efficacy (RISE) in one-on-one interviews with sport camp participants (N =
      61; ages 7-12) and focus groups with recreational league participants (N = 28;
      ages 8-12). Participants' responses indicated that prior experiences and socially
      constructed interactions contributed to the development of self-efficacy and RISE
      beliefs. Results support Bandura's (1997) theorizing that self-efficacy is
      developed through processing of experiential feedback as well as Lent and Lopez's
      (2002) tripartite theory proposing interpersonal feedback from influential others
      contributes to children's RISE and self-efficacy.

PG  - 720-9
LID - 10.1080/17461391.2014.901419 [doi]
AB  - People's implicit beliefs of ability have been suggested as an antecedent of
      achievement goal adoption, which has in turn been associated with behavioural,
      cognitive and affective outcomes. This study examined a conditional process model
      with team sport athletes' approach-avoidance achievement goals as mediators
      between their implicit beliefs of sport ability and sport-related cognitive
      anxiety. We expected gender to moderate the paths from implicit beliefs of
      ability to approach-avoidance goals and from approach-avoidance goals to
      cognitive anxiety. Team sport athletes with a mean age of 20 years (163 females
      and 152 males) responded to questionnaires about their implicit beliefs of sport 
      ability, approach-avoidance goals and sport-related cognitive anxiety.
      Incremental beliefs, gender and the interaction between them predicted
      mastery-approach goals. Gender also predicted mastery-avoidance goals, with
      females reporting higher levels than males. Mastery-avoidance goals, gender and
      the interaction between them predicted cognitive anxiety, with females reporting 
      higher levels of anxiety than males. Entity beliefs positively predicted
      performance-avoidance goals and the interaction between performance-approach and 
      gender predicted anxiety. The indirect effects also showed gender differences in 
      relation to performance-approach goals. Taken together, our results suggest that 
      coaches trying to create a facilitating climate for their male and female
      athletes may be wise to consider their athletes' anxiety and achievement goal
      patterns as these may affect both the athletes' well-being and performance.

TI  - Athletes confessions: The sports biography as an interaction ritual.
LID - 10.1111/sms.12198 [doi]
AB  - Commercialization of emotions is not a new phenomenon but in Denmark there is a
      new general trend to tell and sell personal stories in the media. Personal
      deprivation and crises are also major topics in sports media. This paper focuses 
      on sports biographies as a book genre that is reviving in popularity. The paper
      approaches the topic through the biographies of one Danish athlete: the former
      professional cyclist, Jesper Skibby, who writes about his doping disclosure and
      shares his personal dilemmas as a former elite sportsman. The thematic text
      analysis orientates around social interactions, emotions, and personality
      constructions. Inspired by microsociology with a Durkheimian flavor of Goffman
      and Hochschild, themes including "face work," "interaction rituals," and
      "emotions management" are discussed. The analysis claims that sharing personal
      information in the media is not only a means of confession and reclaiming status 
      but is also business and management - on an intimate level. Telling the story of 
      the corrosion of a sporting character has become a hot issue, an entertainment,
      and not least a commercial commitment.

TI  - Disordered eating and eating disorders in aquatic sports.
PG  - 450-9
LID - 10.1123/ijsnem.2014-0029 [doi]
AB  - Disordered eating behavior (DE) and eating disorders (EDs) are of great concern
      because of their associations with physical and mental health risks and, in the
      case of athletes, impaired performance. The syndrome originally known as the
      Female Athlete Triad, which focused on the interaction of energy availability,
      reproductive function, and bone health in female athletes, has recently been
      expanded to recognize that Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S) has a
      broader range of negative effects on body systems with functional impairments in 
      both male and female athletes. Athletes in leanness-demanding sports have an
      increased risk for RED-S and for developing EDs/DE. Special risk factors in
      aquatic sports related to weight and body composition management include the
      wearing of skimpy and tight-fitting bathing suits, and in the case of diving and 
      synchronized swimming, the involvement of subjective judgments of performance.
      The reported prevalence of DE and EDs in athletic populations, including athletes
      from aquatic sports, ranges from 18 to 45% in female athletes and from 0 to 28%
      in male athletes. To prevent EDs, aquatic athletes should practice healthy eating
      behavior at all periods of development pathway, and coaches and members of the
      athletes' health care team should be able to recognize early symptoms indicating 
      risk for energy deficiency, DE, and EDs. Coaches and leaders must accept that
      DE/EDs can be a problem in aquatic disciplines and that openness regarding this
      challenge is important.

TI  - The myth of the team captain as principal leader: extending the athlete
      leadership classification within sport teams.
PG  - 1389-97
LID - 10.1080/02640414.2014.891291 [doi]
AB  - Although coaches and players recognise the importance of leaders within the team,
      research on athlete leadership is sparse. The present study expands knowledge of 
      athlete leadership by extending the current leadership classification and
      exploring the importance of the team captain as formal leader of the team. An
      online survey was completed by 4,451 participants (31% females and 69% males)
      within nine different team sports in Flanders (Belgium). Players (N = 3,193) and 
      coaches (N = 1,258) participated on all different levels in their sports. Results
      revealed that the proposed additional role of motivational leader was perceived
      as clearly distinct from the already established roles (task, social and external
      leader). Furthermore, almost half of the participants (44%) did not perceive
      their captain as the principal leader on any of the four roles. These findings
      underline the fact that the leadership qualities attributed to the captain as the
      team's formal leader are overrated. It can be concluded that leadership is spread
      throughout the team; informal leaders rather than the captain take the lead, both
      on and off the field.

PG  - 66-70
LID - 10.1097/JSA.0000000000000010 [doi]
AB  - When treating hand and wrist injuries, there is often an opportunity to allow an 
      athlete to return to play before complete healing of the injury and/or surgery.
      Protective devices can make this possible. The risks of returning to play in this
      manner depend on many factors including the injury itself, position played, hand 
      dominance, etc. Communication between treating health care professional, athlete,
      trainer, and coaches is critical in this decision process. Protective options
      include taping, custom-made splints, commercially available braces, soft casts,
      and hard casts. Ability to use these devices during competition is governed by
      the rules of each individual sport and often dependent on final approval by
      referee or game official.

TI  - Factors affecting sports-related orofacial injuries and the importance of
      mouthguards.
PG  - 777-83
LID - 10.1007/s40279-014-0167-9 [doi]
AB  - Sports dentistry is one of the most recent and upcoming fields in dentistry. It
      includes mainly the prevention and management of sports-related orofacial
      injuries and associated oral diseases or traumas. The dentist can play a critical
      role in informing athletes, coaches, and patients and their parents about the
      importance of prevention, treatment, and diagnosis for orofacial injuries in
      sports. The most significant aspect in preventing sports-related orofacial
      injuries is wearing basic protective devices such as properly fitting helmets,
      face masks, and/or mouthguards. A properly fitted mouthguard prevents violent
      contact between the upper and lower dentition. According to the American Society 
      for Testing and Materials, there are three types of mouthguards:
      custom-fabricated mouthguards, mouth-formed guards, and stock mouthguards.
      Essential properties of the various materials used in the manufacture of
      mouthguards include water absorption, density, and thickness as well as
      temperature transmission, energy absorption, and drawing strength (tensile
      strength) of custom-made mouthguards. Currently, a variety of materials is being 
      used for mouthguards, most commonly polyvinyl acetate-polyethylene copolymer or
      ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer and polyvinyl chloride. Mouthguard use is
      significant for athletes, since dentists play an important role in the design and
      application of these in clinical practice. The purpose of this article is to
      review the importance of mouthguard use, the incidence and location of orofacial 
      sports injuries, the risk factors for such injuries, and the types of mouthguards
      and their roles in the prevention of sports-related orofacial injuries.

TI  - The Relationship between Coaches' and Athletes' Competitive Anxiety,and their
      Performance.
PG  - 68-76
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to survey the relationship between coaches'
      and athletes' competitive anxiety, and their performance. METHODS: This is a
      descriptive correlational study performed using a demographic questionnaire, an
      athletic performance checklist, and sport competition anxiety test designed by
      Martens consisting of 15 questions. The study population consisted of 540 players
      and 60 coaches from 60 futsal teams (5 main players, 4 reserves, and 1 coach for 
      each team). All of the players and the coaches were surveyed in a census method
      and no sampling was done. The data were analyzed by SPSS software, using
      chi-square, and Pearson correlation coefficient test. RESULTS: The results showed
      a positive significant relationship between the coaches' anxiety level and sport 
      competition anxiety level in the athletes (p = 0.019, r = 0.56). It also showed
      that there was a negative significant relationship between the coaches' anxiety
      level and performance level of the athletes (p = 0.012, r = -0.80). A negative
      significant relationship was also demonstrated between the athletes' competitive 
      anxiety level, and their athletic experiences (p < 0.001, r = -0.45) and age (p =
      0.001, r = -0.37). CONCLUSIONS: Coaches and officials should consider sport
      competition anxiety among athletes before and during competitions. Formal and
      planned competitions, training sessions, and preparation practices can be a major
      factor assisting to decrease athletes' anxiety. DECLARATION OF INTEREST: None.

TI  - Managing the health of the elite athlete: a new integrated performance health
      management and coaching model.
PG  - 523-31
LID - 10.1136/bjsports-2013-093222 [doi]
AB  - Elite athletes endeavour to train and compete even when ill or injured. Their
      motivation may be intrinsic or due to coach and team pressures. The sports
      medicine physician plays an important role to risk-manage the health of the
      competing athlete in partnership with the coach and other members of the support 
      team. The sports medicine physician needs to strike the right ethical and
      operational balance between health management and optimising performance. It is
      necessary to revisit the popular delivery model of sports medicine and science
      services to elite athletes based on the current reductionist multispecialist
      system lacking in practice an integrated approach and effective communication.
      Athlete and coach in isolation or with a member of the multidisciplinary support 
      team, often not qualified or experienced to do so, decide on the utilisation of
      services and how to apply the recommendations. We propose a new Integrated
      Performance Health Management and Coaching model based on the UK Athletics
      experience in preparation for the London Olympic and Paralympic Games. The
      Medical and Coaching Teams are managed by qualified and experienced individuals
      operating in synergy towards a common performance goal, accountable to a
      Performance Director and ultimately to the Board of Directors. We describe the
      systems, processes and implementation strategies to assist the athlete, coach and
      support teams to continuously monitor and manage athlete health and performance. 
      These systems facilitate a balanced approach to training and competing decisions,
      especially while the athlete is ill or injured. They take into account the best
      medical advice and athlete preference. This Integrated Performance Health
      Management and Coaching model underpinned the Track and Field Gold Medal
      performances at the London Olympic and Paralympic Games.

PG  - 389-401
AB  - Athletes' retention of information conveyed in coaches' feedback during training 
      was examined, considering the nature of the information transmitted by each coach
      (extensions, total number of ideas transmitted, and total number of repeated
      ideas), athletes' characteristics, (ages, genders, school levels, and practice
      levels), and athletes' perceptions (relevance and acceptance of coaches'
      information, task motivational levels, and athletes' attention levels).
      Participants were 193 athletes (79 boys, 114 girls; 9 to 13 years of age) and 6
      coaches. Feedback was both audio and video recorded and all athletes were
      interviewed. All coaches' feedback and athletes' recollections were subjected to 
      content analysis. Information was completely retained in 31.60% of feedback
      episodes. Athletes' mean per-episode information retention was 63.0%. Three
      variables appeared to b e predictiveathletes' retention: athletes' practice
      levels (p = -.25), attention to coaches' provision of feedback (P = .17), and the
      number of different ideas transmitted by each coach (P = -.90).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mental practice has been successfully applied in professional sports 
      for skills acquisition and performance enhancement. The goals of this review are 
      to describe the literature on mental practice within sport psychology and surgery
      and to explore how the specific principles of mental practice can be applied to
      the improvement of surgical performance-both in novice and expert surgeons.
      METHOD: The authors reviewed the sports psychology, education, and surgery
      literatures through Medline, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase. RESULTS: In sports,
      mental practice is a valuable tool for optimizing existing motor skill sets once 
      core competencies have been mastered. These techniques have been shown to be more
      advantageous when used by elite athletes. Within surgery, mental practice studies
      have focused on skill acquisition among novices with little study of how expert
      surgeons use it to optimize surgical preparation. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that
      performance optimization and skills acquisition should be viewed as 2 separate
      domains of mental practice. Further understanding of this phenomenon has
      implications for changing how we teach and train not only novice surgeons but
      also how experienced surgeons continue to maintain their skills, acquire new
      ones, and excel in surgery.

TI  - Differences in adolescent relationship abuse perpetration and gender-inequitable 
      attitudes by sport among male high school athletes.

AB  - PURPOSE: School-based athletic programs remain an important context for violence 
      prevention efforts although a better understanding of how gender attitudes and
      abuse perpetration differ among athletes is needed. METHODS: We analyzed baseline
      survey data from the "Coaching Boys into Men" study-a school-based
      cluster-randomized trial in 16 high schools in Northern California. We describe
      relationships among gender-inequitable attitudes, sport type, and recent
      adolescent relationship abuse perpetration among a sample of male athletes (n =
      1,648). RESULTS: Gender-inequitable attitudes (adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 3.26;
      95% confidence interval (CI), 2.56, 4.15), participation in both high school
      football and basketball (AOR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.37, 3.18), and participation in
      football only (AOR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.02, 2.22) emerged as independently associated
      with recent ARA perpetration. CONCLUSIONS: Findings warrant targeted violence
      prevention efforts among male high school athletes that incorporate discussions
      of gender attitudes and healthy relationships, especially among sports teams at
      greater risk of adolescent relationship abuse perpetration.

TI  - The effect of coach education on reporting of concussions among high school
      athletes after passage of a concussion law.
PG  - 1197-203
LID - 10.1177/0363546514521774 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasing attention has been paid to concussions and especially
      sports-related concussions in youth. To prevent an inappropriate return to play
      while symptomatic, nearly all states have now passed legislation on youth
      sports-related concussions. PURPOSE: To determine (1) the incidence of
      sports-related concussions in high school athletes using a unique system to
      collect reports on concussions, (2) the proportion of athletes with concussions
      who play with concussive symptoms, and (3) the effect of the type and modality of
      coach education on the likelihood of athletes reporting symptoms to the coach or 
      playing with concussive symptoms. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 
      2. METHODS: This study was conducted with high school football and girls' soccer 
      athletes playing in fall 2012 and their coaches and parents in 20 urban or rural 
      high schools in Washington State. The main outcome was the incidence of
      concussions per 1000 athlete-exposures (AEs), the proportion of concussed
      athletes who played with concussive symptoms, and the association of coach
      concussion education with coach awareness of athletes with concussive symptoms.
      RESULTS: Among the 778 athletes, the rate of concussions was 3.6 per 1000 AEs and
      was identical for the 2 sports studied. The cumulative concussion incidence over 
      the course of the season was similar in girls' soccer (11.1%) and football
      (10.4%). Sixty-nine percent of concussed athletes reported playing with symptoms,
      and 40% reported that their coach was not aware of their concussion. Most
      measures of coach concussion education were not associated with coach awareness
      of concussions in their athletes, although the modalities of a video and quiz
      were associated with a lower likelihood of coach awareness. CONCLUSION: More
      objective and accurate methods are needed to identify concussions. Changes in
      athlete attitudes on reporting concussive symptoms will likely not be
      accomplished through legislation alone.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The "Mayday Safety Procedure" (MSP) is included in the Australian
      Rugby Union (ARU) Medical and Safety Recommendations and the mandatory SmartRugby
      training for coaches. Previous research indicates that translating the Mayday
      Safety Procedure into practice among community rugby coaches is challenging. This
      study investigated whether Mayday Safety Procedure translation could be enhanced 
      by systematically planning and implementing a range of theory-informed and
      context-specific diffusion strategies. DESIGN: A controlled before-and-after
      study. METHODS: Coaches of senior community rugby teams in five zones in New
      South Wales (Australia) were invited to complete a questionnaire about their
      Mayday Safety Procedure knowledge and practice at the end of the 2010 and 2011
      rugby seasons. During 2011, coaches in the intervention zone were exposed to a
      range of strategies to promote Mayday Safety Procedure diffusion which were
      planned by following Step 5 of the Intervention Mapping protocol. Coaches in the 
      other four zones were exposed to usual strategies to promote Mayday Safety
      Procedure diffusion. RESULTS: Using the RE-AIM evaluation framework,
      statistically significant improvements were found among intervention zone coaches
      in: knowledge of most Mayday Safety Procedure key criteria; the number of coaches
      recognising their zone policy requiring them to train players in the Mayday
      Safety Procedure; frequency of provision of Mayday Safety Procedure training to
      players; coach perceptions of the quality of Mayday Safety Procedure training for
      players; and in confidence that referees could implement the Mayday Safety
      Procedure during a game if required. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the
      translation of injury prevention policy into community practice can be enhanced
      by developing and implementing a theory-informed, context-specific diffusion
      plan, undertaken in partnership with key stakeholders.

TI  - The Athlete's Perception of Coaches' Behavior Towards Competitors with a
      Different Sports Level.
PG  - 231-42
LID - 10.2478/hukin-2013-0086 [doi]
AB  - The study was designed to examine how active and former athletes across a
      different sports level perceived coaching behavior. Eighty competitive athletes
      (44 males and 36 females; 21.89 +/- 1.48 years of age; 8.35 +/- 3.65 years of
      competitive experience) from the University School of Physical Education in
      Cracow, Poland, participated in the study. They represented both individual (n = 
      50) and team sports (n = 30). Seventeen participants were internationally
      renowned and 63 were recognized for competitive excellence at a national level.
      The participants responded to a demographic survey and the Coaches' Behaviors
      Survey. The qualitative analysis procedures were employed to extract themes from 
      open-ended questions. It was confirmed that coaches who perceived their athletes 
      as more skilled, also treated them differently. Female athletes as compared with 
      male athletes, more frequently pointed at the leniency in coach's behavior
      towards highly skilled athletes, and perceived it as a factor inhibiting athletic
      development. Additionally, women often found individualization of the training
      process as a behavior reinforcing development. Less accomplished athletes more
      often pointed out to "a post-training session interest in the athlete" as
      directed only towards more accomplished counterparts; however, they indicated
      "leniency and favoring" less often than the athletes with international
      achievements. They also listed "excessive criticism" as a type of behavior
      hindering development, but they indicated coaches' "authoritarianism and
      distance" less frequently than the more accomplished counterparts. The study
      added data to the discussion of the Pygmalion effect and the phenomenon of the
      self-fulfilling prophecy both in general (Rosenthal and Jacobson, 1968; Harris
      and Rosenthal, 1985; Jussim, 1989) and sport psychology (Harris and Rosenthal,
      1985; Horn et al., 1998; Solomon and Kosmitzki, 1996; Solomon et al., 1998;
      Solomon, 2001).

TI  - Implementation of concussion legislation and extent of concussion education for
      athletes, parents, and coaches in Washington State.
PG  - 1190-6
LID - 10.1177/0363546513519073 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most states in the United States have passed laws regarding
      concussions, but little is known regarding the implementation of these laws.
      Hypothesis/ PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to survey high school coaches 
      3 years after the passage of a concussion law to evaluate the variation in
      concussion education and knowledge in the context of this law as well as measure 
      the effects of sport (football vs soccer) and urban versus rural locations. The
      hypothesis was that concussion education and knowledge would be more extensive in
      football compared with soccer and in urban locations compared with rural
      locations. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive epidemiology study. METHODS: A mixed-methods
      (paper and online) survey was conducted in 2012 to 2013 on a random sample of
      public high school football, girls' soccer, and boys' soccer coaches in
      Washington State, stratified by urban and rural locality. The survey covered the 
      extent of concussion education for coaches, athletes, and parents as well as
      coaches' concussion knowledge and experience. RESULTS: Of 496 coaches contacted, 
      270 responded (54.4%). Nearly all coaches answered concussion knowledge questions
      correctly, and nearly all coaches received education via >/=2 modalities
      (written, video, slide presentation, test, and in person). Athlete education was 
      less extensive, with 34.7% exposed to >/=2 modalities and 29.5% only signing a
      concussion information form. Parent education was even more limited, with 16.2%
      exposed to >/=2 modalities and 57.9% only signing a concussion information form. 
      Significantly more football than soccer coaches gave their athletes an in-person 
      talk about concussions (59.1% vs. 39.4%, respectively; P = .002) and provided
      concussion education to athletes via >/=2 modalities (44.1% vs. 29.7%,
      respectively; P = .02). Concussion education for coaches and parents was similar 
      between sports, and concussion education for all parties was similar in urban and
      rural localities. CONCLUSION: Three years after the passage of a concussion law
      in Washington State, high school football and soccer coaches are receiving
      substantial concussion education and have good concussion knowledge. Concussion
      education for athletes and parents is more limited. Football players receive more
      extensive concussion education than do soccer players. CLINICAL RELEVANCE:
      Clinicians should be aware that athletes and parents may not be receiving
      significant concussion education.

TI  - Toward a multidimensional model of athletes' commitment to coach-athlete
      relationships and interdependent sport teams: a substantive-methodological
      synergy.

LID - 10.1123/jsep.2013-0038 [doi]
AB  - Drawing from a three-factor model of organizational commitment, we sought to
      provide validity evidence for a multidimensional conceptualization designed to
      capture adolescent athletes' commitment to their coach-athlete relationship or
      their team. In Study 1, 335 individual-sport athletes (Mage = 17.32, SD = 1.38)
      completed instruments assessing affective, normative, and continuance commitment 
      to their relationship with their coach, and in Study 2, contextually modified
      instruments were administered to assess interdependent-sport athletes' (N = 286, 
      Mage = 16.31, SD = 1.33) commitment to their team. Bayesian structural equation
      modeling revealed support for a three-factor (in comparison with a single-factor)
      model, along with relations between commitment dimensions and relevant correlates
      (e.g., satisfaction, return intentions, cohesion) that were largely consistent
      with theory. Guided by recent advancements in Bayesian modeling, these studies
      provide a new commitment instrument with the potential for use and refinement in 
      team- and relationship-based settings and offer preliminary support for a
      conceptual framework that may help advance our understanding of the factors
      underpinning individuals' engagement in sport.

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess high school coaches' knowledge,
      attitudes, communication, and management decisions with respect to the Female
      Athlete Triad and to determine whether results are patterned by coach gender.
      Data were obtained through an online survey of high school coaches (n = 227).
      Significant differences were found between male and female coaches in certain
      attitudes and communication behaviors related to eating and menstrual
      irregularity. School or district level policies may help reduce these differences
      and may help mitigate the health consequences for athletes related to possible
      differential prevention and detection of the comorbidities of the Female Athlete 
      Triad.

TI  - The reliability of tests for sport-specific skill amongst elite youth rugby
      league players.
PG  - S471-7
LID - 10.1080/17461391.2012.714405 [doi]
AB  - In rugby league, tests of sport-specific skill often involve subjective
      assessments of performance by observers of varying qualification. However, the
      reliability of such subjective assessments has yet to be investigated via
      appropriate statistical techniques. Therefore, the aims of the current study were
      to investigate: (1) the intra-observer reliability of a non-qualified observer
      ('novice') and (2) the inter-observer reliability of the three observers (two
      qualified 'experts' and one novice observer) in the assessment of catching,
      passing and tackling (stages 1 and 2) ability in elite adolescent rugby league
      players (age: 14.7 +/- 0.5 years). Players performed each skill element within a 
      simulated practice drill and were assessed in 'real time' by the observers
      according to pre-defined criteria. An overall bias (P<0.05) was revealed between 
      the observers in stage 1 of catching and stage 1 of passing, the differences
      being higher for the novice compared to both expert coaches for each stage of
      catching and the first stage of passing, and between expert 2 and the novice for 
      stage 2 of tackling. No comparisons met the pre-determined analytical goal of
      'perfect agreement', for any of the skill components. Comparisons between the
      expert observers did not reach perfect agreement, with the lowest values
      occurring for both tackling skill stages (60-65%). None of the tests employed
      were sufficiently reliable to potentially discern between players of differing
      ability, which may mean up to 56% of players' skill being misinterpreted. The
      credibility of such assessments should be questioned and alternative tests
      considered.

AB  - The aim of this research is to understand the experience of the football sector
      on the use of artificial turf (satisfaction, safety, sporting feature, or the
      advantages and disadvantages). The study was conducted on a random selection of
      627 male participants (404 amateur/semi-professional footballers, 101 coaches and
      122 referees) that regularly train/compete on artificial turf in Spanish football
      leagues. The results of the skin abrasion, muscle strain and the possibility of
      sustaining an injury, on a Likert-type 10-point interval scale, gave a perception
      of 'somewhat dissatisfied' for the participants. The main advantages of
      artificial turf were their sports features, the evenness of the surface and the
      good state of conservation. Participants were satisfied with the artificial turf 
      surface. Approximately three out of four participants gave an overall ranking of 
      highly satisfied. The players were significantly less satisfied than the coaches 
      and referees. The overall satisfaction with artificial turf fields was strongly
      influenced by previous experience, particularly those who had previously played
      on dirt pitches. These results highlight the versatility of artificial turf to
      adapt to any circumstance or requirement for local sport and top-level
      professional competitions alike.

TI  - Basketball coaches' utilization of ankle injury prevention strategies.
PG  - 410-6
LID - 10.1177/1941738113491072 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ankle injuries are the most common high school basketball injury.
      Little is known regarding the utilization of ankle injury prevention strategies
      in high school settings. OBJECTIVE: To determine high school basketball coaches' 
      utilization of ankle injury prevention strategies, including prophylactic ankle
      bracing (PAB) or an ankle injury prevention exercise program (AIEPP). STUDY
      DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. METHODS: The survey was distributed to all high
      school basketball coaches in Wisconsin. Fisher exact and Wilcoxon rank sum tests 
      were used to determine if the injury prevention strategies utilized differed
      according to school size, sex of the team, years of coaching experience, and the 
      coach's education level. RESULTS: Four hundred eighty (55%) coaches from 299
      (74%) high schools completed the survey. Thirty-seven percent of the coaches
      encouraged or required their players to use PAB. School enrollment of the
      coaches' teams did not affect their stance on the use of PAB (P = 0.30), neither 
      did the sex of the team (P = 0.16), years coaching (P = 0.09), nor the coach's
      education (P = 0.49). Fifty percent (n = 242) of the coaches indicated they do
      not utilize an AIEPP, with no difference based on school enrollment (P = 0.47),
      team sex (P = 0.41), years coaching (P = 0.78), or the education level (P =
      0.44). Barriers to utilization of AIEPP included a lack of time, awareness, and
      expertise. Coaches preferred an AIEPP that was specific to basketball, combined
      injury prevention and performance enhancement components, was performed 2 to 3
      days per week, and lasted 5 to 15 minutes. CONCLUSION: Less than half of the
      coaches encouraged use of PAB, and half did not utilize an AIEPP. Coaches had
      specific preferences for the type of AIEPP they would implement. CLINICAL
      RELEVANCE: Sports medicine providers should promote ankle injury prevention
      strategies but need to address why prevention strategies may not be utilized in
      high school basketball settings.

TI  - Concussion Management, Education, and Return-to-Play Policies in High Schools: A 
      Survey of Athletic Directors, Athletic Trainers, and Coaches.
PG  - 258-62
LID - 10.1177/1941738113476850 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Concussions represent 8.9% to 13.2% of all high school athletic
      injuries. How these injuries are managed is currently unknown. HYPOTHESIS: There 
      are differences in concussion management and awareness among boys football, boys 
      ice hockey, and boys and girls soccer. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive epidemiologic
      study. METHODS: High school athletic directors were contacted via e-mail and
      asked to complete, and request that their staff complete, an online survey with 4
      sections aimed at athletic directors, head coaches, team physicians, and
      certified athletic trainers. RESULTS: According to coaches, concussion awareness 
      education was provided for football (97%), hockey (65%), and boys and girls
      soccer (57% and 47%, respectively) (P < 0.01). Use of sideline screening tools
      was significantly greater for football (P = 0.03). All participants agreed that a
      player who has suffered a concussion cannot return to play the same day.
      CONCLUSION: There is a difference in concussion management and awareness among
      the 4 sports. Concussion education is well promoted in football but should be
      expanded in soccer and hockey. Players are not allowed to return to play the same
      day, and the majority are referred to a physician. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Study
      results highlight the differences in concussion education among sports. Health
      care providers should address these gaps.

AB  - The goal was to assess the relation between the acceptance of using gamesmanship 
      and cheating in sports and the type of motivational climate created by coaches
      and parents. The sample consisted of 110 soccer, basketball, and handball players
      from the Balearic Islands competition (70 boys, 40 girls; M age = 14.7 yr., SD = 
      2.1, range 10-19). As for the motivational climate generated by coaches, task
      climate was negatively related to the acceptance of gamesmanship and cheating,
      but ego climate was related to higher acceptance. Motivational climate generated 
      by parents was not related to acceptance of cheating or gamesmanship.

TI  - Sports Nutrition and Doping Factors in Synchronized Swimming: Parallel Analysis
      among Athletes and Coaches.
PG  - 753-60
AB  - Although nutrition and doping are important factors in sports, neither is often
      investigated in synchronized swimming (Synchro).This study aimed to define and
      compare Synchro athletes and their coaches on their knowledge of sports nutrition
      (KSN)and knowledge of doping (KD); and to study factors related to KSN and KD in 
      each of these groups. Additionally, the KSNand KD questionnaires were evaluated
      for their reliability and validity. Altogether, 82 athletes (17.2 +/- 1.92 years 
      of age) and 28 coaches (30.8 +/- 5.26 years of age) from Croatia and Serbia were 
      included in the study, with a 99% response rate. The testand retest correlations 
      were 0.94 and 0.90 for the KD and KSN,respectively. Subjects responded equally to
      91% queries of the KD and 89% queries of the KSN. Although most of the coache
      sare highly educated, they declared self-education as the primary source of
      information about doping and sport-nutrition. Coaches scored higher than their
      athletes on both questionnaires which defined appropriate discriminative validity
      of the questionnaires. Variables such as age, sports experience and formal
      education are positively correlated to KSN and KD scores among athletes. The
      athletes who scored better on the KD are less prone to doping behavior in the
      future. These data reinforce the need for systematic educational programs on
      doping and sports nutrition in synchronized swimming. Special attention should be
      placed on younger athletes. Key PointsAlthough most of the synchro coaches are
      highly educated, self-education is declared as the primary source of information 
      about doping and sportnutrition.The knowledge of doping and doping-health hazards
      are negatively related to potential doping behavior in the future among
      synchronized swimmersThe data reinforce the need for systematic educational
      programs on doping and sports nutrition in synchronized swimming.We advocate
      improving the knowledge of sports nutrition among older coaches and the knowledge
      of doping among younger coaches, while among athletes,younger swimmers should be 
      targeted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Peer relationships account for a significant motivational influence
      on sport participation among youth athletes with and without disabilities.
      OBJECTIVE: The primary purpose of this study was to determine if the quality of
      friendships, physical self-perceptions and general self-worth predicted close
      friendship, loneliness and social acceptance among 46 athletes with physical
      disabilities (males = 35, female = 11) between the ages of 12 and 21 (M age =
      15.37, SD = 2.45). Second, this study examined descriptive information on the
      quality of friendships inside and outside of an adapted sport setting, feelings
      of loneliness, social acceptance, close friendships, athletic competence,
      physical appearance, and self-worth among youth athletes with physical
      disabilities. METHODS: Participants completed the Sport Friendship Quality Scale 
      (SFQS), a Loneliness Rating Scale and the Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents
      (SPPA). RESULTS: Three regression analyses used positive and negative aspects of 
      non-sport friendship quality, positive aspects of sport friendship quality,
      physical appearance, athletic competence, and self-worth as predictors and
      accounted for 57%, 41%, and 31% of the variance in loneliness, close friendships,
      and social acceptance, respectively. Athletic competence and self-worth were the 
      most important predictors of loneliness and close friendships with significant (p
      < .10) beta weights. No single predictor had a significant beta weight in
      predicting social acceptance. Negative and positive elements of friendship
      quality were not important predictors. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the 
      importance of global psychological (i.e., self-worth) and sport specific
      psychological (i.e., athletic competence) constructs in predicting important
      social well-being indices (i.e., close friendships & loneliness).

AB  - In this study, we explored the multifaceted concept of perceived mental and
      physical effort in team sport contexts where athletes must invest individual and 
      shared efforts to reach a common goal. Semi-structured interviews were conducted 
      with a convenience sample of 15 Catalan professional coaches (3 women and 12 men,
      3 each from the following sports: volleyball, basketball, handball, soccer, and
      water polo) to gain their views of three perceived effort-related dimensions:
      physical, psychological, and tactical. From a theoretical thematic analysis, it
      was found that the perception of effort is closely related to how effort is
      distributed within the team. Moreover, coaches viewed physical effort in relation
      to the frequency and intensity of the players' involvement in the game. They
      identified psychological effort in situations where players pay attention to
      proper cues, and manage emotions under difficult circumstances. Tactical effort
      addressed the decision-making process of players and how they fulfilled their
      roles while taking into account the actions of their teammates and opponents.
      Based on these findings, a model of perceived distributed effort was developed,
      which delineates the elements that compose each of the aforementioned dimensions.
      Implications of perceived distributed effort in team coordination and shared
      mental models are discussed.

TI  - Assessment, management and knowledge of sport-related concussion: systematic
      review.
PG  - 449-71
LID - 10.1007/s40279-013-0134-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sport-related concussions are a subset of mild traumatic brain
      injuries and are a concern for many sporting activities worldwide. OBJECTIVE: To 
      review and update the literature in regard to the history, pathophysiology,
      recognition, assessment, management and knowledge of concussion. METHODS:
      Searches of electronic literature databases were performed to identify studies
      published up until April 2013. RESULTS: 292 publications focussing on concussion 
      met the inclusion criteria, and so they were quality rated and reviewed.
      CONCLUSION: Concussion is hard to recognize and diagnose. Initial sideline
      assessment via the Sports Concussion Assessment Tool 3 (SCAT3), Child-SCAT3 or
      King-Devick test should be undertaken to identify athletes with concussion as
      part of a continuum of assessment modalities and athlete management. Sports
      medicine practitioners should be cognisant of the definition, extent and nature
      of concussion, and should work with coaches, athletes and trainers to identify
      and manage concussions. The most common reason for variations in management of
      concussion is lack of awareness of-and confusion about-the many available
      published guidelines for concussion. Future research should focus on better
      systems and tools for recognition, assessment and management of concussion. Sport
      participants' knowledge of concussion should be evaluated more rigorously, with
      interventions for sports where there is little knowledge of recognition,
      assessment and appropriate management of concussion.

PG  - 151-60
LID - 10.2147/OAJSM.S33556 [doi]
AB  - Organized youth sports are highly popular for youth and their families, with
      approximately 45 million children and adolescent participants in the US. Seventy 
      five percent of American families with school-aged children have at least one
      child participating in organized sports. On the surface, it appears that US
      children are healthy and happy as they engage in this traditional pastime, and
      families report higher levels of satisfaction if their children participate.
      However, statistics demonstrate a childhood obesity epidemic, with one of three
      children now being overweight, with an increasingly sedentary lifestyle for most 
      children and teenagers. Increasing sports-related injuries, with 2.6 million
      emergency room visits a year for those aged 5-24 years, a 70%-80% attrition rate 
      by the time a child is 15 years of age, and programs overemphasizing winning are 
      problems encountered in youth sport. The challenges faced by adults who are
      involved in youth sports, from parents, to coaches, to sports medicine providers,
      are multiple, complex, and varied across ethnic cultures, gender, communities,
      and socioeconomic levels. It appears that an emphasis on fun while establishing a
      balance between physical fitness, psychologic well-being, and lifelong lessons
      for a healthy and active lifestyle are paramount for success.

TI  - Eating disorders, physical fitness and sport performance: a systematic review.
PG  - 5140-60
LID - 10.3390/nu5125140 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Eating disorders are health problems that are particularly prevalent 
      in adolescents and young adults. They are associated with considerable physical
      health and psychosocial morbidity, and increased risk of mortality. We set out to
      conduct a systematic review to determine their effect on physical fitness in the 
      general population and on sport performance in athletes. METHODS/DESIGN: A
      systematic review of the relevant peer-reviewed literature was performed. For
      inclusion, articles retrieved from PubMed had to be published in English between 
      1977 and 2013. Wherever possible, methods and reporting adhere to the guidelines 
      outlined in the PRISMA statement. Some additional studies were retrieved from
      among those cited in the reference lists of included studies and from
      non-electronic databases. Literature searches, study selection, method and
      quality appraisal were performed independently by two authors, and data was
      synthesized using a narrative approach. RESULTS: Of the 1183 articles retrieved, 
      twenty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria and were consequently analysed.
      The available data indicate that eating disorders have a negative effect on
      physical fitness and sport performance by causing low energy availability,
      excessive loss of fat and lean mass, dehydration, and electrolyte disturbance.
      DISCUSSION: Although the paucity of the available data mean that findings to date
      should be interpreted with caution, the information collated in this review has
      several practical implications. First, eating disorders have a negative effect on
      both physical fitness and sport performance. Second athletics coaches should be
      targeted for education about the risk factors of eating disorders, as
      deterioration in sport performance in athletes, particularly if they are
      underweight or show other signs of an eating disorder, may indicate the need for 
      medical intervention. However, future studies are needed, especially to assess
      the direct effect of eating disorders on sport performance.

TI  - The role of sports physiotherapy at the London 2012 Olympic Games.
PG  - 63-70
LID - 10.1136/bjsports-2013-093169 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a lack of information on the utilisation of physiotherapy
      services at the Olympic Games. AIM: To better understand the athlete and
      non-athlete requirements of the physiotherapy services at the Olympic Village
      Polyclinic during the London 2012 Olympic Games. METHODS: From 16 July to 14
      August 2012, physiotherapy encounters for athletes and non-athletes (National
      Olympic Committee (NOC) team officials, coaches, team managers, workforce,
      Olympic family, technical officials and press) were recorded on the ATOS
      electronic medical records system at the polyclinic in the main Athletes' Village
      in Stratford. RESULTS: Of the 1778 encounters, 1219 (69%) were administered to
      athletes and 559 (31%) to non-athletes. The anatomical areas most frequently
      recorded at the first visits for athletes were knee (15.4%), lumbar spine/lower
      back (15.2%) and upper leg (12.6%) and that for non-athletes were lumbar
      spine/lower back (19.8%), knee (15.8%) and neck/cervical spine. Muscle (33.3%)
      and joint injuries (24.8%) were the most common diagnoses in athletes and
      non-athletes (24.4% and 30.1%). The five most frequently used treatment
      modalities were therapeutic soft tissue techniques (23.3%), mobilisation
      techniques (21.8%), taping (8.9%), cryotherapy (6.9%) and exercise prescription
      (6.4%). The most common cause of athletes' injuries was overuse (43.6%).
      CONCLUSIONS: This study of the London 2012 Olympic Games workload highlights the 
      physiotherapy needs of athletes as well as non-athletes and identifies the high
      numbers of pre-existing and overuse injuries in this setting, providing an
      insight into the reasons why the athletes seek physiotherapy support during the
      Olympic Games.

TI  - Sport-related concussion: "how many is too many?".
PG  - 425-31
LID - 10.1007/s12975-012-0237-y [doi]
AB  - The long-term effects of multiple sport-related concussions are currently at the 
      center of debate in the popular press and scientific community. The question,
      "How many concussions are too many," is frequently asked in the competitive sport
      environment by parents, athletes, and coaches. While research suggests that a
      history of concussion influences the risk and recovery from subsequent
      concussion, studies investigating the long-term effects of multiple concussions
      are less conclusive. This paper reviews the literature on multiple concussions
      and the potential long-term consequences of these injuries. Furthermore, this
      paper addresses how concussion history can inform clinical and return-to-play
      decisions. Recent studies incorporating novel brain imaging and
      electrophysiological technology for assessing residual impairment from multiple
      concussions are reviewed and the clinical implications of this work are
      discussed.

TI  - A systematic review of the psychological and social benefits of participation in 
      sport for adults: informing development of a conceptual model of health through
      sport.
PG  - 135
LID - 10.1186/1479-5868-10-135 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The definition of health incorporates the physical, social and mental
      domains, however the Physical Activity (PA) guidelines do not address social
      health. Furthermore, there is insufficient evidence about the levels or types of 
      PA associated specifically with psychological health. This paper first presents
      the results of a systematic review of the psychological and social health
      benefits of participation in sport by adults. Secondly, the information arising
      from the systematic review has been used to develop a conceptual model of Health 
      through Sport. METHODS: A systematic review of 14 electronic databases was
      conducted in June 2012, and studies published since 1990 were considered for
      inclusion. Studies that addressed mental and/or social health benefits from
      participation in sport were included. RESULTS: A total of 3668 publications were 
      initially identified, of which 11 met the selection criteria. There were many
      different psychological and social health benefits reported, with the most
      commonly being wellbeing and reduced distress and stress. Sport may be associated
      with improved psychosocial health in addition to improvements attributable to
      participation in PA. Specifically, club-based or team-based sport seems to be
      associated with improved health outcomes compared to individual activities, due
      to the social nature of the participation. Notwithstanding this, individuals who 
      prefer to participate in sport by themselves can still derive mental health
      benefits which can enhance the development of true-self-awareness and personal
      growth which is essential for social health. A conceptual model, Health through
      Sport, is proposed. The model depicts the relationship between psychological,
      psychosocial and social health domains, and their positive associations with
      sport participation, as reported in the literature. However, it is acknowledged
      that the capacity to determine the existence and direction of causal links
      between participation and health is limited by the cross-sectional nature of
      studies to date. CONCLUSION: It is recommended that participation in sport is
      advocated as a form of leisure-time PA for adults which can produce a range of
      health benefits. It is also recommended that the causal link between
      participation in sport and psycho-social health be further investigated and the
      conceptual model of Health through Sport tested.

TI  - Laughter in popular games and in sport. The other health of human play.
PG  - 127-50
AB  - Hurling in Cornwall, la soule in Britanny, Shrovetide football in England:
      Popular games have normally been treated as forerunners of modern sport, sport
      having regulated the space and the time of the game, the (non-) violence of
      behaviour, the control of results, the planning, strategy, tactics, techniques
      and evaluation of the competitive action. This is told as a story of social
      improvement and progress--and about turning unhealthy wildness into civilized
      'healthy' sport activity. What sociological analysis of game-playing tended to
      ignore was the laughter of the participants. With the seriousness of modern
      sport, as it was established in the nineteenth century, a culture of laughter
      disappeared. This study tries to counter this mainstream by a phenomenology of
      laughter in popular games. A contrasting attention is turned towards the
      seriousness of sporting competition, the smile in modern sport and fitness, and
      the 'underground' dimension of laughter in modern sports. By comparative
      analysis, laughter reveals as a bodily discourse about the imperfect human being.
      It tells an oppositional story about the perfectionism in the order of Western
      thinking--in sports as well as in health. The bodily 'physiology' of laughter,
      the exploding psychical energy, and the inter-bodily social relations in laughter
      and play and game point towards the multi-dimensionality of health, as it was
      formulated by WHO: as "physical, mental, and social well-being".

      performance: current knowledge and unresolved issues.

LID - 10.1136/bjsports-2013-093109 [doi]
AB  - Despite the limited research on the effects of altitude (or hypoxic) training
      interventions on team-sport performance, players from all around the world
      engaged in these sports are now using altitude training more than ever before. In
      March 2013, an Altitude Training and Team Sports conference was held in Doha,
      Qatar, to establish a forum of research and practical insights into this rapidly 
      growing field. A round-table meeting in which the panellists engaged in focused
      discussions concluded this conference. This has resulted in the present position 
      statement, designed to highlight some key issues raised during the debates and to
      integrate the ideas into a shared conceptual framework. The present signposting
      document has been developed for use by support teams (coaches, performance
      scientists, physicians, strength and conditioning staff) and other professionals 
      who have an interest in the practical application of altitude training for team
      sports. After more than four decades of research, there is still no consensus on 
      the optimal strategies to elicit the best results from altitude training in a
      team-sport population. However, there are some recommended strategies discussed
      in this position statement to adopt for improving the acclimatisation process
      when training/competing at altitude and for potentially enhancing sea-level
      performance. It is our hope that this information will be intriguing, balanced
      and, more importantly, stimulating to the point that it promotes constructive
      discussion and serves as a guide for future research aimed at advancing the
      bourgeoning body of knowledge in the area of altitude training for team sports.

      team-sport athletes.
PG  - i22-5

AB  - The internationalism of field-based team sports (TS) such as football and rugby
      requires teams to compete in tournaments held at low to moderate altitude (
      approximately 1200-2500 m). In TS, acceleration, speed and aerobic endurance are 
      physical characteristics associated with ball possession and, ultimately,
      scoring. While these qualities are affected by the development of neuromuscular
      fatigue at sea level, arterial hypoxaemia induced by exposure to altitude may
      further hinder the capacity to perform consecutive accelerations (CAC) or sprint 
      endurance and thereby change the outcome of a match. The higher the altitude, the
      more severe the hypoxaemia, and thus, the larger the expected decline in aerobic 
      endurance, CAC and match running performance. Therefore, it is critical for
      athletes and coaches to understand how arterial hypoxaemia affects aerobic
      endurance and CAC and the magnitude of decline they may face at altitude for
      optimal preparation and increased chances of success. This mini review summarises
      the effects of acute altitude/hypoxia exposure on aerobic endurance, CAC and
      activity profiles of TS athletes performing in the laboratory and during matches 
      at natural altitude, and analyses the latest findings about the consequences of
      arterial hypoxaemia on the relationship between peripheral perturbations, neural 
      adjustments and performance during repeated sprints or CAC. Finally, we briefly
      discuss how altitude training can potentially help athletes prepare for
      competition at altitude.

TI  - Tests examining skill outcomes in sport: a systematic review of measurement
      properties and feasibility.
PG  - 501-18
LID - 10.1007/s40279-013-0131-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A high level of participant skill is influential in determining the
      outcome of many sports. Thus, tests assessing skill outcomes in sport are
      commonly used by coaches and researchers to estimate an athlete's ability level, 
      to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions or for the purpose of talent
      identification. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic review was to examine
      the methodological quality, measurement properties and feasibility
      characteristics of sporting skill outcome tests reported in the peer-reviewed
      literature. DATA SOURCES: A search of both SPORTDiscus and MEDLINE databases was 
      undertaken. STUDY SELECTION: Studies that examined tests of sporting skill
      outcomes were reviewed. Only studies that investigated measurement properties of 
      the test (reliability or validity) were included. A total of 22 studies met the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: A customised
      checklist of assessment criteria, based on previous research, was utilised for
      the purpose of this review. RESULTS: A range of sports were the subject of the 22
      studies included in this review, with considerations relating to methodological
      quality being generally well addressed by authors. A range of methods and
      statistical procedures were used by researchers to determine the measurement
      properties of their skill outcome tests. The majority (95%) of the reviewed
      studies investigated test-retest reliability, and where relevant, inter and
      intra-rater reliability was also determined. Content validity was examined in 68%
      of the studies, with most tests investigating multiple skill domains relevant to 
      the sport. Only 18% of studies assessed all three reviewed forms of validity
      (content, construct and criterion), with just 14% investigating the predictive
      validity of the test. Test responsiveness was reported in only 9% of studies,
      whilst feasibility received varying levels of attention. LIMITATIONS: In
      organised sport, further tests may exist which have not been investigated in this
      review. This could be due to such tests firstly not being published in the
      peer-review literature and secondly, not having their measurement properties
      (i.e., reliability or validity) examined formally. CONCLUSIONS: Of the 22 studies
      included in this review, items relating to test methodological quality were, on
      the whole, well addressed. Test-retest reliability was determined in all but one 
      of the reviewed studies, whilst most studies investigated at least two aspects of
      validity (i.e., content, construct or criterion-related validity). Few studies
      examined predictive validity or responsiveness. While feasibility was addressed
      in over half of the studies, practicality and test limitations were rarely
      addressed. Consideration of study quality, measurement properties and feasibility
      components assessed in this review can assist future researchers when developing 
      or modifying tests of sporting skill outcomes.

TI  - Fit in 50 years: participation in high school sports best predicts one's physical
      activity after age 70.
PG  - 1100
LID - 10.1186/1471-2458-13-1100 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The health benefits of physical activity are widely established,
      including decreased risk for disease and improved mental well-being. Yet many
      children, adolescents, and adults do not meet the minimum recommendations
      specified in current public health guidelines and physical activity is known to
      decrease during the life course. The aim of this study was to identify background
      or personality characteristics that predict whether a healthy 25 year-old would
      become a physically active 75 year-old. This could have powerful implications for
      targeting physical activity and health interventions. METHOD: A unique data set
      was collected of 712 healthy United States males who passed a rigorous physical
      exam in the 1940s and who were surveyed 50 years later (in 2000). Their physical 
      activity level after 50 years was correlated and regressed across a wide number
      of demographic, behavioral, and personality variables from when they were 50
      years younger. Data was analyzed in 2012. RESULTS: In contrast to prior beliefs, 
      self-rated personality profile as a young man had little predictive influence on 
      later-life physical activity. Instead, the single strongest predictor of
      later-life physical activity was whether he played a varsity sport in high
      school, and this was also related to fewer self-reported visits to the doctor.
      CONCLUSION: Encouraging systematic or frequent physical activity at a young age -
      whether through school sports or club opportunities - might be the best
      investment in long-term activeness. This is relevant at a time when funding for
      many sports programs is being eliminated and play time is being replaced with
      screen time.

TI  - Assessing physical activity during youth sport: the Observational System for
      Recording Activity in Children: Youth Sports.
PG  - 203-9
LID - 10.1123/pes.2013-0095 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the validity and interrater reliability
      of the Observational System for Recording Activity in Children: Youth Sports
      (OSRAC:YS). Children (N = 29) participating in a parks and recreation soccer
      program were observed during regularly scheduled practices. Physical activity
      (PA) intensity and contextual factors were recorded by momentary time-sampling
      procedures (10-second observe, 20-second record). Two observers simultaneously
      observed and recorded children's PA intensity, practice context, social context, 
      coach behavior, and coach proximity. Interrater reliability was based on
      agreement (Kappa) between the observer's coding for each category, and the
      Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for percent of time spent in MVPA.
      Validity was assessed by calculating the correlation between OSRAC:YS estimated
      and objectively measured MVPA. Kappa statistics for each category demonstrated
      substantial to almost perfect interobserver agreement (Kappa = 0.67-0.93). The
      ICC for percent time in MVPA was 0.76 (95% C.I. = 0.49-0.90). A significant
      correlation (r = .73) was observed for MVPA recorded by observation and MVPA
      measured via accelerometry. The results indicate the OSRAC:YS is a reliable and
      valid tool for measuring children's PA and contextual factors during a youth
      soccer practice.

TI  - Mental Training with Youth Sport Teams: Developmental Considerations & Best
      Practice Recommendations.
LID - 10.1080/21520704.2012.733910 [doi]
AB  - Working with youth athletes requires knowledge of the inherent variability in
      child and adolescent development that will impact the implementation of a mental 
      training program. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of
      developmental considerations that should be noted when doing mental training,
      particularly for athletes participating in sport at mid-childhood, early
      adolescence, and mid-adolescence. Gender differences at these stages of
      development are also highlighted. Additionally, we forward best practice
      recommendations and learning-activities that have been tailored for each
      developmental stage that can be used in the provision of a mental training
      program in a team setting.

TI  - Coach-initiated motivational climate and cohesion in youth sport.
PG  - 373-83
AB  - PURPOSE: The general purpose of the present study was to examine the link between
      cohesion and motivational climate in youth sport. The first specific objective
      was to determine if relationships demonstrated in previous research with adult
      basketball and handball participants would be replicated in a younger sample and 
      with a more heterogeneous set of sports. The second specific objective was to
      examine whether sources of athlete enjoyment moderate the relationships between
      motivational climate and cohesion. METHOD: Athletes (N = 997; 532 girls and 465
      boys; Mage = 15.26 +/- 1.20 years) completed measures pertaining to
      coach-initiated motivational climate, cohesion, and sources of enjoyment.
      RESULTS: Bivariate and canonical correlations revealed positive correlations
      between perceptions of a task-involving motivational climate and both task and
      social cohesion, while ego-involving motivational climate was negatively related.
      Cluster analyses suggested that individuals perceiving a low task-involving
      climate and high ego-involving climate perceived their teams as less cohesive.
      Finally, the degree to which participants derived enjoyment through
      other-referenced competency served as a moderator in the motivational
      climate-task cohesion relationship. Specifically, the relationship between task
      cohesion and motivational climate was more pronounced for those individuals who
      were less likely to derive enjoyment through other-referenced competency.
      CONCLUSIONS: Youth athletes' perceptions of coach-initiated motivational climate 
      are related to cohesion. This relationship is, however, moderated by the degree
      to which athletes derive enjoyment through other-referenced competency.
      Motivational climate is an important variable to consider within team-building
      protocols intent on developing cohesion.

TI  - Weekly sport practice and adolescent well-being.
PG  - 208-10
LID - 10.1136/archdischild-2013-303729 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sport practice is widely encouraged, both in guidelines and in
      clinical practice, because of its broad range of positive effects on health.
      However, very limited evidence directly supports this statement among adolescents
      and the sport duration that we should recommend remains unknown. We aimed to
      determine sport durations that were associated with poor well-being. METHODS: We 
      conducted a survey including 1245 adolescents (16-20 years) from the general
      Swiss population. Participants were recruited from various settings (sport
      centres, peers of sport practicing adolescents, websites) and asked to complete a
      web-based questionnaire. Weekly sport practice was categorised into four groups: 
      low (0-3.5 h), average ( approximately recommended 7 h (3.6-10.5)), high (
      approximately 14 h (10.6-17.5)) and very high (>17.5 h). We assessed well-being
      using the WHO-5 Well-Being Index. RESULTS: Compared with adolescents in the
      average group, those in the very high group had a higher risk of poor well-being 
      (OR 2.29 (95% CI 1.11 to 4.72)), as did those in the low group (OR 2.33 (1.58 to 
      3.44)). In contrast, those in the high group had a lower risk of poor well-being 
      than those in the average group (OR 0.46 (0.23 to 0.93)). CONCLUSIONS: We found
      an inverted, U-shaped relationship between weekly sport practice duration and
      well-being among adolescents. The peak scores of well-being were around 14 h per 
      week of sport practice, corresponding to twice the recommended 7 h. Practicing
      higher sport durations was an independent risk factor of poor well-being.

PG  - 469-73
LID - 10.1016/j.jsams.2013.10.240 [doi]
LID - S1440-2440(13)00471-4 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Sporting bodies have developed guidelines for managing
      community-level players with suspected concussion in response to international
      consensus statements on concussion in sport. The purpose of this study was to
      examine the factors that influence the intended use of concussion guidelines
      among community-level coaches and sports trainers from two popular football codes
      in Australia: Australian football and rugby league. DESIGN: Cross-sectional
      survey. METHODS: The survey, based on an extended theory of planned behaviour
      model, was completed by 183 Australian football coaches, 121 Australian football 
      sports trainers, 171 rugby league coaches, and 142 rugby league sports trainers. 
      RESULTS: Personal norms and self-efficacy were significant predictors of
      intention to use concussion guidelines, although the relationship between
      self-efficacy and intention was stronger among Australian football coaches than
      rugby league coaches. Analysis of the salient beliefs that underpin self-efficacy
      found that coaches, irrespective of football code, felt less familiar
      (chi(2)=25.70, p<0.001) and less experienced (chi(2)=31.56, p<0.001) than sports 
      trainers in using the concussion guidelines. At the same time, Australian
      football personnel, irrespective of their team role, felt that they had
      insufficient time (chi(2)=8.04, p<0.01) and resources (chi(2)=12.31, p<0.001) to 
      implement the concussion guidelines relative to rugby league personnel.
      CONCLUSIONS: Programmes aimed at increasing the intended use of sport concussion 
      guidelines should focus on enhancing self-efficacy and leveraging personal norms.
      Increasing coaches' familiarity and experience in using the concussion guidelines
      would also be warranted, as would finding ways to overcome the perceived time and
      resource constraints identified among Australian football personnel.

AB  - Two studies explored the relationship between emotions, perceived mental effort
      and concentration disruption in adult sport performers. In Study 1,
      semi-professional association football players completed questionnaire measures
      before and after a competitive match. In Study 2, student athletes completed
      questionnaire measures for two performance scenarios: one in which they were
      performing above their normal level and one in which they were performing below
      their normal level. Findings demonstrated that cognitive trait anxiety was
      associated with greater disruptions in concentration but was unrelated to mental 
      effort. For state measures, athletes reported greater levels of concentration
      disruption when experiencing high levels of anxiety or high levels of happiness, 
      and fewer disruptions in concentration when experiencing high levels of
      excitement. Findings also showed that excitement was associated with low levels
      of mental effort during good performances and high levels of mental effort during
      poor performances; anxiety and happiness were associated with high levels of
      mental effort during good performances and low levels of mental effort during
      poor performances. Taken together, these studies point towards potential benefits
      accompanying high levels of excitement and potential disadvantages accompanying
      high levels of anxiety and happiness.

AB  - This article adds to the growing body of knowledge in sport pedagogy and focuses 
      specifically upon the intersection of gender and disability. Its purpose is
      twofold, to create a typology for examining good practice in sport pedagogy that 
      is reflective and inclusive and raises awareness of the diverse needs of all
      participants in physical activity 'regardless' of gender and ability for all
      children. We acknowledge that access to physical activity, education and sport
      are complex and multifaceted, however, the main purpose of this paper is to raise
      awareness of 'diversity' by focusing specifically upon the role of gender and
      ability. Through an examination of gender and disability policies in official
      European Union (EU) policy documents and commercial examples of
      policy-in-practice we propose a typology for diversity and diversity management. 
      A close look at EU level is instructive because national policies of the member
      countries vary a lot with respect to diversity issues but should be in accordance
      in the main areas. Such a reading enables the building of a typology of
      recommendations for how such policy can be rendered in sport pedagogy practice.
      We suggest six significant, but related principles that include (1)
      mainstreaming; (2) teaching and coaching sensitive to difference; (3)
      empowerment; (4) inclusion; (5) adaptation; and (6) inner differentiation. This
      holistic typology seeks to 'mainstream' issues of gender and disability policy by
      providing a set of principles that can be applied to a range of teaching and
      coaching settings.

LID - 10.1080/17461391.2013.775352 [doi]
AB  - Exemplary scientific methods describe concepts and provide theories for further
      testing. For the field of relative age effects (RAEs) in sport, the scientific
      method appears to be limited to description. The purpose of this paper is to
      provide a theoretical model to explain RAEs in sport, which researchers can use
      to test the effects, as well as to generate new hypotheses and recommendations.
      Herein, we argue that social agents have the largest influence on RAEs.
      Specifically, we propose that parents influence RAEs through Matthew effects,
      coaches influence RAEs through Pygmalion effects and athletes influence RAEs
      through Galatea effects. Integrating these three theories, we propose a model
      that explains RAEs through these various social agents. This paper provides a
      theoretical foundation from which researchers can further understand, explain and
      eventually use to create policies aimed at limiting the negative effect of
      relative age in sport.

AB  - The aim of this study was to identify the importance assigned by futsal coaches
      with different education levels to the sports performance factors (technical,
      tactical, physical and psychological) and to the training contents. The sample
      was divided into three groups (novice: n=35, intermediate: n=42; and elite
      coaches: n=15) depending on the degree of specific education, coaching experience
      and the level of the teams trained. To achieve this goal, the coaches answered a 
      questionnaire previously validated by specialists in sport sciences. The results 
      showed significant differences between the novice and elite group in small-sided 
      games, inferiority games, opposition and execution timing of the training and
      drill items. The analyses also showed significant differences between the novice 
      and intermediate group in inferiority games and opposition of the training and
      drill items. Although, no differences were identified between groups for the
      remaining performance factors and training and drill items considered, the
      identified trends provide a baseline related to the knowledge that contributes to
      the development of expertise of futsal coaches.

TI  - Comparison of athlete-coach perceptions of internal and external load markers for
      elite junior tennis training.
PG  - 751-6
LID - 10.1123/ijspp2013-0364 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the discrepancy between coach and athlete perceptions of 
      internal load and notational analysis of external load in elite junior tennis.
      METHODS: Fourteen elite junior tennis players and 6 international coaches were
      recruited. Ratings of perceived exertion (RPEs) were recorded for individual
      drills and whole sessions, along with a rating of mental exertion, coach rating
      of intended session exertion, and athlete heart rate (HR). Furthermore, total
      stroke count and unforced-error count were notated using video coding after each 
      session, alongside coach and athlete estimations of shots and errors made.
      Finally, regression analyses explained the variance in the criterion variables of
      athlete and coach RPE. RESULTS: Repeated-measures analyses of variance and
      interclass correlation coefficients revealed that coaches significantly (P < .01)
      underestimated athlete session RPE, with only moderate correlation (r = .59)
      demonstrated between coach and athlete. However, athlete drill RPE (P = .14; r = 
      .71) and mental exertion (P = .44; r = .68) were comparable and substantially
      correlated. No significant differences in estimated stroke count were evident
      between athlete and coach (P = .21), athlete notational analysis (P = .06), or
      coach notational analysis (P = .49). Coaches estimated significantly greater
      unforced errors than either athletes or notational analysis (P < .01). Regression
      analyses found that 54.5% of variance in coach RPE was explained by intended
      session exertion and coach drill RPE, while drill RPE and peak HR explained 45.3%
      of the variance in athlete session RPE. CONCLUSION: Coaches misinterpreted
      session RPE but not drill RPE, while inaccurately monitoring error counts.
      Improved understanding of external- and internal-load monitoring may help
      coach-athlete relationships in individual sports like tennis avoid maladaptive
      training.

BTI - Sports-Related Concussions in Youth: Improving the Science, Changing the Culture
AB  - In the past decade, few subjects at the intersection of medicine and sports have 
      generated as much public interest as sports-related concussions - especially
      among youth. Despite growing awareness of sports-related concussions and
      campaigns to educate athletes, coaches, physicians, and parents of young athletes
      about concussion recognition and management, confusion and controversy persist in
      many areas. Currently, diagnosis is based primarily on the symptoms reported by
      the individual rather than on objective diagnostic markers, and there is little
      empirical evidence for the optimal degree and duration of physical rest needed to
      promote recovery or the best timing and approach for returning to full physical
      activity. Sports-Related Concussions in Youth: Improving the Science, Changing
      the Culture reviews the science of sports-related concussions in youth from
      elementary school through young adulthood, as well as in military personnel and
      their dependents. This report recommends actions that can be taken by a range of 
      audiences - including research funding agencies, legislatures, state and school
      superintendents and athletic directors, military organizations, and equipment
      manufacturers, as well as youth who participate in sports and their parents - to 
      improve what is known about concussions and to reduce their occurrence.
      Sports-Related Concussions in Youth finds that while some studies provide useful 
      information, much remains unknown about the extent of concussions in youth; how
      to diagnose, manage, and prevent concussions; and the short- and long-term
      consequences of concussions as well as repetitive head impacts that do not result
      in concussion symptoms. The culture of sports negatively influences athletes'
      self-reporting of concussion symptoms and their adherence to return-to-play
      guidance. Athletes, their teammates, and, in some cases, coaches and parents may 
      not fully appreciate the health threats posed by concussions. Similarly, military
      recruits are immersed in a culture that includes devotion to duty and service
      before self, and the critical nature of concussions may often go unheeded.
      According to Sports-Related Concussions in Youth, if the youth sports community
      can adopt the belief that concussions are serious injuries and emphasize care for
      players with concussions until they are fully recovered, then the culture in
      which these athletes perform and compete will become much safer. Improving
      understanding of the extent, causes, effects, and prevention of sports-related
      concussions is vitally important for the health and well-being of youth athletes.
      The findings and recommendations in this report set a direction for research to
      reach this goal.

TI  - Sports-related concussion: Anonymous survey of a collegiate cohort.
PG  - 279-287
AB  - Studies suggest that a lack of standardized knowledge may lead to underreporting 
      and undertreatment of sports-related concussion. However, there has been little
      work done to establish how this knowledge may affect athletes' behaviors toward
      reporting their concussions and removing themselves from play. We conducted an
      anonymous online survey to assess athletes' knowledge of signs and symptoms of
      concussion, and also sought to estimate the potential frequency of underreporting
      in a collegiate athlete cohort. Among 262 athletes who responded to the survey,
      43% of those with a history of concussion reported that they had knowingly hidden
      symptoms of a concussion to stay in a game, and 22% of athletes overall indicated
      that they would be unlikely or very unlikely to report concussion symptoms to a
      coach or athletic trainer in the future. These data suggest that there may be a
      substantial degree of underreporting of concussion among collegiate athletes,
      despite most acknowledging that they have been formally educated about the risks 
      of concussion.

PG  - 475-9
LID - 10.1177/1941738112459327 [doi]
AB  - Ethical issues present a challenge for health care professionals working with
      athletes of sports teams. Health care professionals-including the team physician,
      the physical therapist, and the athletic trainer-are faced with the challenge of 
      returning an athlete to competition as quickly as possible but as safely as
      possible. Conflicts of interest arise due to conflicting obligations of the team 
      physician to the athlete and other members of the sports organization, including 
      coaches and the team owner. The multiple stakeholders involved in sports teams
      challenge the traditional notion of confidentiality and autonomy. The aims of
      this article are to explicate the ethics of sports medicine, highlight the
      ethical issues, and provide some strategies and suggestions for ethical decision 
      making.

TI  - Reliability, validity, and applicability of isolated and combined sport-specific 
      tests of conditioning capacities in top-level junior water polo athletes.
PG  - 1595-605
LID - 10.1519/JSC.0000000000000308 [doi]
AB  - Standard testing procedures are of limited applicability in water sports, such as
      water polo. The aim of this investigation was to construct and validate methods
      for determining water polo-specific conditioning capacities. We constructed 4
      combined-capacity tests that were designed to mimic real-game water polo
      performances: sprint swimming performance, shooting performance, jumping
      performance, and precision performance. In all cases, combined-capacity tests
      included a period of standardized exhaustion followed by the performance of the
      targeted quality (swimming, shooting, jumping, and precision). In the first part 
      of the study, single-capacity tests (sprint swim, in-water jump, drive shoot, and
      precision performance) were tested and later included in the combined-capacity
      tests. Study subjects consisted of 54 young male water polo players (15-18 years 
      of age, 185.6 +/- 6.7 cm, and 83.1 +/- 9.9 kg). Most of the tests evaluated were 
      found to be reliable with Cronbach alpha values ranging from 0.83 to 0.96 and
      coefficients of variation from 21 to 2% (for the single-capacity tests) and 0.75 
      to 0.93 test-retest correlation (intraclass correlation coefficients) with
      Bland-Altman tight limits of agreement (for combined-capacity tests). The
      combined-capacity tests discriminated qualitative groups of junior water polo
      players (national squad vs. team athletes) more effectively than single-capacity 
      tests. This is most likely because combined-capacity tests more closely represent
      the complex fitness capacities required in real game situations. Strength and
      conditioning practitioners and coaches working with water polo athletes should
      consider incorporating these validated tests into their assessment protocols.

TI  - Betting Patterns for Sports and Races: A Longitudinal Analysis of Online Wagering
      in Australia.
AB  - Online wagering is increasing in popularity as it is easily accessible through
      websites which market these services widely. However, few studies have examined
      online betting based on actual behavioural data. This paper describes the results
      of an analysis of 2,522,299 bets placed with an Australian online wagering
      operator over a 1-year period. The majority of bets placed were for a win (45.31 
      %) and were placed on races (86.74 %) or sports (11.29 %). Sports betting was
      dominated by ball sports, reflecting popular interest in these events. More than 
      three-quarters (77.63 %) of the bets were losses and there was large variation in
      bet size between bet types and events bet on although average bets were higher
      than in previously reported studies. The most popular bets placed to win, had a
      relatively high rate of losses and lowest average returns, which may reflect less
      sophisticated betting behaviour. More specific handicap and total bets were
      placed by fewer customers, but were larger bets with the greatest returns.
      Similarly, bets placed on less popular sporting events had greater average
      returns potentially reflecting greater customer sophistication and knowledge
      raising the possibility of a proportion of bettors being more 'skilled'. As the
      first paper to analyze the types of bets placed on events and outcomes the
      results support the notion that wagering is an entertainment activity, and the
      majority of customers are motivated by factors other than simply winning money.

TI  - Triangulation in Youth Sport: Healthy Partnerships among Parents, Coaches, and
      Practitioners.
PG  - 86-96
AB  - Youth sport is unique because it involves communication, coordination, and
      maintenance of relationships among multiple adults, all of whom are vested
      stakeholders in a child-athlete's sport experience. This dynamic becomes even
      more complex when a sport psychology practitioner is added; therefore, the
      purpose of this paper is to provide guidelines and considerations to assist sport
      psychology practitioners in managing the triangulation of adults who are involved
      in the consultation process with youth athletes. We first discuss specific dyads 
      and considerations for the practitioner and then highlight recommendations for
      practitioners regarding transparency and confidentiality issues specific to youth
      athletes.

TI  - Sport nutrition and doping in tennis: an analysis of athletes' attitudes and
      knowledge.
PG  - 290-7
AB  - Nutrition and doping issues are rarely studied in the sport of tennis. The aims
      of this investigation were to determine knowledge on doping (KD) and knowledge on
      sport nutrition (KSN), and corresponding socio-demographic-, sport-, and
      sport-nutrition- and doping-factors among an international sample of high-level
      tennis players of both sexes (43 females; 22 years old on average). In the first 
      phase of the investigation, the KSN and KD questionnaires were studied for their 
      reliability and validity. The consumption of NS is found to be very high, with
      almost of all the females and 80% of the males using NS at least occasionally.
      The athletes showed a low tendency regarding future doping usage, although most
      of them are convinced that doping does exist in tennis. Since athletes declared
      that their coaches are their main source of information about NS and doping,
      future studies should investigate what coaches actually know about such problems.
      KSN has been found to be protective against potential doping behavior in the
      future. Males are found to be more prone to doping than females. Therefore, in
      order to prevent doping behavior in tennis we strongly suggest intensive
      educational programs on sports nutrition and doping-related problems. Key
      PointsThe incidence of nutritional supplementation use among the tennis players
      is found to be very high, especially among the females.Although most of the
      subjects are of the opinion that the doping behavior is present in tennis
      circuit, we have found a low tendency regarding future doping usage, and high
      levels of athletes' trust in their coaches with regard to nutritional
      supplementation and doping.There are indices that the knowledge about nutrition
      is protective factor against potential doping behavior. It clearly reinforces the
      need to include a wide educational program on sports nutrition in tennis, but
      also in other sports.

TI  - Reliability and Validity of a New Test of Change-of-Direction Speed for
      Field-Based Sports: the Change-of-Direction and Acceleration Test (CODAT).
PG  - 88-96
AB  - Field sport coaches must use reliable and valid tests to assess
      change-of-direction speed in their athletes. Few tests feature linear sprinting
      with acute change- of-direction maneuvers. The Change-of-Direction and
      Acceleration Test (CODAT) was designed to assess field sport change-of-direction 
      speed, and includes a linear 5-meter (m) sprint, 45 degrees and 90 degrees cuts, 
      3- m sprints to the left and right, and a linear 10-m sprint. This study analyzed
      the reliability and validity of this test, through comparisons to 20-m sprint
      (0-5, 0-10, 0-20 m intervals) and Illinois agility run (IAR) performance.
      Eighteen Australian footballers (age = 23.83 +/- 7.04 yrs; height = 1.79 +/- 0.06
      m; mass = 85.36 +/- 13.21 kg) were recruited. Following familiarization, subjects
      completed the 20-m sprint, CODAT, and IAR in 2 sessions, 48 hours apart.
      Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) assessed relative reliability.
      Absolute reliability was analyzed through paired samples t-tests (p </= 0.05)
      determining between-session differences. Typical error (TE), coefficient of
      variation (CV), and differences between the TE and smallest worthwhile change
      (SWC), also assessed absolute reliability and test usefulness. For the validity
      analysis, Pearson's correlations (p </= 0.05) analyzed between-test
      relationships. Results showed no between-session differences for any test (p =
      0.19-0.86). CODAT time averaged ~6 s, and the ICC and CV equaled 0.84 and 3.0%,
      respectively. The homogeneous sample of Australian footballers meant that the
      CODAT's TE (0.19 s) exceeded the usual 0.2 x standard deviation (SD) SWC (0.10
      s). However, the CODAT is capable of detecting moderate performance changes (SWC 
      calculated as 0.5 x SD = 0.25 s). There was a near perfect correlation between
      the CODAT and IAR (r = 0.92), and very large correlations with the 20-m sprint (r
      = 0.75-0.76), suggesting that the CODAT was a valid change-of-direction speed
      test. Due to movement specificity, the CODAT has value for field sport
      assessment. Key pointsThe change-of-direction and acceleration test (CODAT) was
      designed specifically for field sport athletes from specific speed research, and 
      data derived from time-motion analyses of sports such as rugby union, soccer, and
      Australian football. The CODAT features a linear 5-meter (m) sprint, 45 degrees
      and 90 degrees cuts and 3-m sprints to the left and right, and a linear 10-m
      sprint.The CODAT was found to be a reliable change-of-direction speed assessment 
      when considering intra-class correlations between two testing sessions, and the
      coefficient of variation between trials. A homogeneous sample of Australian
      footballers resulted in absolute reliability limitations when considering
      differences between the typical error and smallest worthwhile change. However,
      the CODAT will detect moderate (0.5 times the test's standard deviation) changes 
      in performance.The CODAT correlated with the Illinois agility run, highlighting
      that it does assess change-of-direction speed. There were also significant
      relationships with short sprint performance (i.e. 0-5 m and 0-10 m),
      demonstrating that linear acceleration is assessed within the CODAT, without the 
      extended duration and therefore metabolic limitations of the IAR. Indeed, the
      average duration of the test (~6 seconds) is field sport-specific. Therefore, the
      CODAT could be used as an assessment of change-of-direction speed in field sport 
      athletes.

TI  - Artificial intelligence in sports on the example of weight training.
PG  - 27-37
AB  - The overall goal of the present study was to illustrate the potential of
      artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in sports on the example of weight
      training. The research focused in particular on the implementation of pattern
      recognition methods for the evaluation of performed exercises on training
      machines. The data acquisition was carried out using way and cable force sensors 
      attached to various weight machines, thereby enabling the measurement of
      essential displacement and force determinants during training. On the basis of
      the gathered data, it was consequently possible to deduce other significant
      characteristics like time periods or movement velocities. These parameters were
      applied for the development of intelligent methods adapted from conventional
      machine learning concepts, allowing an automatic assessment of the exercise
      technique and providing individuals with appropriate feedback. In practice, the
      implementation of such techniques could be crucial for the investigation of the
      quality of the execution, the assistance of athletes but also coaches, the
      training optimization and for prevention purposes. For the current study, the
      data was based on measurements from 15 rather inexperienced participants,
      performing 3-5 sets of 10-12 repetitions on a leg press machine. The initially
      preprocessed data was used for the extraction of significant features, on which
      supervised modeling methods were applied. Professional trainers were involved in 
      the assessment and classification processes by analyzing the video recorded
      executions. The so far obtained modeling results showed good performance and
      prediction outcomes, indicating the feasibility and potency of AI techniques in
      assessing performances on weight training equipment automatically and providing
      sportsmen with prompt advice. Key pointsArtificial intelligence is a promising
      field for sport-related analysis.Implementations integrating pattern recognition 
      techniques enable the automatic evaluation of data measurements.Artificial neural
      networks applied for the analysis of weight training data show good performance
      and high classification rates.

AB  - The main goal of the present study was to identify basketball game performance
      indicators which best determine sports level in the National Basketball
      Association (NBA) league. The research material consisted of all NBA game
      statistics at the turn of eight seasons (2003-11) and included 52 performance
      variables. Through detailed analysis the variables with high influence on game
      effectiveness were selected for final procedures. It has been proven that a
      limited number of factors, mostly offensive, determines sports performance in the
      NBA. The most critical indicators are: Win%, Offensive EFF, 3rd Quarter PPG, Win%
      CG, Avg Fauls and Avg Steals. In practical applications these results connected
      with top teams and elite players may help coaches to design better training
      programs.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the level of knowledge that current
      and preservice high school (HS) physical educators and sport coaches possess
      regarding the principles and methods involved in youth resistance training (RT)
      and to determine if that knowledge was acceptable based on a predetermined
      criterion (passing score). A panel of 10 experts in RT or sport pedagogy used a
      Delphi technique to create a 90-question assessment (examination) that was
      administered to 287 HS physical educators and sport coaches and 140 university
      physical education teacher education (PETE) students. An analysis of the results 
      revealed that neither group demonstrated the minimal knowledge necessary to
      design, implement, and supervise RT programs based on a passing score of 75%: HS 
      physical educators/coaches, mean = 59.30, SD = 14.30, 95% confidence interval
      (CI) = 57.64-60.96], t(286) = -18.61, p = 0.000; university PETE students, mean =
      56.61, SD = 16.59, 95% CI = 53.84-59.38, t(139) = -13.12, p = 0.000. The pass
      rate for physical educators and sport coaches was 14.3% and for university PETE
      students it was 20.7%. The results of this study indicate that both current and
      preservice physical educators and sport coaches need additional education and
      training specific to the design and implementation of RT programs for HS
      students. Given that school districts typically require their educators attend
      in-service training programs, it may be advisable to develop an in-service
      program that allows both current and preservice HS physical educators and sport
      coaches to earn an RT certification that specifically addresses the unique
      physical and psychosocial needs of school-aged youth.

      can have important implications for the development of an elite athlete's
      performance. It is argued that, from a schema-theoretic perspective, the
      difference in these interpretations needs to be better understood. A
      post-performance, self-confrontation, interview was conducted with a number of
      athletes and their coaches. The interviews revealed differences between the
      athlete and their coach in the information they are aware of. In comparison with 
      athletes, coaches more frequently compared the phenotype with genotype schemata
      rather than just describing the phenotype schemata. Results suggest SA
      information elements showed some common ground but also revealed some important
      differences between the athlete and coach. The awareness was directed externally 
      towards the environment and internally, towards the individual, depending on
      his/her role. The investigation showed that the schemata used to 'frame' the
      information elements were different, but compatible, between athlete and coach.

TI  - Predicting performance and performance satisfaction: mindfulness and beliefs
      about the ability to deal with social barriers in sport.

LID - 10.1080/10615806.2013.839989 [doi]
AB  - This research investigates the role of beliefs about the ability to deal with
      specific social barriers and its relationships to mindfulness, football
      performance, and satisfaction with one's own and team performance. Study 1 aimed 
      at eliciting these social barriers. Study 2 tested (i) whether self-efficacy
      referring to social barriers would predict performance over and above
      task-related self-efficacy and collective efficacy and (ii) the mediating role of
      self-efficacy to overcome social barriers in the relationship between mindfulness
      and performance. Participants were football (soccer) players aged 16-21 years
      (Study 1: N=30; Study 2: N=101, longitudinal sample: n=88). Study 1 resulted in
      eliciting 82 social barriers referring to team, peer leadership, and coaches.
      Study 2 showed that task-related self-efficacy and collective efficacy explained 
      performance satisfaction at seven-month follow-up, whereas self-efficacy
      referring to social barriers explained shooting performance at seven-month
      follow-up. Indirect associations between mindfulness and performance were found
      with three types of self-efficacy referring to social barriers, operating as
      parallel mediators. Results provide evidence for the role of beliefs about the
      ability to cope with social barriers and show a complex interplay between
      different types of self-efficacy and collective efficacy in predicting team sport
      performance.

TI  - Sport specificity of mental disorders: the issue of sport psychiatry.
PG  - S205-10
LID - 10.1007/s00406-013-0458-4 [doi]
AB  - The prevalence of psychiatric conditions among elite athletes is still under
      debate. More and more evidence has accumulated that high-performance athletes are
      not protected from mental disorders as previously thought. The authors discuss
      the issue of the sport specificity of selected mental diseases in elite athletes.
      Specific aspects of eating disorders, exercise addiction, chronic traumatic
      encephalopathy and mood disorders in the context of overtraining syndrome are
      examined. In particular, the interrelationship between life and work
      characteristics unique to elite athletes and the development of mental disorders 
      are reviewed. Differences of clinical presentation and some therapeutic
      consequences are discussed. The authors suggest that the physical and mental
      strains endured by elite athletes might influence the onset and severity of their
      psychiatric disorder. Beside the existing research strategies dealing with the
      amount of exercise, its intensity and lack of recreation experienced by athletes,
      further research on psycho-social factors is needed to better understand the
      sport-specific aetiology of mental disorders in high-performance athletes.

LID - 10.1155/2013/738705 [doi]
AB  - Given the clear benefits of regular physical activity (such as reduced risks of
      cardiovascular disease and obesity, as well as other benefits including those
      related to mental health), exploration of the reasons that adolescent girls give 
      for not taking part in team sports may be particularly valuable for enhancing
      later rates of participation. We combined questionnaires (n = 60) and
      semistructured interviews (n = 6) to assess the barriers that prevent
      15-16-year-old girls from participating in extracurricular team games and what
      can be done to overcome these barriers and improve physical activity levels. Four
      barriers became prominent as to why girls in this sample do not participate:
      Internal Factors, Existing Stereotypes, Other Hobbies and Teachers. Methods to
      overcome these barriers were identified; changing teachers' attitudes and
      shifting the media's focus away from male sport. Following the successful summer 
      Olympics and Paralympics in the UK, and the resulting positive focus on some of
      the nation's female athletes, a shift in focus may be possible. However, this
      needs to be maintained to allow girls more opportunities, role models and
      motivation to participate in sport.

TI  - Health-related quality of life after TAPP repair for the sportsmen's groin.
PG  - 439-46
LID - 10.1007/s00464-013-3190-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sportsmen's groin (SG) is a clinical diagnosis of chronic, painful
      musculotendinous injury to the medial inguinal floor in the absence of a groin
      hernia. Long-term results for laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair, especially
      data on health-related quality of life (HRQOL), are scant and there are no
      available data whatsoever on HRQOL after SG. The main goal of this study was to
      compare postoperative QOL data in the long term after transabdominal
      preperitoneal hernioplasty (TAPP) in groin hernia and SG patients with QOL data
      of a normal population. METHODS: This study included all patients (n = 559) who
      underwent TAPP repair between 2000 and 2005. Forty seven patients (8.4 %) were
      operated on for SG. We sent out the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36)
      questionnaire for QOL evaluation. QOL data were compared with data from an age-
      and sex-matched normal population. RESULTS: Ultimately, 383 completed
      questionnaires were available for evaluation (69 % response rate). The mean
      follow-up time was 94 +/- 20 months. In the SG group there were statistically
      significant differences in three subscales of the SF-36 and the mental component 
      summary measure, showing better results for the SG group compared to the sex- and
      age-matched normal group data. There were no statistically significant
      differences between groin hernia patients and the sex- and age-matched normal
      population. CONCLUSION: TAPP repair for SG as well as groin hernia results in
      good HRQOL in the long term. Results for SG patients are comparable with QOL data
      of a normal population or even better.

TI  - Meeting needs of Muslim girls in school sport: case studies exploring cultural
      and religious diversity.
PG  - 567-74
LID - 10.1080/17461391.2012.757808 [doi]
AB  - This paper contains a sociocultural analysis of school sport experiences of
      Muslim girls in two countries with different gender policies in physical
      education (PE) classes: England and Denmark. In Denmark, PE lessons take place in
      co-educative classes, in England schools are more diverse, with predominantly
      co-educational but also single-sex and faith schools offering different learning 
      contexts. Two case studies from Denmark and England are used to explore the
      experiences of migrant Muslim girls in these different settings. A social
      constructionist approach to gender underpins the interpretation of stakeholders' 
      voices on the inclusion of Muslim girls and the analysis of PE discourses in
      these countries. Findings illustrate similarities and differences at the
      interface of cultural diversity, political rhetoric of inclusion and realities of
      sport experiences for Muslim girls in both countries. Complex influences on PE
      experiences include gender stereotypes, cultural and religious orientations and
      practices, as well as actions and expectations of parents, communities and
      coaches/teachers. The studies provide insights into the ways participants managed
      their identities as Muslim girls in different sport environments to enable
      participation and retention of their cultural identities. Highlighted throughout 
      the paper are the ways in which school sport policy and practice, providers and
      gatekeepers, can include or exclude groups, in this case Muslim girls. Too often 
      coaches and teachers are unaware of crucial facts about their learners, not only 
      in terms of their physical development and capabilities but also in terms of
      their cultural needs. Mistakes in creating conducive learning environments leave 
      young people to negotiate a way to participate or refrain from participation.

TI  - Knowledge about sports-related concussion: is the message getting through to
      coaches and trainers?
PG  - 119-24
LID - 10.1136/bjsports-2013-092785 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The need for accurate diagnosis and appropriate return-to-play decisions
      following a concussion in sports has prompted the dissemination of guidelines to 
      assist managing this condition. This study aimed to assess whether key messages
      within these guidelines are reflected in the knowledge of coaches and sports
      trainers involved in community sport. METHODS: An online knowledge survey was
      widely promoted across Australia in May-August 2012 targeting community
      Australian Football (AF) and Rugby League (RL) coaches and sports trainers. 260
      AF coaches, 161 AF sports trainers, 267 RL coaches and 228 RL sports trainers
      completed the survey. Knowledge scores were constructed from Likert scales and
      compared across football codes and respondent groups. RESULTS: General concussion
      knowledge did not differ across codes but sports trainers had higher levels than 
      did coaches. There were no significant differences in either concussion symptoms 
      or concussion management knowledge across codes or team roles. Over 90% of
      respondents correctly identified five of the eight key signs or symptoms of
      concussion. Fewer than 50% recognised the increased risk of another concussion
      following an initial concussion. Most incorrectly believed or were uncertain that
      scans typically show damage to the brain after a concussion occurs. Fewer than
      25% recognised, and >40% were uncertain that younger players typically take
      longer to recover from concussion than adults. CONCLUSIONS: The key messages from
      published concussion management guidelines have not reached community sports
      coaches and sports trainers. This needs to be redressed to maximise the safety of
      all of those involved in community sport.

AB  - Coordination of dynamic interceptive movements is predicated on cyclical
      relations between an individual's actions and information sources from the
      performance environment. To identify dynamic informational constraints, which are
      interwoven with individual and task constraints, coaches' experiential knowledge 
      provides a complementary source to support empirical understanding of performance
      in sport. In this study, 15 expert coaches from 3 sports (track and field,
      gymnastics and cricket) participated in a semi-structured interview process to
      identify potential informational constraints which they perceived to regulate
      action during run-up performance. Expert coaches' experiential knowledge revealed
      multiple information sources which may constrain performance adaptations in such 
      locomotor pointing tasks. In addition to the locomotor pointing target, coaches' 
      knowledge highlighted two other key informational constraints: vertical reference
      points located near the locomotor pointing target and a check mark located prior 
      to the locomotor pointing target. This study highlights opportunities for
      broadening the understanding of perception and action coupling processes, and the
      identified information sources warrant further empirical investigation as
      potential constraints on athletic performance. Integration of experiential
      knowledge of expert coaches with theoretically driven empirical knowledge
      represents a promising avenue to drive future applied science research and
      pedagogical practice.

PG  - 101-9

AB  - The present study examines the relationship between individual differences in
      evaluative self-organisation and mental toughness in sport, proposing that
      motivation and emotional resiliency (facets of mental toughness) stem from
      differences in core self. A cross-sectional assessment of 105 athletes competing 
      at a range of performance levels took part in an online study including measures 
      of self-reported mental toughness (Sport Mental Toughness Questionnaire; Sheard, 
      M., Golby, J., & van Wersch, A. (2009). Progress towards construct validation of 
      the Sports Mental Toughness Questionnaire (SMTQ). European Journal of
      Psychological Assessment, 25(3), 186-193. doi:10.1027/1015-5759.25.3.186) and
      self-organisation (self-descriptive attribute task; Showers, C. J. (2002).
      Integration and compartmentalisation: A model of self-structure and self-change. 
      In D. Cervone & W. Mischel (Eds.), Advances in personality science (pp. 271-291).
      New York, NY: Guilford Press). As predicted, global mental toughness was
      associated with self-concept positivity, which was particularly high in
      individuals with positive-integrative self-organisation (individuals who
      distribute positive and negative self-attributes evenly across multiple selves). 
      Specifically, positive integration was associated with constancy (commitment to
      goal achievement despite obstacles and the potential for failure), which extends 
      presumably from positive integratives' emotional stability and drive to resolve
      negative self-beliefs.

TI  - A systematic review of the psychological and social benefits of participation in 
      sport for children and adolescents: informing development of a conceptual model
      of health through sport.
PG  - 98
LID - 10.1186/1479-5868-10-98 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are specific guidelines regarding the level of physical
      activity (PA) required to provide health benefits. However, the research
      underpinning these PA guidelines does not address the element of social health.
      Furthermore, there is insufficient evidence about the levels or types of PA
      associated specifically with psychological health. This paper first presents the 
      results of a systematic review of the psychological and social health benefits of
      participation in sport by children and adolescents. Secondly, the information
      arising from the systematic review has been used to develop a conceptual model.
      METHODS: A systematic review of 14 electronic databases was conducted in June
      2012, and studies published since 1990 were considered for inclusion. Studies
      that addressed mental and/or social health benefits from participation in sport
      were included. RESULTS: A total of 3668 publications were initially identified,
      of which 30 met the selection criteria. There were many different psychological
      and social health benefits reported, with the most commonly being improved
      self-esteem, social interaction followed by fewer depressive symptoms. Sport may 
      be associated with improved psychosocial health above and beyond improvements
      attributable to participation in PA. Specifically, team sport seems to be
      associated with improved health outcomes compared to individual activities, due
      to the social nature of the participation. A conceptual model, Health through
      Sport, is proposed. The model depicts the relationship between psychological,
      psychosocial and social health domains, and their positive associations with
      sport participation, as reported in the literature. However, it is acknowledged
      that the capacity to determine the existence and direction of causal links
      between participation and health is limited by the fact that the majority of
      studies identified (n=21) were cross-sectional. CONCLUSION: It is recommended
      that community sport participation is advocated as a form of leisure time PA for 
      children and adolescents, in an effort to not only improve physical health in
      relation to such matters as the obesity crisis, but also to enhance psychological
      and social health outcomes. It is also recommended that the causal link between
      participation in sport and psychosocial health be further investigated and the
      conceptual model of Health through Sport tested.

TI  - Do coaches orchestrate? The working practices of elite Portuguese coaches.
PG  - 263-72
AB  - PURPOSE: Although the concept of orchestration has resonated well with coaches
      and students of coaching, it remains quite an immature theorization lacking
      empirical evidence. Consequently, the purpose of this study was to explore the
      practice of expert Portuguese coaches from the perspective of orchestration. The 
      specific objectives related to examining if and how coaches manipulate contexts
      and relationships toward desired ends, if and how they steer and/or stage-manage 
      events, and precisely what informs their actions. METHODS: Data were gathered
      through a series of semi-structured interviews with 5 top-level Portuguese
      coaches from a variety of sports. The coaches were selected through purposive
      sampling. The interviews were taped and transcribed verbatim so that an accurate 
      record of the data gathered was obtained. The data were subject to both inductive
      and deductive examination through a process of thematic analysis. RESULTS: The
      categorical themes resulting from the process of data analysis included (a) the
      need amongst the coaches "for stakeholder buy-in," (b) "generating an illusion of
      empowerment" among both staff and athletes to ensure compliance, (c) "scaffolding
      the context to create a controlled instability" and (d) "detailed noticing to
      inform action." CONCLUSION: The coaches featured in this study were found to
      carefully and strategically consider their actions and behaviors; particularly
      concerning the generation of others' compliance and respect. Consequently, in
      giving further credence to the notions of power, social obligation, and the
      flexible scaffolding of learning, the findings support the notion that the
      concept of orchestration deserves further exploration and development in order to
      better understand the coach's role.

TI  - Differential analysis of the doping behaviour templates in three types of sports.
PG  - 211-7
AB  - Conducted researches recognize various risk factors, as well as protective
      factors against doping behaviour in different sports i.e. sports disciplines or
      activities. The main goal of this research was to identify the correlation
      between selected socio-demographic, health-related, and sports-related predictors
      with doping factors in three different types of sports, which are (1) highly
      energetic demanding sports (weightlifting), (2) highly technical demanding sports
      (racquet sports), and (3) highly tactical demanding sports (sailing). The
      research consisted of three separate studies, each one of them researching one of
      the sports. The sample of subjects included altogether 293 athletes, senior level
      competitors (older than 18years of age). In total, the sample comprised three
      homogenous sub-samples, as follows: athletes in highly energetic demanding sports
      (weightlifters and power lifters; N=27), athletes in highly technical demanding
      sports (table tennis, tennis and badminton players; N=188), and athletes in
      highly tactical demanding sports (sailing; N=78). The first study involved
      weightlifters where we should point out the existence of high doping behaviour In
      this study, religiousness was interpreted as the most significant protective
      factor against doping behaviour, while sports factors are not found to be
      significantly related to doping. The study involving racquet sport athletes
      suggests a high risk of doping behaviour among those athletes who observe doping 
      behaviour in their sport. We noticed low levels of athletes' trust in their
      coaches' and physicians' opinions on doping issues. This is an issue which should
      be researched in the future, because the underlying cause has not been studied as
      yet. Briefly, it seems that either the athletes are not convinced of their
      coaches '/physicians' expertise regarding doping issues, and/or they do not
      believe in their good intentions. It is particularly important, as the previous
      research has shown that with the increased trust in coaches and physicians, the
      chance that an athlete will use doping decreases. As expected, it is
      characteristic for sailing that it has a low likelihood of potential doping
      behaviour, although the consumption of dietary supplements is high. Substance
      abuse in sports spreads beyond those that enhance athletic performance. All of
      these issues should be studied in more detail in the future and, if appropriately
      validated, incorporated into anti-doping intervention programs.

TI  - Sport nutrition and doping factors in swimming; parallel analysis among athletes 
      and coaches.
PG  - 179-86
AB  - The sport nutrition and doping are known to be important issues in sports, but
      there is evident lack of studies which investigated those issues in swimming,
      especially with regard to parallel analysis of coaches and athletes. The first
      aim of this study was to compare knowledge of swimming coaches and their athletes
      about nutrition and doping. Also, we have identified interrelationships between
      studied sociodemographic-, sport-; nutrition- and doping-related-factors. The
      sample of subjects comprised 55 athletes (20.3 +/- 2.2 years of age; 24 females) 
      and 22 coaches (mean age 36.5 +/- 7.8 years; 4 females) from Croatia (98% of
      respondents). In the first phase of the investigation we have validated specific 
      questionnaires to determine the knowledge of sport nutrition (KSN), and knowledge
      on doping (KD). The test-retest correlation and percentage of equally responded
      queries revealed both questionnaires as reliable. The discriminative validity was
      proven also since coaches scored better than their athletes on both
      questionnaires. Athletes declared their coaches as the primary sources of
      knowledge about nutrition and doping. Among coaches, formal and self-education
      are equally important sources of information about doping and nutrition. The age 
      is negatively, while the formal education is positively correlated to KD and KSN 
      scores among coaches. Consequently, permanent educational programs about
      nutrition and doping are emphasized, especially among older coaches and younger
      athletes.

TI  - Development and validation of a pediatric sports activity rating scale: the
      Hospital for Special Surgery Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale (HSS
      Pedi-FABS).
PG  - 2421-9
LID - 10.1177/0363546513496548 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Having simple and reliable validated outcome measures is vital to
      conducting high-quality outcomes research in the field of orthopaedic surgery.
      Activity level is a key prognostic variable for patients with sports injuries.
      There is a paucity of such activity scales for children and adolescents who are
      otherwise healthy and athletically active. In addition to frequency and intensity
      of athletic activity, level of play and coach/trainer supervision are important
      variables unique to children and adolescents that are not captured in available
      adult scoring systems. PURPOSE: To create and validate a concise and
      comprehensive activity rating scale for athletically active children and
      adolescents 10 to 18 years of age. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study (diagnosis); Level 
      of evidence, 2. METHODS: Item generation was performed with a panel of
      orthopaedic surgeons and adolescent athletes. Item reduction, pilot testing and
      scale refinement resulted in a final 8-item instrument, the Hospital for Special 
      Surgery Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale (HSS Pedi-FABS). Existing
      methods were used to determine reliability and validation. The Flesch-Kincaid
      score was calculated at a 6.6th-grade reading level (approximately 13 years old);
      therefore, although all subjects provided their own answers, parents were allowed
      to assist children younger than 13 years with reading the questionnaire. RESULTS:
      Scale reliability was excellent (test-retest reliability, intraclass correlation 
      coefficient = 0.91; internal consistency, Cronbach alpha = .914), and there were 
      no floor or ceiling effects. There was also robust construct validity: Convergent
      validity testing revealed positive correlations between the HSS Pedi-FABS and
      level of competition in athletic activity, number of reported hours of athletic
      activity per week, and existing comparable adult and pediatric scales.
      Discriminant validity was shown with age, body mass index, and type of sport as
      measured by the Daniel scale. CONCLUSION: The 8-item HSS Pedi-FABS can be used to
      reliably and accurately evaluate activity level as a prognostic variable for
      clinical research studies. It is a simple, reliable, and valid metric to assess
      activity in children and adolescents 10 to 18 years of age. This instrument will 
      lead to better evaluation of posttreatment outcomes and patient-reported activity
      for child and adolescent athletes.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The female athlete triad (FAT) is a serious health-related problem 
      that threatens women who exercise. This condition is an interrelated
      multifactorial syndrome which includes low energy availability, menstrual cycle
      disturbances and decreased bone mineral density. OBJECTIVE: To review the major
      components of the FAT and their relationships, as well as strategies for
      diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: Articles related to the topic were reviewed
      through PubMed and SportDiscus databases. RESULTS: Interrelationship between
      components of the FAT may result in clinical manifestations, including eating
      disorders, amenorrhea and osteoporosis. Clinical conditions are not always
      exhibited simultaneously. Prevention is important to minimize complications.
      Diagnosis and treatment is complicated and often must involve an
      interdisciplinary therapeutic approach. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding of the disease
      may be facilitated by a unified framework focusing on energy deficiency.
      Preventive or early interventions require to increase energy availability through
      a higher total energy intake or a decrease in energy expenditure trough excessive
      physical exercise. A healthy lifestyle, and support by parents and coaches should
      be included. Psychotherapy may be necessary when eating disorders are present.

TI  - Ramadan and sport: minimizing effects upon the observant athlete.
PG  - 1217-41
LID - 10.1007/s40279-013-0080-7 [doi]
AB  - The intermittent fasting of Ramadan could affect various aspects of body
      physiology and biochemistry important to athletic success. Much of the available 
      information on this subject has been collected from sedentary subjects or
      low-level competitors, often without well matched controls. Other issues
      requiring clearer definition include the duration of fasting, the local
      environment, the timing of observations, and changes in training, diet and sleep 
      patterns. Sleep may be shortened or made good with daytime naps. Circadian
      rhythms of temperature, metabolism, hormonal secretions and physical performance 
      may be disrupted and incidental activities curtailed. Disturbances of psychomotor
      performance include daytime sleepiness, impaired vigilance and slower reactions. 
      Food intake is limited to night-time meals. Sedentary individuals sometimes
      exploit Ramadan to reduce body fat stores. Well disciplined athletes usually
      maintain energy balance unless daily energy expenditures are very high. Protein
      intake must allow for gluconeogenesis, and provide quality protein ingested
      around training times. Blood sugar levels are likely to fall over a long and
      active day, even if morning glycogen reserves are maximized. Metabolism of fat
      should be encouraged, beginning prior to Ramadan; inclusion of fat in the
      pre-dawn meal also slows gastric emptying. Daytime fluid depletion is inevitable 
      if athletes exercise in the heat, but the immediate deficit can usually be made
      good at night. Some studies show an initial fluid depletion, with recovery as
      Ramadan continues, possibly reflecting changes in urine and sweat production. Top
      athletes can maintain training throughout Ramadan, although coaches sometimes
      reduce demands through a pre-competitive tapering of effort. Late night or early 
      morning training requires negotiation with players who are not observing Ramadan,
      and dietary adjustments to maintain optimal plasma amino acid levels when
      training. Performance of repeated anaerobic exercise is impaired, but aerobic
      power and muscular strength show little change during Ramadan. Ratings of fatigue
      are increased, and vigilance and reaction times are impaired, particularly during
      the afternoon. Medical issues during Ramadan are few. Athletes with diabetes
      mellitus should seek a medical exemption from fasting, and prescribed drug
      schedules should be carefully maintained. There is no major increase of injury
      rates, but competitors may have difficulty in producing urine for doping
      controls. Logical measures to minimize the effects of Ramadan include the
      optimization of mood state, maintenance of training, minimization of sleep loss, 
      appropriate adjustments of diet, and the monitoring of competitors for chronic
      dehydration. Future research should concentrate on the changes observed in top
      athletes, particularly women, with data collected in the late afternoon after a
      known period of fasting in a well defined environment. It will be important to
      ensure that the lifestyle of those studied has been optimized. Implications of
      chronic dehydration for doping control also merit further investigation. Current 
      data suggest that the impact of Ramadan upon athletic performance is small
      relative to the precision of test procedures, although it may be sufficient to
      cause a loss of medals. Negative effects vary widely with the type of sport, the 
      season when fasting is observed, the local culture and the discipline exercised
      by the athlete.

TI  - Examining the structural relationships among gambling motivation, passion, and
      consequences of internet sports betting.
PG  - 845-58
LID - 10.1007/s10899-013-9400-y [doi]
AB  - The rise in popularity of Internet gambling has led to new gambling controversies
      among researchers and policymakers alike. Opponents frequently point to the
      negative impacts of problem gambling, while advocates tend to view this form of
      gambling as relatively harmless and convenient entertainment for the vast
      majority of participants. Interestingly, in making their points, both sides cite 
      empirical arguments about passion for the gambling act-with opponents arguing
      that Internet gambling enables unhealthy obsessions, and advocates pointing to
      the apparent intensive interest of large numbers of Internet players. As it turns
      out, both sides may have a point. In this paper, we examine whether types of
      passion were related to types of motivation and consequences. The data were
      collected through a sample from an online gambling website in South Korea. We
      rely upon Rousseau et al.'s (J Gambl Stud 18(1):45-66, 2002) seminal work on
      positive and negative aspects of passion, and in the process we develop a
      framework for understanding positive and negative consequences of this form of
      gambling. The results reveal that intrinsic gambling motivations (e.g., gambling 
      for excitement) is related to harmonious passion, which in turn results in
      positive consequences. Meanwhile, extrinsic gambling motivations (e.g., money) is
      related to obsessive passion, which in turn results in negative consequences.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a 12-week lifestyle program for
      changes in healthy lifestyle knowledge, health perceptions and body composition
      of middle-aged, overweight men. METHODS: A participatory, action-based
      experimental design was employed with a convenience sample (n = 24) of
      middle-aged men who were supporters of either a local rugby league or rugby union
      club. Participants attended an introductory session and baseline testing in week 
      one, participated in once-weekly group circuit exercise and lifestyle education
      sessions for 10 weeks and attended post-testing and project evaluation in week
      12. RESULTS: Fourteen participants completed the project. Healthy lifestyle
      knowledge did not improve significantly. As a combined group there were
      significant improvements in both physical and mental components of the SF12
      questionnaire and in waist girth. The rugby league cohort achieved significant
      improvement in the SF12 physical component, weight, BMI and waist girth. The
      rugby union cohort achieved significant improvement in the SF12 mental component 
      and waist girth. Participants reported a variety of health improvement and
      lifestyle changes following the project and reported appreciation at the
      involvement of the sporting club. CONCLUSIONS: The men's lifestyle program
      resulted in significant improvement in body composition, resulting in a reduction
      in obesity-related disease risk in some participants.

TI  - Shared knowledge or shared affordances? Insights from an ecological dynamics
      approach to team coordination in sports.
PG  - 765-72
LID - 10.1007/s40279-013-0070-9 [doi]
AB  - Previous research has proposed that team coordination is based on shared
      knowledge of the performance context, responsible for linking teammates' mental
      representations for collective, internalized action solutions. However, this
      representational approach raises many questions including: how do individual
      schemata of team members become reformulated together? How much time does it take
      for this collective cognitive process to occur? How do different cues perceived
      by different individuals sustain a general shared mental representation? This
      representational approach is challenged by an ecological dynamics perspective of 
      shared knowledge in team coordination. We argue that the traditional shared
      knowledge assumption is predicated on 'knowledge about' the environment, which
      can be used to share knowledge and influence intentions of others prior to
      competition. Rather, during competitive performance, the control of action by
      perceiving surrounding informational constraints is expressed in 'knowledge of'
      the environment. This crucial distinction emphasizes perception of shared
      affordances (for others and of others) as the main communication channel between 
      team members during team coordination tasks. From this perspective, the emergence
      of coordinated behaviours in sports teams is based on the formation of
      interpersonal synergies between players resulting from collective actions
      predicated on shared affordances.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Perpetration of physical, sexual, and psychological abuse is
      prevalent in adolescent relationships. One strategy for reducing such violence is
      to increase the likelihood that youth will intervene when they see peers engaging
      in disrespectful and abusive behaviors. PURPOSE: This 12-month follow-up of a
      cluster RCT examined the longer-term effectiveness of Coaching Boys Into Men, a
      dating violence prevention program targeting high school male athletes. DESIGN:
      This cluster RCT was conducted from 2009 to 2011. The unit of randomization was
      the school, and the unit of analysis was the athlete. Data were analyzed in 2012.
      SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Participants were male athletes in Grades 9-11 (N=1513)
      participating in athletics in 16 high schools. INTERVENTION: The intervention
      consisted of training athletic coaches to integrate violence prevention messages 
      into coaching activities through brief, weekly, scripted discussions with
      athletes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were intentions to intervene,
      recognition of abusive behaviors, and gender-equitable attitudes. Secondary
      outcomes included bystander behaviors and abuse perpetration. Intervention
      effects were expressed as adjusted mean between-arm differences in changes in
      outcomes over time, estimated via regression models for clustered, longitudinal
      data. RESULTS: Perpetration of dating violence in the past 3 months was less
      prevalent among intervention athletes relative to control athletes, resulting in 
      an estimated intervention effect of -0.15 (95% CI=-0.27, -0.03). Intervention
      athletes also reported lower levels of negative bystander behaviors (i.e.,
      laughing and going along with peers' abusive behaviors) compared to controls
      (-0.41, 95% CI=-0.72, -0.10). No differences were observed in intentions to
      intervene (0.04, 95% CI=-0.07, 0.16); gender-equitable attitudes (-0.04, 95%
      CI=-0.11, 0.04); recognition of abusive behaviors (-0.03, 95% CI=-0.15, 0.09); or
      positive bystander behaviors (0.04, 95% CI=-0.11, 0.19). CONCLUSIONS: This school
      athletics-based dating violence prevention program is a promising approach to
      reduce perpetration and negative bystander behaviors that condone dating violence
      among male athletes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is registered at
      www.clinicaltrials.gov NCTO1367704.

TI  - Using theory to understand high school aged athletes' intentions to report
      sport-related concussion: implications for concussion education initiatives.
PG  - 878-86
LID - 10.3109/02699052.2013.775508 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the influence of psychosocial determinants from the Theory
      of Reasoned Action and Planned Behaviour (TRA/TPB) on concussion-reporting
      intentions. METHODS: The present study employed the TRA/TPB to develop a
      cross-sectional survey to examine contributors to intention to report concussion 
      symptoms. High school athletes (n = 167, age = 15.7 +/- 1.4) completed this
      survey. The TRA/TPB constructs of attitude (perceptions about concussion
      reporting), subjective norm (perception of important social referents beliefs
      about concussion reporting), perceived behavioural control (perceived control
      over concussion reporting) and intention to report concussion symptoms served as 
      the independent variables. Linear regression models were used to predict
      intention to report concussion symptoms. Binomial regression models were used to 
      predict concussion-reporting behaviours from intention. RESULTS: Direct attitude,
      subjective norm and direct perceived behavioural control were all associated with
      intention to report concussion. Intention was associated with decreased
      prevalence of participating in practices and games while symptomatic from
      concussion. CONCLUSIONS: Favourable attitudes toward reporting and social
      referents' beliefs have the greatest impact on intention to report concussion
      symptoms. Reporting intention may not always be an indicator of
      concussion-reporting behaviours. Concussion education initiatives should focus on
      improving attitudes and beliefs among athletes, coaches and parents to promote
      better care-seeking behaviours among young athletes.

TI  - Coaching Competency and (Exploratory) Structural Equation Modeling: A
      Substantive-Methodological Synergy.
PG  - 709-718
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this manuscript was to provide a
      substantive-methodological synergy of potential importance to future research in 
      the psychology of sport and exercise. DESIGN: The substantive focus was the
      emerging role for, and particularly the measurement of, athletes' evaluations of 
      their coach's competency within conceptual models of effective coaching. The
      methodological focus was exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM), a
      methodology that integrates the advantages of exploratory factor analysis and
      confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) within the general structural equation model. 
      METHOD: The synergy was a demonstration of when a new and flexible methodological
      framework, ESEM, may be preferred as compared to a more familiar and restrictive 
      methodological framework, CFA, by reanalyzing existing data. RESULTS: ESEM
      analysis on extant datasets suggested that for responses to the Athletes'
      Perceptions of Coaching Competency Scale II - High School Teams (APCCS II-HST), a
      CFA model based on the relevant literature plus one post hoc modification,
      offered a viable alternative to a more complex ESEM model. For responses to the
      Coaching Competency Scale (CCS), a CFA model based on the relevant literature did
      not offer a viable alternative to a more complex ESEM model. CONCLUSIONS: The
      ESEM framework should be strongly considered in subsequent studies validity
      studies - for new and/or existing instruments in the psychology of sport and
      exercise. A key consideration for deciding between ESEM and the accompanying
      rotation criterion and CFA in future validity studies should be level of a priori
      measurement theory.

AB  - PURPOSE: To explore the psychosocial outcomes of an inclusive adapted sport and
      adventurous training course that aims to support the rehabilitation and personal 
      development of military personnel who have sustained physical and/or
      psychological disability. METHOD: Narrative life story interviews were conducted 
      with 11 men aged 20-43 taking part in one of the 5-day courses. A thematic
      narrative analysis was conducted, focusing on accounts that provided insights
      into personally meaningful psychosocial outcomes of the course. FINDINGS: We
      identified six themes, falling into two distinct clusters. "Bringing me back to
      myself" was achieved through the themes of (1) returning to activity, (2)
      rediscovering a sense of purpose, and (3) reconnecting to others. "New rooms to
      explore" was realised through (4) experiencing new activities, (5) being
      valued/respected/cared for and (6) being inspired by other people. CONCLUSION:
      Involvement in the course stimulated a balance of present- and future-oriented
      psychosocial outcomes through which participants both recreated aspects of
      themselves that had been lost through injury/trauma and moved forward with their 
      lives as a result of new horizons of possibility. IMPLICATIONS FOR
      REHABILITATION: This 5-day inclusive adapted sport and adventurous training
      course offered meaningful psychosocial outcomes among military personnel who had 
      experienced physical and/or psychological disability. The course helped
      participants recover aspects of their previous life and self through becoming
      physically active again, rediscovering a sense of purpose and reconnecting to
      others. Participants describe a broadening of life horizons as a result of the
      course, through new activities, being valued/respected/cared for, and being
      inspired by other people.

      application to field sports.

LID - 10.1123/ijspp.2013-0189 [doi]
AB  - Due to the broad spectrum of physical characteristics necessary for success in
      field sports, numerous training modalities have been used develop physical
      preparedness. Sports like rugby, basketball, lacrosse, and others require
      athletes to be not only strong and powerful but also aerobically fit and able to 
      recover from high-intensity intermittent exercise. This provides coaches and
      sport scientists with a complex range of variables to consider when developing
      training programs. This can often lead to confusion and the misuse of training
      modalities, particularly in the development of aerobic and anaerobic
      conditioning. This review outlines the benefits and general adaptations to 3
      commonly used and effective conditioning methods: high-intensity interval
      training, repeated-sprint training, and small-sided games. The goals and outcomes
      of these training methods are discussed, and practical implementations strategies
      for coaches and sport scientists are provided.

LID - 10.2478/hukin-2013-0011 [doi]
AB  - This study is a contribution to the discussion about the structure of performance
      of sport rock climbers. Because of the complex and multifaceted nature of this
      sport, multivariate statistics were applied in the study. The subjects included
      thirty experienced sport climbers. Forty three variables were scrutinised, namely
      somatic characteristics, specific physical fitness, coordination abilities,
      aerobic and anaerobic power, technical and tactical skills, mental
      characteristics, as well as 2 variables describing the climber's performance in
      the OS (Max OS) and RP style (Max RP). The results show that for training
      effectiveness of advanced climbers to be thoroughly analysed and examined, tests 
      assessing their physical, technical and mental characteristics are necessary. The
      three sets of variables used in this study explained the structure of performance
      similarly, but not identically (in 38, 33 and 25%, respectively). They were also 
      complementary to around 30% of the variance. The overall performance capacity of 
      a sport rock climber (Max OS and Max RP) was also evaluated in the study. The
      canonical weights of the dominant first canonical root were 0.554 and 0.512 for
      Max OS and Max RP, respectively. Despite the differences between the two styles
      of climbing, seven variables - the maximal relative strength of the fingers
      (canonical weight = 0.490), mental endurance (one of scales : The Formal
      Characteristics of Behaviour-Temperament Inventory (FCB-TI; Strelau and Zawadzki,
      1995)) (-0.410), climbing technique (0.370), isometric endurance of the fingers
      (0.340), the number of errors in the complex reaction time test (-0.319), the ape
      index (-0.319) and oxygen uptake during arm work at the anaerobic threshold
      (0.254) were found to explain 77% of performance capacity common to the two
      styles.

TI  - Acculturation in elite sport: a thematic analysis of immigrant athletes and
      coaches.
PG  - 1676-86
LID - 10.1080/02640414.2013.794949 [doi]
AB  - To identify key issues concerning the acculturation of immigrant athletes in
      sport psychology, a thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006) was conducted on
      focus group interview data from immigrant elite athletes relocated to Canada (n =
      13) and coaches working with such athletes (n = 10). Two central themes were
      identified: (a) navigating two world views which referred to acculturation as a
      fluid process where athletes navigated between cultural norms of the home
      community and the host community, and (b) acculturation loads, which referred to 
      whether immigrants and those in the host country shared acculturation (i.e.,
      acculturation as a two-way process) or managed the load with or without support
      from others (i.e., acculturation as one-directional). Each of these central
      themes comprised sub-themes, which provided further insight into the experiences 
      of acculturation for immigrant elite athletes. From the project, the authors
      recommend further research utilising case studies to provide a holistic
      description of the acculturation process from the vantage of various people
      within the sport context.

TI  - The sports performance application of vibration exercise for warm-up, flexibility
      and sprint speed.
PG  - 256-71
LID - 10.1080/17461391.2011.606837 [doi]
AB  - Since the turn of the 21st century, there has been a resurgence of vibration
      technology to enhance sport science especially for power and force development.
      However, vibration exercise has been trialled in other areas that are central to 
      athlete performance such as warm-up, flexibility and sprint speed. Therefore, the
      aim of this review was to attempt to gain a better understanding of how acute and
      short-term vibration exercise may impact on warm-up, flexibility and sprint
      speed. The importance of warming up for sporting performance has been well
      documented and vibration exercise has the capability to be included or used as a 
      standalone warm-up modality to increase intramuscular temperature at a faster
      rate compared to other conventional warm-up modalities. However, vibration
      exercise does not provide any additional neurogenic benefits compared to
      conventional dynamic and passive warm-up interventions. Vibration exercise
      appears to be a safe modality that does not produce any adverse affects causing
      injury or harm and could be used during interval and substitution breaks, as it
      would incur a low metabolic cost and be time-efficient compared to conventional
      warm-up modalities. Acute or short-term vibration exercise can enhance
      flexibility and range of motion without having a detrimental effect on muscle
      power, however it is less clear which mechanisms may be responsible for this
      enhancement. It appears that vibration exercise is not capable of improving
      sprint speed performance; this could be due to the complex and dynamic nature of 
      sprinting where the purported increase in muscle power from vibration exercise is
      probably lost on repeated actions of high force generation. Vibration exercise is
      a safe modality that produces no adverse side effects for injury or harm. It has 
      the time-efficient capability of providing coaches, trainers, and exercise
      specialists with an alternative modality that can be implemented for warm-up and 
      flexibility either in isolation or in conjunction with other conventional
      training methods.

PG  - 1249-54
LID - 10.2105/AJPH.2012.301107 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: I sought to describe current state-wide youth sports traumatic brain 
      injury (TBI) laws and their relationship to prevailing scientific understandings 
      of youth sports TBIs, and to facilitate further research by creating an
      open-source data set of current laws. METHODS: I used Westlaw and LexisNexis
      databases to create a 50-state data set of youth sports TBI laws enacted between 
      January 2009 and December 2012. I collected and coded the text and citations of
      each law and developed a protocol and codebook to facilitate future research.
      RESULTS: Forty-four states and Washington, DC, passed youth sports TBI laws
      between 2009 and 2012. No state's youth sports TBI law focuses on primary
      prevention. Instead, such laws focus on (1) increasing coaches' and parents'
      ability to identify and respond to TBIs and (2) reducing the immediate risk of
      multiple TBIs. CONCLUSIONS: Existing youth sports TBI laws were not designed to
      reduce initial TBIs. Evaluation is required to assess their effectiveness in
      reducing the risk and consequences of multiple TBIs. Continued research and
      evaluation of existing laws will be needed to develop a more comprehensive youth 
      TBI-reduction solution.

AB  - CONTEXT: The combination of extensive weight loss and inadequate nutritional
      strategies used to lose weight rapidly for competition in weight-category sports 
      may negatively affect athletic performance and health. OBJECTIVE: To explore the 
      reasoning of elite combat-sport athletes about rapid weight loss and regaining of
      weight before competitions. DESIGN: Qualitative study. SETTING: With grounded
      theory as a theoretical framework, we employed a cross-examinational approach
      including interviews, observations, and Internet sources. Sports observations
      were obtained at competitions and statements by combat-sport athletes were
      collected on the Internet. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Participants in the
      interviews were 14 Swedish national team athletes (9 men, 5 women; age range, 18 
      to 36 years) in 3 Olympic combat sports (wrestling, judo, and taekwondo). DATA
      COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Semistructured interviews with 14 athletes from the
      Swedish national teams in wrestling, judo, and taekwondo were conducted at a
      location of each participant's choice. The field observations were conducted at
      European competitions in these 3 sports. In addition, interviews and statements
      made by athletes in combat sports were collected on the Internet. RESULTS:
      Positive aspects of weight regulation other than gaining physical advantage
      emerged from the data during the analysis: sport identity, mental diversion, and 
      mental advantage. Together and individually, these categories point toward the
      positive aspects of weight regulation experienced by the athletes. Practicing
      weight regulation mediates a self-image of being "a real athlete." Weight
      regulation is also considered mentally important as a part of the precompetition 
      preparation, serving as a coping strategy by creating a feeling of increased
      focus and commitment. Moreover, a mental advantage relative to one's opponents
      can be gained through the practice of weight regulation. CONCLUSIONS: Weight
      regulation has mentally important functions extending beyond the common notion
      that combat-sport athletes reduce their weight merely to gain a physical edge
      over their opponents.

AB  - Sports psychologists play an important role in enhancing performance among
      athletes. In conjunction with team physicians, they can also shed light on
      psychological disorders common in athletes, such as mood and eating disorders,
      and overtraining syndrome. Sports psychologists can also lend their expertise to 
      assist with injury prevention and recovery and compliance issues. Sports
      psychology has a role in helping to reverse the growing obesity epidemic among
      school-aged children. These professionals, working with coaches, can increase
      children's levels of physical activity. Cognitive-behavioral techniques could
      lead to enhanced enjoyment, increased participation, improved school performance,
      and a reduction in obesity.

TI  - Psychophysiological and stress responses to competition in team sport coaches: an
      exploratory study.
PG  - e279-85
LID - 10.1111/sms.12075 [doi]
AB  - Examinations of stress in coaches have mainly been qualitative and focused on
      chronic stressors. This exploratory study examined stress responses in coaches
      during competition, including psychological and physiological indices. Using
      reversal theory, we examined metamotivational state profiles during competition. 
      Ten male team sport coaches (mean age 39.8 +/- 13.12 years) reported levels of
      subjective stress, pleasant and unpleasant emotions, metamotivational state, and 
      provided saliva samples, on a competition day: 15 min prior to the pre-match team
      talk; start of the match; end of the first half; start of the second half, and
      end of the match, then at equivalent times on a noncompetition day. Saliva
      samples were assayed for alpha-amylase activity. On competition day,
      alpha-amylase activity was significantly higher, as were subjective stress,
      arousal, and unpleasant emotions. Prior to and during active play, participants
      were mainly in the conformist, alloic (other-oriented), and mastery states, and
      at the end of the match, in the telic and sympathy states. Only 22
      metamotivational state reversals were observed, mostly at the start and end of
      the match. The elevated levels of subjective stress, alpha-amylase activity, and 
      unpleasant emotions suggest that educational programs may be useful for some
      coaches to manage psychological states during competition.

AB  - Based on social-learning and self-determination motivational theories, the
      purpose of this study was to determine the sources of motivation in youth and
      young adults with intellectual disability (ID) who participate in Special
      Olympics (SO) competitions and those of typically developed (TD) age- and
      activity-matched athletes. A convenience sample of 63 SO (25 females and 38
      males) and 59 TD (16 females and 43 males) athletes was retrieved through
      communication with local club coaches. Three sub-groups of SO athletes were
      identified based on disability, including non specified intellectual disability
      (NSID=39), Down syndrome (DS=17), and Autism (Aut=7). Mean SO and TD athlete ages
      were 20.35 (SD=7) and 18.8 (SD=8), respectively. For analysis purposes four age
      groups were created (<15, 15-17, 18-20, >20 years). Participants completed the
      13-item, two-factor Task and Ego Orientation in Sport Questionnaire (TEOSQ) and a
      16-item four-factor abridged version of the Sport Motivation Scale (SMS). SO and 
      TD athletes were active in swimming (54 and 48, respectively) and basketball (9
      and 11, respectively). Groups with and without ID were compared by means of
      t-tests in the dichotomized variables gender and activity, as well as by 1-way
      ANOVA with Tukey HSD post hoc comparisons across disability and age groups.
      Gender distribution was the same in both groups. Participants with DS and NSID
      scored significantly higher than TD athletes in most motivational scales.
      Participants with ID increased their external motivation with increasing age,
      while a reversed pattern was observed in TD. In summary, significant differences 
      between motivational patterns of SO athletes with ID and TD athletes can be
      observed. These differences should be considered when developing training and
      competition programs.

      Maison Blanche public health facility organised a sports discovery day with a
      specialised partner, the French Federation of Adapted Sport (FFSA). Feedback on
      the day revealed a high level of satisfaction. Such initiatives favour physical

AB  - Although "hot hands" in basketball are illusory, the belief in them is so robust 
      that it not only has sparked many debates but may also affect the behavior of
      players and coaches. On the basis of an entire National Basketball Association
      season's worth of data, the research reported here shows that even a single
      successful shot suffices to increase a player's likelihood of taking the next
      team shot, increase the average distance from which this next shot is taken,
      decrease the probability that this next shot is successful, and decrease the
      probability that the coach will replace the player.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Experiential knowledge of elite athletes and coaches was investigated
      to reveal insights on expertise acquisition in cricket fast bowling. DESIGN:
      Twenty-one past or present elite cricket fast bowlers and coaches of national or 
      international level were interviewed using an in-depth, open-ended,
      semi-structured approach. METHODS: Participants were asked about specific factors
      which they believed were markers of fast bowling expertise potential. Of specific
      interest was the relative importance of each potential component of fast bowling 
      expertise and how components interacted or developed over time. RESULTS: The
      importance of intrinsic motivation early in development was highlighted, along
      with physical, psychological and technical attributes. Results supported a
      multiplicative and interactive complex systems model of talent development in
      fast bowling, in which component weightings were varied due to individual
      differences in potential experts. Dropout rates in potential experts were
      attributed to misconceived current talent identification programmes and coaching 
      practices, early maturation and physical attributes, injuries and lack of key
      psychological attributes and skills. CONCLUSIONS: Data are consistent with a
      dynamical systems model of expertise acquisition in fast bowling, with numerous
      trajectories available for talent development. Further work is needed to relate
      experiential and theoretical knowledge on expertise in other sports.

PG  - 965-9
LID - 10.1136/bjsports-2012-091340 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The knowledge concerning the long-term effect of former anabolic
      androgenic steroids (AAS)-use on mental health is sparse. AIM: This study aims to
      investigate whether previous AAS-use affects mental health, present
      sociodemographic data, sport activity and substance abuse in a retrospective
      30-year follow-up study of former elite athletes. METHODS: Swedish male-elite
      power sport athletes (n=683) on the top 10 national ranking lists during any of
      the years 1960-1979 in wrestling, Olympic lifting, powerlifting and the throwing 
      events in track and field answered a questionnaire. RESULTS: At least 20% of the 
      former athletes admitted previous AAS-use. They had more often sought
      professional expertise for mental problems and had used illicit drugs compared to
      those not having used AAS. The AAS-users also differed in former sport activity
      pattern compared to non AAS-users. CONCLUSIONS: It is clear that a relationship
      exists between use of AAS and mental-health problems. Further studies need to be 
      done in order to clarify this relationship.

TI  - Coach selections and the relative age effect in male youth ice hockey.
PG  - 126-30
AB  - Relative age effects (RAEs; when relatively older children possess participation 
      and performance advantages over relatively younger children) are frequent in male
      team sports. One possible explanation is that coaches select players based on
      physical attributes, which are more likely witnessed in relatively older
      athletes. PURPOSE: To determine if coach selections are responsible for RAEs by
      comparing RAEs in male players who played competitive versus noncompetitive ice
      hockey. METHODS: Using chi-square, we analyzed the birth dates of 147,991 male
      ice hockey players who were 5 to 17 years old. Players' birth dates were divided 
      into four quartiles, beginning with January to March, which coincides with Hockey
      Canada's selection year. RESULTS: There were strong RAEs (p < .001) when players 
      were selected to competitive teams by coaches through a tryout system. On
      noncompetitive teams that did not have coach selections, there were strong RAEs
      (p < .001) from 5 to 8 years old, but not 9 to 17 years old. CONCLUSIONS:
      Although coaches might perpetuate RAEs, other influential social agents might
      include parents, which ought to be investigated in future research.

      by participants of the second International Scientific Tendinopathy Symposium
      (ISTS) Vancouver 2012.
PG  - 536-44
LID - 10.1136/bjsports-2013-092329 [doi]
AB  - In September 2010, the first International Scientific Tendinopathy Symposium
      (ISTS) was held in Umea, Sweden, to establish a forum for original scientific and
      clinical insights in this growing field of clinical research and practice. The
      second ISTS was organised by the same group and held in Vancouver, Canada, in
      September 2012. This symposium was preceded by a round-table meeting in which the
      participants engaged in focused discussions, resulting in the following overview 
      of tendinopathy clinical and research issues. This paper is a narrative review
      and summary developed during and after the second ISTS. The document is designed 
      to highlight some key issues raised at ISTS 2012, and to integrate them into a
      shared conceptual framework. It should be considered an update and a signposting 
      document rather than a comprehensive review. The document is developed for use by
      physiotherapists, physicians, athletic trainers, massage therapists and other
      health professionals as well as team coaches and strength/conditioning managers
      involved in care of sportspeople or workers with tendinopathy.

AB  - Due to pressures within the sport environment, such as from coaches, teammates,
      uniforms and judges, female athletes may develop unhealthy eating practices to
      lose weight or change their body size/shape to become more competitive and meet
      societal and sport-related physique ideals. However, up until the development of 
      the Weight Pressures in Sport for Females (WPS-F; Reel, SooHoo, Petrie,
      Greenleaf, & Carter, 2010) there was no way to quantify sport-specific weight
      pressures with female athletes. In this study, the psychometric properties of the
      scale were further examined using a sample of 414 female collegiate athletes.
      Sample 1 [n=207; M=19.27 years; SD=1.16] and Sample 2 [n=207; M=19.19 years;
      SD=1.66] participants were of a similar age and were used for exploratory and
      confirmatory analyses respectively. A two factor structure was confirmed and it
      was established that the scale was unique from general sociocultural pressures
      that all women experience, predicting female athletes' internalization, body
      dissatisfaction, dietary intent, and bulimic symptomatology. Specifically, the
      following factors, Coach and Sport Pressures about Weight (Factor 1) and
      Pressures Regarding Appearance and Performance (Factor 2), were found to have
      strong internal consistency and the emerging reliable and valid WPS-F has
      practical implications for screening and identifying weight-related sport
      pressures within female athletes. WPS-F can also serve to educate sport
      professionals about environmental pressures so that disordered eating and body
      image disturbances can be prevented.

TI  - Mechanisms of team-sport-related brain injuries in children 5 to 19 years old:
      opportunities for prevention.
PG  - e58868
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0058868 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a gap in knowledge about the mechanisms of sports-related
      brain injuries. The objective of this study was to determine the mechanisms of
      brain injuries among children and youth participating in team sports. METHODS: We
      conducted a retrospective case series of brain injuries suffered by children
      participating in team sports. The Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and
      Prevention Program (CHIRPP) database was searched for brain injury cases among
      5-19 year-olds playing ice hockey, soccer, American football (football),
      basketball, baseball, or rugby between 1990 and 2009. Mechanisms of injury were
      classified as "struck by player," "struck by object," "struck by sport
      implement," "struck surface," and "other." A descriptive analysis was performed. 
      RESULTS: There were 12,799 brain injuries related to six team sports (16.2% of
      all brain injuries registered in CHIRPP). Males represented 81% of injuries and
      the mean age was 13.2 years. Ice hockey accounted for the greatest number of
      brain injuries (44.3%), followed by soccer (19.0%) and football (12.9%). In ice
      hockey, rugby, and basketball, striking another player was the most common injury
      mechanism. Football, basketball, and soccer also demonstrated high proportions of
      injuries due to contact with an object (e.g., post) among younger players. In
      baseball, a common mechanism in the 5-9 year-old group was being hit with a bat
      as a result of standing too close to the batter (26.1% males, 28.3% females).
      INTERPRETATION: Many sports-related brain injury mechanisms are preventable. The 
      results suggest that further efforts aimed at universal rule changes, safer
      playing environments, and the education of coaches, players, and parents should
      be targeted in maximizing prevention of sport-related brain injury using a
      multifaceted approach.

TI  - The Hip Sports Activity Scale (HSAS) for patients with femoroacetabular
      impingement.
PG  - 204-11
LID - 10.5301/hipint.5000006 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To develop and validate a sports activity scale for patients with a
      diagnosis of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). METHODS: A nine level Hip Sports
      Activity Scale (HSAS) was constructed both in German and English languages.
      Fifty-nine consecutive patients undergoing surgical treatment for FAI at two
      centers in Switzerland and in the US completed a questionnaire set consisting of 
      the HSAS, the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) activity scale and
      different hip joint-specific and generic outcome tools. For reliability
      assessment, the HSAS was completed twice about nine days apart. Evidence of
      reliability, validity and responsiveness was investigated by classical
      psychometric analyses. RESULTS: Reliability was excellent for both the German and
      the English versions with intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.94 and 0.96,
      respectively. Evidence of convergent validity was supported by moderate to high
      correlations with the UCLA activity scale and with the joint-specific measures
      used. Evidence of divergent validity was supported by low correlations with the
      SF-12 Mental Component Scale and the WOMAC stiffness subscale. The standardised
      response mean was 0.69. CONCLUSIONS: The HSAS is a reliable and valid tool to
      determine sports levels in patients suffering from FAI. Its use in future studies
      investigating outcomes in young patients with hip disease can be recommended.
      LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, Diagnostic Studies - An independent, masked
      comparison with an appropriate population of patients, but reference standard not
      applied to all study patients.

PG  - 180-96
AB  - The series of related studies reported here describe the development and
      validation of the Organizational Stressor Indicator for Sport Performers
      (OSI-SP). In study 1, an expert and usability panel examined the content validity
      and applicability of an initial item pool. The resultant 96 items were analyzed
      with exploratory factor analyses in Study 2, with the factorial structure
      comprising 5 factors (viz., goals and development, logistics and operations, team
      and culture, coaching, selection) and 33 items. Using confirmatory factor
      analyses, Studies 3 and 4 found support for the 5-factor structure. Study 4 also 
      provided evidence for the OSI-SP's concurrent validity and invariance across
      different groups. The OSI-SP is proposed as a valid and reliable measure of the
      organizational stressors encountered by sport performers.

TI  - An attachment theory perspective in the examination of relational processes
      associated with coach-athlete dyads.
PG  - 156-67
AB  - The aim of the current study was to examine actor and partner effects of (a)
      athletes' and coaches' attachment styles (avoidant and anxious) on the quality of
      the coach-athlete relationship, and (b) athletes' and coaches' quality of the
      coach-athlete relationship on relationship satisfaction employing the
      actor-partner interdependence model (Kenny, Kashy, & Cook, 2006). Coaches (N =
      107) and athletes (N = 107) completed a questionnaire related to attachment
      styles, relationship quality, and relationship satisfaction. Structural equation 
      model analyses revealed (a) actor effects for coaches' and athletes' avoidant
      attachment styles on their own perception of relationship quality and coaches'
      and athletes' perception of relationship quality on their own perception of
      relationship satisfaction, and (b) partner effects for athletes' avoidant
      attachment style on coaches' perceptions of relationship quality and for coaches'
      perceptions of relationship quality on athletes' perceptions of relationship
      satisfaction. The findings highlight that attachments styles can help us
      understand the processes involved in the formation and maintenance of quality
      relational bonds between coaches and athletes.

TI  - Doping in sport: a review of elite athletes' attitudes, beliefs, and knowledge.
PG  - 395-411
LID - 10.1007/s40279-013-0037-x [doi]
AB  - Doping in sport is a well-known phenomenon that has been studied mainly from a
      biomedical point of view, even though psychosocial approaches are also key
      factors in the fight against doping. This phenomenon has evolved greatly in
      recent years, and greater understanding of it is essential for developing
      efficient prevention programmes. In the psychosocial approach, attitudes are
      considered an index of doping behaviour, relating the use of banned substances to
      greater leniency towards doping. The aim of this review is to gather and
      critically analyse the most recent publications describing elite athletes'
      attitudes, beliefs and knowledge of doping in sport, to better understand the
      foundations provided by the previous work, and to help develop practical
      strategies to efficiently combat doping. For this purpose, we performed a
      literature search using combinations of the terms "doping", "sport", "elite
      athletes", "attitudes", "beliefs", "knowledge", "drugs", and
      "performance-enhancing substances" (PES). A total of 33 studies were subjected to
      comprehensive assessment using articles published between 2000 and 2011. All of
      the reports focused on elite athletes and described their attitudes, beliefs and 
      knowledge of doping in sport. The initial reasons given for using banned
      substances included achievement of athletic success by improving performance,
      financial gain, improving recovery and prevention of nutritional deficiencies, as
      well as the idea that others use them, or the "false consensus effect". Although 
      most athletes acknowledge that doping is cheating, unhealthy and risky because of
      sanctions, its effectiveness is also widely recognized. There is a general belief
      about the inefficacy of anti-doping programmes, and athletes criticise the way
      tests are carried out. Most athletes consider the severity of punishment is
      appropriate or not severe enough. There are some differences between sports, as
      team-based sports and sports requiring motor skills could be less influenced by
      doping practices than individual self-paced sports. However, anti-doping controls
      are less exhaustive in team sports. The use of banned substance also differs
      according to the demand of the specific sport. Coaches appear to be the main
      influence and source of information for athletes, whereas doctors and other
      specialists do not seem to act as principal advisors. Athletes are becoming
      increasingly familiar with anti-doping rules, but there is still a lack of
      knowledge that should be remedied using appropriate educational programmes. There
      is also a lack of information on dietary supplements and the side effects of PES.
      Therefore, information and prevention are necessary, and should cater to the
      athletes and associated stakeholders. This will allow us to establish and
      maintain correct attitudes towards doping. Psychosocial programmes must be
      carefully planned and developed, and should include middle- to long-term
      objectives (e.g. changing attitudes towards doping and the doping culture). Some 
      institutions have developed or started prevention or educational programmes
      without the necessary resources, while the majority of the budget is spent on
      anti-doping testing. Controls are obviously needed, as well as more efficient
      educational strategies. Therefore, we encourage sporting institutions to invest
      in educational programmes aimed at discouraging the use of banned substances.
      Event organizers and sport federations should work together to adapt the rules of
      each competition to disincentivize dopers. Current research methods are weak,
      especially questionnaires. A combination of qualitative and quantitative
      measurements are recommended, using interviews, questionnaires and, ideally,
      biomedical tests. Studies should also examine possible geographical and cultural 
      differences in attitudes towards doping.

AB  - In many sports, it is common for top coaching positions to be held by former
      players; however, despite the natural progression in many sports for skilled
      players to become high level coaches, we have little understanding of how playing
      may develop useful skills for coaching. In this study we considered
      perceptual-cognitive skill across groups of high and low-skilled soccer players
      and soccer coaches. A range of perceptual-cognitive variables was measured in an 
      attempt to capture the diverse skills related to expertise in sport and coaching.
      Generally, results highlighted similarities between coaches and players on some
      tasks and differences on others.

TI  - Football Fans in Training: the development and optimization of an intervention
      delivered through professional sports clubs to help men lose weight, become more 
      active and adopt healthier eating habits.
PG  - 232
LID - 10.1186/1471-2458-13-232 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of obesity in men is rising, but they are less likely 
      than women to engage in existing weight management programmes. The potential of
      professional sports club settings to engage men in health promotion activities is
      being increasingly recognised. This paper describes the development and
      optimization of the Football Fans in Training (FFIT) programme, which aims to
      help overweight men (many of them football supporters) lose weight through
      becoming more active and adopting healthier eating habits. METHODS: The MRC
      Framework for the design and evaluation of complex interventions was used to
      guide programme development in two phases. In Phase 1, a multidisciplinary
      working group developed the pilot programme (p-FFIT) and used a scoping review to
      summarize previous research and identify the target population. Phase 2 involved 
      a process evaluation of p-FFIT in 11 Scottish Premier League (SPL) clubs.
      Participant and coach feedback, focus group discussions and interviews explored
      the utility/acceptability of programme components and suggestions for changes.
      Programme session observations identified examples of good practice and
      problems/issues with delivery. Together, these findings informed redevelopment of
      the optimized programme (FFIT), whose components were mapped onto specific
      behaviour change techniques using an evidence-based taxonomy. RESULTS: p-FFIT
      comprised 12, weekly, gender-sensitised, group-based weight management classroom 
      and 'pitch-side' physical activity sessions. These in-stadia sessions were
      complemented by an incremental, pedometer-based walking programme. p-FFIT was
      targeted at men aged 35-65 years with body mass index >/= 27 kg/m(2). Phase 2
      demonstrated that participants in p-FFIT were enthusiastic about both the
      classroom and physical activity components, and valued the camaraderie and
      peer-support offered by the programme. Coaches appreciated the simplicity of the 
      key healthy eating and physical activity messages. Suggestions for improvements
      that were incorporated into the optimized FFIT programme included: more varied
      in-stadia physical activity with football-related components; post-programme
      weight management support (emails and a reunion session); and additional training
      for coaches in SMART goal setting and the pedometer-based walking programme.
      CONCLUSIONS: The Football Fans in Training programme is highly acceptable to
      participants and SPL coaches, and is appropriate for evaluation in a randomised
      controlled trial.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the reach and adoption of a coach-led exercise training
      programme for lower limb injury prevention. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of data
      from a group-clustered randomised controlled trial. SETTING: A periodised
      exercise training warm-up programme was delivered to players during training
      sessions over an 8-week preseason (weeks 1-8) and 18-week playing season.
      PARTICIPANTS: 1564 community Australian football players. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASUREMENTS: Reach, measured weekly, was the number of players who attended
      training sessions. Adoption was the number of attending players who completed the
      programme in full, partially or not at all. Reasons for partial or
      non-participation were recorded. RESULTS: In week 1, 599 players entered the
      programme; 55% attended 1 training session and 45% attended > 1 session. By week 
      12, 1540 players were recruited but training attendance (reach) decreased to
      <50%. When players attended training, the majority adopted the full
      programme-ranging from 96% (week 1) to above 80% until week 20. The most common
      reasons for low adoption were players being injured, too sore, being late for
      training or choosing their own warm-up. CONCLUSIONS: The training programme's
      reach was highest preseason and halved at the playing season's end. However, when
      players attended training sessions, their adoption was high and remained close to
      70% by season end. For sports injury prevention programmes to be fully effective 
      across a season, attention also needs to be given to (1) encouraging players to
      attend formal training sessions and (2) considering the possibility of some form 
      of programme delivery outside of formal training.

AB  - Sports clubs create conditions for people of all ages to pursue a healthy
      lifestyle through exercise in sports and attend to constructive pedagogical work 
      which creates much value for society. This study investigates the relationship
      between adolescents' sports clubs participation and self-reported mental and
      physical conditions and future expectations. The participants were 10,987 pupils 
      in the final three years of their compulsory education in Iceland (aged 14-16
      years). The participants completed questionnaires administered to students in the
      classroom relating to health and behaviour. The results indicate that
      participation in sports clubs influences adolescents positively; adolescents who 
      work hard at sport not only believe they are in better mental and physical
      condition, they also believe they can succeed in other areas such as their
      studies. Sports clubs promote positive influence on adolescents' mental and
      physical conditions and their future expectations toward work and happiness. It
      can be concluded that participation in organised sports clubs affects the
      participants in a positive way.

TI  - Psycho-social factors determining success in high-performance triathlon: compared
      perception in the coach-athlete pair.
PG  - 865-80
AB  - High-level sport can be analyzed using the complex system model, in which
      performance is constrained by many factors. Coaches' and athletes' perceptions of
      important positive and negative factors affecting performance were compared.
      Participants were 48 high-level international triathletes (n = 34) and their
      coaches (n = 14). They were personally interviewed via a questionnaire designed
      by four accredited experts, who selected groups of both positive and negative
      factors affecting performance. A list of factors was developed, in order of
      greater to lesser importance in the opinion of athletes and coaches, for
      subsequent analysis. Two ranked lists (positive and negative factors) indicated
      that athletes appear to rate personal environment factors (family, teammates,
      lack of support from relatives) higher, while the coaches tended to give more
      importance to technical and institutional aspects (institutional support, coach, 
      medical support). There was complete agreement between coaches and triathletes
      about the top five positive factors. Negative factor agreement was somewhat lower
      (agreement on 3/5 factors). The most important positive factor for coaches and
      athletes was "dedication/engagement," while the most important factor adversely
      affecting performance was "injuries".

TI  - A conditional process model of children's behavioral engagement and behavioral
      disaffection in sport based on self-determination theory.
PG  - 30-43
AB  - The potential benefits of children's engagement in sport for their psychological,
      social, and physical health are well established. Yet children may also
      experience psychological and social impairments due, in part, to a variety of
      detrimental coach behaviors. In the current study, we proposed and tested a
      conditional process model of children's self-reported behavioral engagement and
      behavioral disaffection in sport based on self-determination theory. Results from
      a sample of 245 youth soccer players suggested that structure from coaches
      related positively to behavioral engagement and negatively to behavioral
      disaffection, and that these relations were mediated by athletes' basic
      psychological need satisfaction. Importantly, and in line with our hypotheses,
      these indirect effects were moderated by autonomy support from coaches, such that
      the mediation was evident only among those who reported higher levels of autonomy
      support. These findings underscore the importance of coaches' providing guidance,
      expectations, and feedback (i.e., structure) in a way that respects athletes'
      volition (i.e., autonomy support).

AB  - Coaching has been recognised as a demanding occupation, associated with a range
      of stressors. The extent to which coaches perceive stress is likely to be
      influenced by various personal and situational factors. The purpose of this study
      was to identify coaches' levels of perceived stress and examine the personal and 
      situational factors that may influence coaches' perceptions of stress. In total, 
      502 coaches working with university, college, Canada Games, and/or nationally
      identified athletes completed this study. Coaches completed an online survey,
      which included questions regarding demographics, work/job-related considerations,
      and aspects relating to their contract. Coaches also completed the Perceived
      Stress Scale (Cohen, Kamarck, & Mermelstein, 1983). Overall coaches indicated
      slightly below average levels of perceived stress (M = 15.13 out of 40) compared 
      with norm-values (Cohen & Janicki-Deverts, 2012). Demographic factors,
      job-related characteristics, and certain aspects of their contract were
      associated with coaches' perceptions of stress. In particular, unclear
      expectations, long-working hours (>40), lack of agreed evaluation criteria,
      higher salaries, and a lack of social support were related to higher perceptions 
      of stress. As such, the findings of the current study indicate that a reduction
      in perceived stress is likely to be achieved through a multifaceted approach that
      addresses multiple factors associated with coaching.

TI  - Disability, body image and sports/physical activity in adult survivors of
      childhood CNS tumors: population-based outcomes from a cohort study.
PG  - 99-106
LID - 10.1007/s11060-012-1039-5 [doi]
AB  - Childhood CNS tumor survivors risk health and functional impairments that
      threaten normal psychological development and self-perception. This study
      investigated the extent to which health and functional ability predict adult
      survivors' body image (BI) and self-confidence regarding sports and physical
      activity. The study cohort covered 708 eligible >/= 18 year old CNS tumor
      survivors, and data from 528 (75 %) were analyzed. Disability was estimated using
      the Health Utilities Index Mark2/3, a multidimensional self-report instrument.
      Physical self-confidence in terms of BI and sports/physical activity-related
      self-confidence (SPAS) were assessed using the BI and the Sports/Athletics
      modules of a standardized self-report assessment scale. In adjusted regression
      models, global health and functional status (GHFS) predicted BI (B = 0.94, 95 %
      CI 0.69-1.19) and SPAS (B = 0.79, 95 % CI 0.55-1.04). Emotion and pain, and to a 
      lesser degree cognition, speech and vision disability, were associated with
      poorer BI and SPAS. Gender, sub-diagnosis, and time since diagnosis influenced
      the relationship between health status and physical self-confidence outcomes.
      Females had poorer GHFS, BI and SPAS than males. Decreased health and functional 
      ability following childhood CNS cancer intrudes on physical self-confidence, with
      females being at heightened risk for both disability and negative
      self-confidence. Identified disability and gender-related risk calls for a
      follow-up plan that integrates treatment of psychological sequelae in lifetime
      monitoring of childhood CNS tumor survivors to restore and protect self-image and
      self-confidence, essential mental health correlates. An expanded plan should
      recognize the need for such services, optimizing life-long quality of survival
      for CNS tumor survivors.

TI  - Ensuring implementation success: how should coach injury prevention education be 
      improved if we want coaches to deliver safety programmes during training
      sessions?
PG  - 402-3
LID - 10.1136/bjsports-2012-091987 [doi]
AB  - Coaches play a major role in encouraging and ensuring that participants of their 
      teams adopt appropriate safety practices. However, the extent to which the
      coaches undertake this role will depend upon their attitudes about injury
      prevention, their perceptions of what the other coaches usually do and their own 
      beliefs about how much control they have in delivering such programmes. Fifty-one
      junior netball coaches were surveyed about incorporating the teaching of correct 
      (safe) landing technique during their delivery of training sessions to junior
      players. Overall, >94% of coaches had strongly positive attitudes towards
      teaching correct landing technique and >80% had strongly positive perceptions of 
      their own control over delivering such programmes. Coaches' ratings of social
      norms relating to what others think about teaching safe landing were more
      positive (>94%) than those relating to what others actually do (63-74%). In
      conclusion, the junior coaches were generally receptive towards delivering safe
      landing training programmes in the training sessions they led. Future coach
      education could include role modelling by prominent coaches so that more
      community-level coaches are aware that this is a behaviour that many coaches can,
      and do, engage in.

TI  - Recognition and management of traumatic sports injuries in the skeletally
      immature athlete.
PG  - 691-704
AB  - Over the last decade, participation in organized youth sports has risen to
      include over 35 million contestants.(1) The rise in participation has brought
      about an associated increase in both traumatic and overuse injuries in the youth 
      athlete, which refers to both children and adolescents within a general age range
      of seven to 17. Exposure rates alone do not account for the increase in injuries.
      Societal pressures to perform at high levels affect both coaches and athletes and
      lead to inappropriate levels of training intensity, frequency, and duration. In
      this environment high physiologic stresses are applied to the immature skeleton
      of the youth athlete causing injury. Typically, since bone is the weakest link in
      the incomplete ossified skeleton, the majority of traumatic injuries result in
      fractures that occur both at mid-shaft and at the growth centers of bone. The
      following clinical commentary describes the common traumatic sports injuries that
      occur in youth athletes, as well as those which require rapid identification and 
      care in order to prevent long term sequelae.

TI  - The ergonomics of wheelchair configuration for optimal performance in the
      wheelchair court sports.
PG  - 23-38
LID - 10.1007/s40279-012-0005-x [doi]
AB  - Optimizing mobility performance in wheelchair court sports (basketball, rugby and
      tennis) is dependent on a combination of factors associated with the user, the
      wheelchair and the interfacing between the two. Substantial research has been
      attributed to the wheelchair athlete yet very little has focused on the role of
      the wheelchair and the wheelchair-user combination. This article aims to review
      relevant scientific literature that has investigated the effects of wheelchair
      configuration on aspects of mobility performance from an ergonomics perspective. 
      Optimizing performance from an ergonomics perspective requires a
      multidisciplinary approach. This has resulted in laboratory-based investigations 
      incorporating a combination of physiological and biomechanical analyses to assess
      the efficiency, health/safety and comfort of various wheelchair configurations.
      To a lesser extent, field-based testing has also been incorporated to determine
      the effects of wheelchair configuration on aspects of mobility performance
      specific to the wheelchair court sports. The available literature has
      demonstrated that areas of seat positioning, rear wheel camber, wheel size and
      hand-rim configurations can all influence the ergonomics of wheelchair
      performance. Certain configurations have been found to elevate the physiological 
      demand of wheelchair propulsion, others have been associated with an increased
      risk of injury and some have demonstrated favourable performance on court. A
      consideration of all these factors is required to identify optimal wheelchair
      configurations. Unfortunately, a wide variety of different methodologies have
      immerged between studies, many of which are accompanied by limitations, thus
      making the identification of optimal configurations problematic. When
      investigating an area of wheelchair configuration, many studies have failed to
      adequately standardize other areas, which has prevented reliable cause and effect
      relationships being established. In addition, a large number of studies have
      explored the effects of wheelchair configuration in either able-bodied
      populations or in daily life or racing wheelchairs. As such, the findings are not
      specific and transferable to athletes competing in the wheelchair court sports.
      This review presents evidence about the effects of wheelchair configuration on
      aspects of mobility performance specific to the wheelchair court sports to better
      inform athletes, coaches and manufacturers about the consequences of their
      selections. It also provides researchers with guidance on the design of future
      investigations into areas of wheelchair configuration, which are essential.

TI  - Self-organization processes in field-invasion team sports : implications for
      leadership.
PG  - 1-7
LID - 10.1007/s40279-012-0001-1 [doi]
AB  - In nature, the interactions between agents in a complex system (fish schools;
      colonies of ants) are governed by information that is locally created. Each agent
      self-organizes (adjusts) its behaviour, not through a central command centre, but
      based on variables that emerge from the interactions with other system agents in 
      the neighbourhood. Self-organization has been proposed as a mechanism to explain 
      the tendencies for individual performers to interact with each other in
      field-invasion sports teams, displaying functional co-adaptive behaviours,
      without the need for central control. The relevance of self-organization as a
      mechanism that explains pattern-forming dynamics within attacker-defender
      interactions in field-invasion sports has been sustained in the literature.
      Nonetheless, other levels of interpersonal coordination, such as intra-team
      interactions, still raise important questions, particularly with reference to the
      role of leadership or match strategies that have been prescribed in advance by a 
      coach. The existence of key properties of complex systems, such as system
      degeneracy, nonlinearity or contextual dependency, suggests that
      self-organization is a functional mechanism to explain the emergence of
      interpersonal coordination tendencies within intra-team interactions. In this
      opinion article we propose how leadership may act as a key constraint on the
      emergent, self-organizational tendencies of performers in field-invasion sports.

AB  - Position Statement: The International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) bases
      the following position stand on a critical analysis of the literature on the
      safety and efficacy of the use of energy drinks (ED) or energy shots (ES). The
      ISSN has concluded the following. 1. Although ED and ES contain a number of
      nutrients that are purported to affect mental and/or physical performance, the
      primary ergogenic nutrients in most ED and ES appear to be carbohydrate and/or
      caffeine. 2. The ergogenic value of caffeine on mental and physical performance
      has been well-established but the potential additive benefits of other nutrients 
      contained in ED and ES remains to be determined. 3. Consuming ED 10-60 minutes
      before exercise can improve mental focus, alertness, anaerobic performance,
      and/or endurance performance. 4. Many ED and ES contain numerous ingredients;
      these products in particular merit further study to demonstrate their safety and 
      potential effects on physical and mental performance. 5. There is some limited
      evidence that consumption of low-calorie ED during training and/or weight loss
      trials may provide ergogenic benefit and/or promote a small amount of additional 
      fat loss. However, ingestion of higher calorie ED may promote weight gain if the 
      energy intake from consumption of ED is not carefully considered as part of the
      total daily energy intake. 6. Athletes should consider the impact of ingesting
      high glycemic load carbohydrates on metabolic health, blood glucose and insulin
      levels, as well as the effects of caffeine and other stimulants on motor skill
      performance. 7. Children and adolescents should only consider use of ED or ES
      with parental approval after consideration of the amount of carbohydrate,
      caffeine, and other nutrients contained in the ED or ES and a thorough
      understanding of the potential side effects. 8. Indiscriminant use of ED or ES,
      especially if more than one serving per day is consumed, may lead to adverse
      events and harmful side effects. 9. Diabetics and individuals with pre-existing
      cardiovascular, metabolic, hepatorenal, and neurologic disease who are taking
      medications that may be affected by high glycemic load foods, caffeine, and/or
      other stimulants should avoid use of ED and/or ES unless approved by their
      physician.

TI  - Evaluation and management of children and adolescents with sports-related
      concussion.
PG  - 31-4
AB  - Concussions are common sport injuries, and are particularly common among children
      and adolescents involved in organized sports and recreational activities.
      Symptoms of concussion can be subtle, and may be overlooked by athletes,
      coaches/trainers and parents. If a child or youth sustains a concussion, they
      should immediately be removed from play and assessed by a physician as soon as
      possible. The athlete should rest from physical and cognitive activities to allow
      for recovery from concussion. Once symptoms have completely resolved at rest, the
      athlete can progress through a medically supervised stepwise exertion protocol
      before being medically cleared to return to play. It is imperative that everyone 
      involved in child and youth sports be aware of the signs and symptoms of
      concussion so that an accurate and timely diagnosis can be made, and proper
      evaluation and management instituted. The present position statement replaces the
      previous document published in 2006.

TI  - Sport science relevance and application: perceptions of UK coaches.
PG  - 807-19
LID - 10.1080/02640414.2012.754924 [doi]
AB  - While sport science can have significant and positive impact on coaches and
      athletes, there is still a general consensus that the transfer of sport science
      knowledge to coaching is poor. Given this apparent dilemma, this study
      investigated the perceptions of sport science from coaches across four different 
      sports (football, rugby league, curling and judo) across three different levels
      (elite, developmental and novice). Specifically, 58 coaches (19 football; 21
      rugby league; 9 curling; 9 judo) drawn evenly from novice, developmental and
      elite groups agreed to take part and were interviewed. Three key features emerged
      from the analysis 1) Practical application and relevance 2) Integration and
      access, 3) Language. In short, there was significant variability in the extent to
      which sport science was considered relevant and to whom, although interestingly
      this was not strongly related to coaching level. This inconsistency of
      understanding was a barrier to sport science engagement in some instances, as was
      the challenge of operationalising information for specific contexts. Furthermore,
      availability of opportunities and resources were often left to chance, while
      overuse of jargon and inability for research and practitioners to consider sport 
      specific needs were also considered barriers to engagement. Implications for
      research and practice are discussed.

      Late.
PG  - 171
LID - 10.3389/fneur.2012.00171 [doi]
AB  - Over the past decade, there has been a considerable increase in research on, and 
      media attention to, sports-related concussion. However, despite accurate
      diagnosis, effective treatment and management of sports-related concussion have
      remained a challenge. There are approximately 1.8 million traumatic brain
      injuries in the United States annually (Faul et al., 2010) and emergency
      department pediatric visits for suspected concussion have doubled in the past
      decade (Bakhos et al., 2010). However, health care providers and medical
      researchers have yet to offer an effective, reliable evidence-based treatment for
      concussive brain injury. The Zurich 2008 Consensus Statement on Concussion in
      Sport codified the prescription for cognitive and physical rest immediately
      following a concussion based on clinical acumen and common sense (McCrory et al.,
      2009). Currently, rest is the considered the best immediate treatment for
      concussion. Other supportive and anecdotal treatments are often applied
      throughout the post-concussive recovery process to address persistent symptoms.
      The need for empirical research to translate current guidelines for rest into
      evidence-based treatment protocols is essential. A recent study evaluated the
      efficacy of comprehensive rest and concluded that such rest may be helpful
      whether applied soon after a concussion or weeks to months later (Moser et al.,
      2012). Here, we present a case illustrating the effectiveness of rest in a youth 
      athlete, commenced after experiencing 13 months of post-concussion symptoms.
      There appears to be value in applying a specific period of cognitive and physical
      rest following concussion, whether immediately or later in the recovery phase.

AB  - Many patients with Anorexia and Bulimia Nervosa (AN, BN) engage in sport and
      physical activity in an excessive and compulsive manner, mostly to influence
      weight and shape. Many of them experience guilt in case of not exercising.
      However, sport and physical exercise can also have a positive effect on mental
      illness by influencing mood, sense of self-esteem and body experience. Until now,
      only few programs for eating disorder patients exist which aim at changing
      physical activity behavior and use sport and exercise activities in a therapeutic
      way. We developed a sport-therapeutic program designed for outpatients with
      eating disorders. It supervises sport and physical exercise and helps patients to
      use sport and exercise in a healthy manner. This report presents the program's
      manual and first experiences based on half-standardized interviews.

AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STATEMENT: black triangle right To provide an evidence-based, best
      practises summary to assist physicians with the evaluation and management of
      sports concussion. black triangle right To establish the level of evidence,
      knowledge gaps and areas requiring additional research. IMPORTANCE OF AN AMSSM
      STATEMENT: black triangle right Sports medicine physicians are frequently
      involved in the care of patients with sports concussion. black triangle right
      Sports medicine physicians are specifically trained to provide care along the
      continuum of sports concussion from the acute injury to return-to-play (RTP)
      decisions. black triangle right The care of athletes with sports concussion is
      ideally performed by healthcare professionals with specific training and
      experience in the assessment and management of concussion. Competence should be
      determined by training and experience, not dictated by specialty. black triangle 
      right While this statement is directed towards sports medicine physicians, it may
      also assist other physicians and healthcare professionals in the care of patients
      with sports concussion. DEFINITION: black triangle right Concussion is defined as
      a traumatically induced transient disturbance of brain function and involves a
      complex pathophysiological process. Concussion is a subset of mild traumatic
      brain injury (MTBI) which is generally self-limited and at the less-severe end of
      the brain injury spectrum. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY: black triangle right Animal and human
      studies support the concept of postconcussive vulnerability, showing that a
      second blow before the brain has recovered results in worsening metabolic changes
      within the cell. black triangle right Experimental evidence suggests the
      concussed brain is less responsive to usual neural activation and when premature 
      cognitive or physical activity occurs before complete recovery the brain may be
      vulnerable to prolonged dysfunction. INCIDENCE: black triangle right It is
      estimated that as many as 3.8 million concussions occur in the USA per year
      during competitive sports and recreational activities; however, as many as 50% of
      the concussions may go unreported. black triangle right Concussions occur in all 
      sports with the highest incidence in football, hockey, rugby, soccer and
      basketball. RISK FACTORS FOR SPORT-RELATED CONCUSSION: black triangle right A
      history of concussion is associated with a higher risk of sustaining another
      concussion. black triangle right A greater number, severity and duration of
      symptoms after a concussion are predictors of a prolonged recovery. black
      triangle right In sports with similar playing rules, the reported incidence of
      concussion is higher in female athletes than in male athletes. black triangle
      right Certain sports, positions and individual playing styles have a greater risk
      of concussion. black triangle right Youth athletes may have a more prolonged
      recovery and are more susceptible to a concussion accompanied by a catastrophic
      injury. black triangle right Preinjury mood disorders, learning disorders,
      attention-deficit disorders (ADD/ADHD) and migraine headaches complicate
      diagnosis and management of a concussion. DIAGNOSIS OF CONCUSSION: black triangle
      right Concussion remains a clinical diagnosis ideally made by a healthcare
      provider familiar with the athlete and knowledgeable in the recognition and
      evaluation of concussion. black triangle right Graded symptom checklists provide 
      an objective tool for assessing a variety of symptoms related to concussions,
      while also tracking the severity of those symptoms over serial evaluations. black
      triangle right Standardised assessment tools provide a helpful structure for the 
      evaluation of concussion, although limited validation of these assessment tools
      is available. SIDELINE EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT: black triangle right Any
      athlete suspected of having a concussion should be stopped from playing and
      assessed by a licenced healthcare provider trained in the evaluation and
      management of concussions. black triangle right Recognition and initial
      assessment of a concussion should be guided by a symptoms checklist, cognitive
      evaluation (including orientation, past and immediate memory, new learning and
      concentration), balance tests and further neurological physical examination.
      black triangle right While standardised sideline tests are a useful framework for
      examination, the sensitivity, specificity, validity and reliability of these
      tests among different age groups, cultural groups and settings is largely
      undefined. Their practical usefulness with or without an individual baseline test
      is also largely unknown. black triangle right Balance disturbance is a specific
      indicator of a concussion, but not very sensitive. Balance testing on the
      sideline may be substantially different than baseline tests because of
      differences in shoe/cleat-type or surface, use of ankle tape or braces, or the
      presence of other lower extremity injury. black triangle right Imaging is
      reserved for athletes where intracerebral bleeding is suspected. black triangle
      right There is no same day RTP for an athlete diagnosed with a concussion. black 
      triangle right Athletes suspected or diagnosed with a concussion should be
      monitored for deteriorating physical or mental status. NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL
      TESTING: black triangle right Neuropsychological (NP) tests are an objective
      measure of brain-behaviour relationships and are more sensitive for subtle
      cognitive impairment than clinical exam. black triangle right Most concussions
      can be managed appropriately without the use of NP testing. black triangle right 
      Computerised neuropsychological (CNP) testing should be interpreted by healthcare
      professionals trained and familiar with the type of test and the individual test 
      limitations, including a knowledgeable assessment of the reliable change index,
      baseline variability and false-positive and false-negative rates. black triangle 
      right Paper and pencil NP tests can be more comprehensive, test different domains
      and assess for other conditions which may masquerade as or complicate assessment 
      of concussion. black triangle right NP testing should be used only as part of a
      comprehensive concussion management strategy and should not be used in isolation.
      black triangle right The ideal timing, frequency and type of NP testing have not 
      been determined. black triangle right In some cases, properly administered and
      interpreted NP testing provides an added value to assess cognitive function and
      recovery in the management of sports concussions. black triangle right It is
      unknown if use of NP testing in the management of sports concussion helps prevent
      recurrent concussion, catastrophic injury or long-term complications. black
      triangle right Comprehensive NP evaluation is helpful in the post-concussion
      management of athletes with persistent symptoms or complicated courses. RETURN TO
      CLASS: black triangle right Students will require cognitive rest and may require 
      academic accommodations such as reduced workload and extended time for tests
      while recovering from a concussion. RETURN TO PLAY: black triangle right
      Concussion symptoms should be resolved before returning to exercise. black
      triangle right A RTP progression involves a gradual, step-wise increase in
      physical demands, sports-specific activities and the risk for contact. black
      triangle right If symptoms occur with activity, the progression should be halted 
      and restarted at the preceding symptom-free step. black triangle right RTP after 
      concussion should occur only with medical clearance from a licenced healthcare
      provider trained in the evaluation and management of concussions. SHORT-TERM
      RISKS OF PREMATURE RTP: black triangle right The primary concern with early RTP
      is decreased reaction time leading to an increased risk of a repeat concussion or
      other injury and prolongation of symptoms. LONG-TERM EFFECTS: black triangle
      right There is an increasing concern that head impact exposure and recurrent
      concussions contribute to long-term neurological sequelae. black triangle right
      Some studies have suggested an association between prior concussions and chronic 
      cognitive dysfunction. Large-scale epidemiological studies are needed to more
      clearly define risk factors and causation of any long-term neurological
      impairment. DISQUALIFICATION FROM SPORT: black triangle right There are no
      evidence-based guidelines for disqualifying/retiring an athlete from a sport
      after a concussion. Each case should be carefully deliberated and an

      triangle right Greater efforts are needed to educate involved parties, including 
      athletes, parents, coaches, officials, school administrators and healthcare
      providers to improve concussion recognition, management and prevention. black

      potential long-term consequences of a concussion and recurrent concussions.
      PREVENTION: black triangle right Primary prevention of some injuries may be
      possible with modification and enforcement of the rules and fair play. black
      triangle right Helmets, both hard (football, lacrosse and hockey) and soft
      (soccer, rugby) are best suited to prevent impact injuries (fracture, bleeding,
      laceration, etc.) but have not been shown to reduce the incidence and severity of
      concussions. black triangle right There is no current evidence that mouth guards 
      can reduce the severity of or prevent concussions. black triangle right Secondary
      prevention may be possible by appropriate RTP management. LEGISLATION: black

      non-scholastic sports organisations regarding concussion safety and management.
      FUTURE DIRECTIONS: black triangle right Additional research is needed to validate
      current assessment tools, delineate the role of NP testing and improve
      identification of those at risk of prolonged post-concussive symptoms or other
      long-term complications. black triangle right Evolving technologies for the
      diagnosis of concussion, such as newer neuroimaging techniques or biological
      markers, may provide new insights into the evaluation and management of sports

TI  - Planning the diffusion of a neck-injury prevention programme among community
      rugby union coaches.
PG  - 151-9
LID - 10.1136/bjsports-2012-091551 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This paper describes the development of a theory-informed and
      evidence-informed, context-specific diffusion plan for the Mayday Safety
      Procedure (MSP) among community rugby coaches in regional New South Wales,
      Australia. METHODS: Step 5 of Intervention Mapping was used to plan strategies to
      enhance MSP adoption and implementation. RESULTS: Coaches were identified as the 
      primary MSP adopters and implementers within a system including administrators,
      players and referees. A local advisory group was established to ensure context
      relevance. Performance objectives (eg, attend MSP training for coaches) and
      determinants of adoption and implementation behaviour (eg, knowledge, beliefs,
      skills and environment) were identified, informed by Social Cognitive Theory.
      Adoption and implementation matrices were developed and change-objectives for
      coaches were identified (eg, skills to deliver MSP training to players). Finally,
      intervention methods and specific strategies (eg, coach education, social
      marketing and policy and by-law development) were identified based on advisory
      group member experience, evidence of effective coach safety behaviour-change
      interventions and Diffusion of Innovations theory. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first
      published example of a systematic approach to plan injury prevention programme
      diffusion in community sports. The key strengths of this approach were an
      effective researcher-practitioner partnership; actively engaging local sports
      administrators; targeting specific behaviour determinants, informed by theory and
      evidence; and taking context-related practical strengths and constraints into
      consideration. The major challenges were the time involved in using a systematic 
      diffusion planning approach for the first time; and finding a planning language
      that was acceptable and meaningful to researchers and practitioners.

AB  - This review article provides an overview of the evidence that links exercise and 
      sports participation to physical and psychological well-being among people with
      spinal cord injury. Two aspects of physical well-being are examined, including
      the prevention of chronic disease and the promotion of physical fitness. Multiple
      aspects of psychosocial well-being are discussed, including mental health, social
      participation, and life satisfaction. The review concludes with future research
      recommendations and a discussion of challenges and opportunities for using
      exercise and sports to promote health and well-being among people living with
      spinal cord injury.

AB  - Competitive sports for people with disabilities has grown rapidly over the past
      several decades, and opportunities for participation are increasingly available
      throughout the spectrum from developmental to elite. The Paralympic Games, seen
      as the pinnacle sporting event that represents the broader Paralympic Movement,
      has provided a platform to showcase the abilities of people with disabilities
      while also serving as a catalyst for disability rights through ensuring
      integration, equality of opportunity, and accessibility of the built environment.
      Concurrently, media coverage of the Paralympic Games has led to an increased
      awareness of opportunities for sport participation for individuals with
      disabilities and, with it, the adjustment of norms regarding expectations for
      exercise as a component of preventive health. In addition, there is evidence of
      the power of sports to stimulate confidence, self-efficacy, and a self-perceived 
      high quality of life for individuals with disabilities above and beyond the basic
      benefits to cardiometabolic fitness. When taken together, the promotion of
      health, disability rights, and social integration through sports has the power to
      transform the lives of those who participate and to further stimulate the
      expansion of opportunities available to the next generation of athletes with
      disabilities.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article was to explore the differences in
      practice injury rates for select National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) 
      sports within and across sport by preseason, in-season, and postseason. This
      article will explore the relationship of practice injury rates by fall, winter,
      and spring sports as well as by Divisions I, II, and III. DESIGN: Descriptive
      epidemiology study. SETTING: NCAA schools. PATIENTS: NCAA athletes. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: Injury. RESULTS: In all sports across all seasons, preseason practice
      injury rates [6.3 per 1000 athletic exposure (A-E)] were higher than in-season
      (2.3 per 1000 A-E). Fall sports had an overall preseason practice injury rate of 
      7.4 (per 1000 A-E) compared with 7.0 (per 1000 A-E) for winter and 3.5 (per 1000 
      A-E) for spring sports. Women's soccer had the highest preseason injury rate of
      9.5 (per 1000 A-E). Men's football had the highest increased risk of injury
      comparing preseason with in-season practice injury (3.47 per 1000 A-E).
      CONCLUSIONS: The recognition that preseason practice injury rates are higher
      compared with in-season and postseason practice injury rates can create an
      opportunity for athletes, coaches, and medical personnel to identify prevention
      strategies to reduce preseason injury risk.

      adolescent girls.
PG  - 721-31
LID - 10.1177/1524839912464229 [doi]
AB  - The engagement of adolescent girls in physical activity (PA) is a persistent
      challenge. School-based PA programs have often met with little success because of
      the lack of linkages between school and community PA settings. The Triple G
      program aimed to improve PA levels of secondary school girls (12-15 years) in
      regional Victoria, Australia. The program included a school-based physical
      education (PE) component that uniquely incorporated student-centered teaching and
      behavioral skill development. The school component was conceptually and
      practically linked to a community component that emphasized appropriate
      structures for participation. The program was informed by ethnographic fieldwork 
      to understand the contextual factors that affect girls' participation in PA. A
      collaborative intervention design was undertaken to align with PE curriculum and 
      coaching and instructional approaches in community PA settings. The theoretical
      framework for the intervention was the socioecological model that was underpinned
      by both individual-level (social cognitive theory) and organizational-level
      (building organizational/community capacity) strategies. The program model
      provides an innovative conceptual framework for linking school PE with community 
      sport and recreation and may benefit other PA programs seeking to engage
      adolescent girls. The objective of this article is to describe program
      development and the unique theoretical framework and curriculum approaches.

TI  - Quality of life, coach behaviour and competitive anxiety in Winter Youth Olympic 
      Games participants.
PG  - 1044-7
LID - 10.1136/bjsports-2012-091539 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To ensure the highest technical performance, speed, safety, excellent
      control and to improve competitive performance, a successful regulation of
      competitive anxiety is necessary. Therefore, it seems crucial to identify factors
      influencing competitive anxiety of adolescent athletes. Research suggests that
      people reporting high quality of life are more capable to cope with stressful and
      challenging situations than others. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
      impact of quality of life, the involvement of parents in sports career and
      coach's leadership behaviour on competitive anxiety in Winter Youth Olympic Games
      participants. METHODS: During the first Winter Youth Olympic Games 2012 in
      Innsbruck/Austria, 662 (316 women) participants completed questionnaires and
      single items to assess quality of life, coach's leadership behaviour, parental
      involvement in sports career and competitive anxiety. RESULTS: Multiple
      regression analysis revealed positive influences of high quality of life and
      useful coach instruction on competitive anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship
      between quality of life, coach behaviour and competitive anxiety in young elite
      athletes competing at the first Winter Youth Olympic Games should be considered
      in long-term programmes for reducing competitive stress.

AB  - The study investigated the effects of a Special Olympics (SO) Unified Sport (UNS)
      soccer program on anthropometry, physical fitness and soccer skills of male youth
      athletes with and without intellectual disabilities (ID) who participated in a
      training group (TRG) and in a comparison group (CG) without specific training.
      Youth with ID (WID) were randomly selected out of all the students between the
      ages 12 and 15, with a diagnosis of educable mental retardation and no secondary 
      disabilities, who were attending a special education school. Participants without
      ID (WoID) were randomly selected from a regular secondary school out of the same 
      age groups of male students. All participants were given permission by their
      parents or guardians to participate in the study. Participants in the TRG
      included 23 youth WID and 23 youth WoID. Mean ages were = 14.1 (SD = 1.1) and
      13.2 (SD = 0.79) respectively. Fifteen WID, and 15 WoID comprised the CG. Mean
      ages were 14.51 (SD = 0.81) and 13.78 (SD = 0.49) respectively. Prior to and
      following the program measurements were conducted, and data were collected on
      students' anthropometric and fitness components of the Brockport physical fitness
      test as well as a soccer skill performance based on the SO soccer skill test.
      Participants in the TRG trained 8 weeks, 1.5h per session, three times per week, 
      in an after-school soccer program. CG did not participate in any sports program
      outside of the school physical education class. Dependent t tests and effect size
      calculations revealed that SO athletes and non-disabled partners scored
      significantly higher with regard to physical fitness and football skills in most 
      variables compared with their CG. This Unified Program was successful in
      increasing fitness and soccer skill performance of youth WID as well as of those 
      WoID.

TI  - Are current coaching recommendations for cricket batting technique supported by
      biomechanical research?
PG  - 311-23
AB  - Coaching manuals are an invaluable tool for coaches, used in player skill and
      technique development, especially at grass-roots level. Commonly developed by
      former players and coaches, this information is generally based on anecdotal
      evidence and in general lacks the scientific rigour of a peer-reviewed journal.
      Thus there is a need to establish the level of agreement and support between the 
      coaching and biomechanical literature. In doing so, evidence-based coaching
      practices can be optimally developed. Moreover, this will ensure the technique
      and skill development practices implemented at grass-roots level are supported by
      successful performance in the later stages of player development. The purpose of 
      this review was to evaluate the latest batting biomechanics research, providing a
      comprehensive and up-to-date insight into the kinematic and kinetic aspects of
      batting in cricket. Furthermore, this review compared and contrasted this
      research with a selection of coaching literature, establishing a strong level of 
      support and agreement between the coaching and biomechanical literature in
      recommendations for cricket batting technique. Although the ambiguity in a number
      of coaching concepts still exists, coaches and players can be confident in the
      successful implementation of both sources of information in a player's technical 
      development.

TI  - Returning to sports after total joint replacements and tibial osteotomies: is it 
      possible?
PG  - 483-5
AB  - Total joint replacement and tibial osteotomies have been used for decades to
      return the individual to activities and relieve pain. According to the American
      Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, joint replacement is considered one of the most 
      successful medical innovations of the 20th century. Hip and knee-replacement
      operations are increasing in frequency and are continuing to achieve pain relief 
      and improve function for patients with arthritic joints. Demand for knee
      replacement is expected to double over the next five to 10 years and for hip
      replacement, it is expected to double over the next 10 to 15 years. The trend for
      joint replacement has begun to include the younger as well as the older still
      active individual. Younger patients are considering joint-replacement surgery
      earlier in life due to advances in surgery and devices. Since children begin
      sports at a fairly early age, once they reach young adulthood, their joints have 
      sustained recurrent internal impact for many years leading to degeneration
      earlier in life. These younger patients are expecting and choosing to participate
      in sports even after surgery. They want to be able to coach and play sports with 
      their children without pain. While pain relief has historically been the main
      reason people have joint replacement surgery--the need to improve joint-function 
      has also become motivating for patients--especially those involved in athletic
      activities. Patients and orthopedic surgeons do not necessarily worry about the
      same things after joint-replacement surgery.

TI  - High school coaches perceptions of physicians' role in the assessment and
      management of sports-related concussive injury.
PG  - 130
LID - 10.3389/fneur.2012.00130 [doi]
AB  - Sports concussions are an increasingly recognized common type of mild traumatic
      brain injury (TBI) that affect athletes of all ages. The need for an increased
      involvement of trained physicians in the diagnosis and treatment of concussion
      has become more obvious as the pathophysiology and long-term sequelae of sports
      concussion are better understood. To date, there has been great variability in
      the athletic community about the recognition of symptoms, diagnosis, management, 
      and physician role in concussion care. An awareness assessment survey
      administered to 96 high school coaches in a large metropolitan city demonstrated 
      that 37.5% of responders refer their concussed players to an emergency department
      after the incident, only 39.5% of responders have a physician available to
      evaluate their players after a concussion, 71.6% of those who had a physician
      available sent their players to a sports medicine physician, and none of the
      responders had their player's concussion evaluated by a neurologist.
      Interestingly, 71.8% of responders stated that their players returned to the team
      with "return to play" guidelines from their physician. This survey has
      highlighted two important areas where the medical community can better serve the 
      athletic community. Because a concussion is a sport-inflicted injury to the
      nervous system, it is optimally evaluated and managed by a clinician with
      relevant training in both clinical neuroscience and sports medicine. Furthermore,
      all physicians who see patients suffering concussion should be educated in the
      current recommendations from the Consensus Statement on Concussion and provide
      return to play instructions that outline a graduated return to play, allowing the
      athlete to return to the field safely.

LID - 10.1097/MOP.0b013e3283595175 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sport-related concussion affects athletes at every level of
      participation. The short and long-term effects of concussions that occur during
      childhood and adolescence are not fully understood. The purpose of this review is
      to describe the current burden of disease, current practice patterns and current 
      recommendations for the assessment and management of sport-related concussions
      sustained by United States high school athletes. RECENT FINDINGS: Millions of
      high school students participate in organized sports in the United States.
      Current estimates suggest that, across all sports, approximately 2.5 concussions 
      occur for every 10 000 athletic exposures, in which an athletic exposure is
      defined as one athlete participating in one game or practice. At schools that
      employ at least one athletic trainer, most high school athletes who sustain
      sport-related concussions will be cared for by athletic trainers and primary care
      physicians. Approximately 40% will undergo computerized neurocognitive
      assessment. SUMMARY: The number of high school athletes being diagnosed with
      sport-related concussions is rising. American football has the highest number of 
      concussions in high school with girls' soccer having the second highest total
      number. Fortunately, coaches are becoming increasingly aware of these injuries
      and return-to-play guidelines are being implemented.

TI  - Transcontextual development of motivation in sport injury prevention among elite 
      athletes.
PG  - 661-82
AB  - The present study investigated the transcontextual process of motivation in sport
      injury prevention. We examined whether general causality orientation, perceived
      autonomy support from coaches (PAS), self-determined motivation (SD-Mtv), and
      basic need satisfaction in a sport context predicted SD-Mtv, beliefs, and
      adherence with respect to sport injury prevention. Elite athletes (N = 533)
      completed self-report measures of the predictors (Week 1) and the dependent
      variables (Week 2). Variance-based structural equation modeling supported
      hypotheses: SD-Mtv in a sport context was significantly predicted by PAS and
      basic need satisfaction and was positively associated with SD-Mtv for sport
      injury prevention when controlling for general causality orientation. SD-Mtv for 
      sport injury prevention was a significant predictor of adherence to
      injury-preventive behaviors and beliefs regarding safety in sport. In conclusion,
      the transcontextual mechanism of motivation may explain the process by which
      distal motivational factors in sport direct the formation of proximal motivation,
      beliefs, and behaviors of sport injury prevention.

AB  - Coaches are central to talent development in youth soccer and what they say and
      do impacts on players' achievements and well-being. Researchers have
      systematically observed coach behaviour and practice activities within this
      setting (i.e. 'what coaches do'). We review this research in light of
      contemporary discussion that highlights a potential 'theory-practice' divide. Our
      main example focuses on the discrepancy between coaching behaviour and research
      from the sports science sub-discipline areas of motor learning and skill
      acquisition that relate to how best to design practice sessions and provide
      instruction (i.e., 'what coaches should probably do'). The underlying reasons for
      this discrepancy are discussed and recommendations made to address this disparity
      in research, education and coach behaviours.

TI  - Clinical Outcomes and Return-to-Sports Participation of 50 Soccer Players After
      Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Through a Sport-Specific Rehabilitation
      Protocol.
PG  - 17-24
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rehabilitation of soccer players after anterior cruciate ligament
      reconstruction is usually performed without sport-specific guidelines, and the
      final phases are often left to the team coaches. The possibility of changing this
      approach has not yet been investigated. STUDY DESIGN: Case series. HYPOTHESIS: A 
      specific rehabilitation protocol for soccer players, with direct control of the
      last on-field rehabilitation phases, may lead to complete functional recovery.
      METHODS: Fifty competitive soccer players who followed a sport-specific
      rehabilitation protocol for soccer were evaluated during the recovery period
      until their return to competition. The assessment of the functional outcomes was 
      performed using the Knee Outcome Survey-Sports Activity Scale and isokinetic and 
      aerobic fitness tests. RESULTS: The average start of on-field rehabilitation was 
      90 +/- 26 days after surgery; the average time to return to the competitions was 
      185 +/- 52 days. The improvement in the Knee Outcome Survey-Sports Activity Scale
      during on-field rehabilitation was significant (P < 0.01; from 79 +/- 15% to 96
      +/- 7%). The isokinetic and aerobic fitness tests showed a significant
      improvement of muscle strength (knee extensors, +55%, P < 0.01; knee flexors,
      +86%, P < 0.01) and aerobic threshold (+23%, P < 0.01) from the beginning to the 
      end of on-field rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: Adding on-field rehabilitation to
      the traditional protocols after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction may
      safely lead to complete functional recovery in soccer players.

TI  - Growth hormone deficiency due to sports-related head trauma is associated with
      impaired cognitive performance in amateur boxers and kickboxers as revealed by
      P300 auditory event-related potentials.
PG  - 730-7
LID - 10.1111/cen.12037 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: It has been recently reported that boxing and kickboxing may cause
      pituitary dysfunction, GH deficiency in particular. The strong link between poor 
      cognitive performance and GH deficiency due to causes other than head trauma and 
      the improvement of cognitive function after GH replacement therapy have been
      previously shown. P300 auditory event-related potential (ERP) measure is widely
      used to evaluate cognitive performance. In this study, we investigated the
      relation between the GH-IGF-I axis and cognitive performance in boxers and
      kickboxers. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Forty-one actively competing or retired male
      boxers (n: 27) and kickboxers (n: 14) with a mean age of 29.04 +/- 9.30 year and 
      14 age- and education-matched healthy male controls were included in the study.
      For neuropsychological tests, the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and
      Quality of Life Assessment of GH Deficiency in Adults (QoL-AGHDA) questionnaires 
      were administered. Moreover, cognitive performance was evaluated according to
      P300 ERPs. RESULTS: Nine of 41 (21.9%) athletes had GH deficiency. P300
      amplitudes were lower at all electrode sites in the GH-deficient group than in
      controls, and the differences were statistically significant at Fz and Oz
      electrode sites (P < 0.05). When GH-deficient athletes were compared with
      GH-sufficient athletes, the P300 amplitudes were lower at all electrode sites in 
      the GH-deficient group; these differences were statistically significant at Fz,
      Pz and Cz electrode sites (P < 0.05). In all athletes, there were significant
      negative correlations between IGF-I levels vs P300 latencies, and there were
      significant positive correlations between IGF-I levels vs P300 amplitudes (P <
      0.05). CONCLUSION: This study provides the first electrophysiological evidence
      for the close relation between the P300 ERPs and the GH-IGF-I axis in boxers and 
      kickboxers.

TI  - A job analysis of major college female strength and conditioning coaches.
PG  - 2000-12
LID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e31827361a9 [doi]
AB  - This investigation consisted of a job analysis of 6 National Collegiate Athletic 
      Association (NCAA) Division I female strength and conditioning coaches. Each
      coach was employed at universities competing within the Football Bowl
      Subdivision. All subjects in the survey were responsible for providing strength
      and conditioning services to their institution's athletic programs. The
      procedures used for the gathering of data involved a questionnaire followed by a 
      semi-structured interview. The purpose of this format was to use the
      semi-structured interview to delve more deeply into the issues raised by the
      questionnaire. Evidence was obtained related to demographic data; major job
      duties; relationships with supervisors, fellow strength coaches, and the sport
      coaches with whom they work; and the effects the job has on their spouse and
      other family members. All the participants in the study were white with an
      average age of 31.6 years. Their average time spent in the profession was 8
      years, and the average time spent in their current employment was 5 years.
      Overall, the job satisfaction for the group was high. Five of the subjects held
      master's degrees, and all participants held relevant certifications in the field.
      The coaches primarily provided services to athletes participating in women's
      sports at their respective universities.

TI  - Effect of high-speed treadmill training with a body weight support system in a
      sport acceleration program with female soccer players.
PG  - 1496-502
LID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e31826cac04 [doi]
AB  - Maximum running speed and acceleration are essential components in many sports.
      The identification of specific training protocols to maximize sprint speed would 
      be useful knowledge for coaches and players. The purpose of this study was to
      determine the effect of a high-speed treadmill (HST) with the use of a body
      weight support (BWS) system in a 6-week sport acceleration program (SAP) on
      female soccer athlete's 40-yard sprint time and maximal isometric knee flexor and
      extensor strength. Two treatment groups and one control group were created. Both 
      treatment groups participated in a 12-session SAP. The first treatment group (n =
      12) used a BWS system while running on a HST; the second group (n = 12) used a
      standard treadmill (ST) with no BWS system. The participants of the control group
      (n = 8), NT, did not participate in a sports acceleration program and did not
      alter their exercise routines outside of the study. An analysis of covariance was
      performed using baseline measures as the covariate. The 40-yard sprint times for 
      both treatment groups were shown to improve significantly compared with the
      control group (p < 0.001). Isometric knee flexor strength showed a greater
      increase in the ST group (p = 0.026) than in the other 2 groups, whereas knee
      extensor strengths did not show significant differences between treatment groups 
      and control group (p > 0.05). Participants in the ST group had a much higher rate
      (66%) of shin splints and foot pain throughout the study than those in the HST
      (8%) and NT (0%) groups. These results can help high school coaches and athletes 
      determine the optimal treadmill training regime.

TI  - Can reputation biases influence the outcome and process of making competence
      judgments of a coach?
PG  - e65-73
LID - 10.1111/sms.12000 [doi]
AB  - The present studies explored the effect of reputational biases on judgments made 
      of coach competence and the visual search patterns adopted by individuals when
      generating initial impressions and expectations of a target. In study 1,
      participants (n = 326) observed footage of two coaches prior to making competence
      judgments of them. All participants viewed similar footage for the first coach
      (control) but reputational information was manipulated for the second coach
      (target). In study 2, participants (n = 22) followed the same procedure as study 
      1 but also wore a head-mounted eye-tracking system to enable visual search data
      to be collected. Study 1 broadly reported coaches with a "professional"
      reputation to be judged as being significantly more competent across varying
      competence measures compared to coaches with either an "in-training" reputation
      or "no reputation." Study 2 indicated limited differences across the reputational
      conditions in relation to visual fixations. The data indicate that expectations
      of coach competence can be influenced, and largely controlled, by the
      reputational information provided to athletes. While there were limited
      differences in visual search strategies across reputation conditions, suggestions
      for research are made to enable a fuller insight to the interpersonal
      interactions that may facilitate the working association between athletes and
      coaches.

      sports participation in the UK.
PG  - 87-96

AB  - Whether young people should specialise in one competitive sport at an early age, 
      or pursue a wider range of sports during adolescence is a topic of some debate
      (Baker, Cobley, & Fraser-Thomas, 2009) and is fundamental within sports policy
      and coaching practice. The purpose of this retrospective recall study was to
      identify whether early specialisation or sporting diversification (sampling)
      throughout childhood and adolescence can influence performance levels prior to
      adulthood. An online questionnaire was used to collect the sport participation
      histories of 1006 UK sports people, which were then compared with the
      developmental framework provided by the Developmental Model of Sport
      Participation (DMSP, Cote & Fraser-Thomas, 2007). A significant association
      between the number of sports participated in at the ages of 11, 13, and 15 and
      the standard of competition between 16 and 18 years was found. Individuals who
      competed in three sports aged 11, 13, and 15 were significantly more likely to
      compete at a national compared with club standard between the ages of 16 and 18
      than those who practised only one sport. The findings reported here provide some 
      empirical support for the sampling performance pathway DMSP model in a UK
      context.

AB  - The study examined the independent and combined effects of coach leadership and
      coaching relationships on team efficacy. A total of 150 sport performers from
      football teams across a range of competitive levels completed a multisection
      self-report instrument to assess their individual perceptions of the level of
      collective efficacy, the type of coach leadership, and the quality of the
      coach-athlete relationship. Multiple regression analyses revealed that
      perceptions of both coach leadership and the coach-athlete relationship predicted
      variance in team efficacy. Overall, the findings suggest that the quality of
      coach-athlete relationships added to the prediction of individuals' collective
      efficacy beyond what was predicted by coaches' behaviors of leadership alone.
      Limitations and future research directions are discussed.

TI  - Eight clinical conundrums relating to anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury in 
      sport: recent evidence and a personal reflection.
PG  - 367-72
LID - 10.1136/bjsports-2012-091623 [doi]
AB  - Over two million anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries occur worldwide
      annually, and the greater prevalence for ACL injury in young female athletes is
      one of the major problems in sports medicine. Optimal treatment of ACL injury
      requires individualised management. Patient selection is of utmost importance,
      and so is respect for the patient's functional demands and interests. All
      patients with an ACL tear may not need surgery, however athletes and persons with
      an active lifestyle with high knee functional demands including cutting motions
      need and should be offered surgery. In many cases it may not be the choice of
      graft or technique that is the key for success, but the choice of surgeon. The
      surgeon should be experienced and use a reconstructive procedure he/she knows
      very well and is comfortable with. The development of osteoarthritis after an ACL
      injury depends very much on the injury mechanism and concurrent meniscal injury, 
      as knee articular cartilage continues to heal for 1-2 years after an ACL injury. 
      Therefore the surgeon and rehabilitation team must pay attention to the
      rehabilitation process and to the decision when to return to sport. Return to
      sport must be carefully considered, as top-level sport in itself is one main risk
      factor for osteoarthritis after ACL injury. The present criteria for return to
      sport need to be revisited, also due to the fact that recurrent injury seems to
      be an increasing problem. ACL injury prevention programmes are now available in
      some sports. The key issue for a prevention programme to be successful is proper 
      implementation. Vital factors for success include the individual coaching of the 
      player and well controlled compliance with the training programme. Preventive
      activities should be more actively supported by the involved athletic community. 
      Despite substantial advances in the field of ACL injury over the past 40 years,
      substantial management challenges remain.

TI  - [Diet supplements in nutrition of sport mastery school students].
PG  - 193-8
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In Polish society, for some time now, a growing interest in
      supplementation of the diet has been observed. This problem addresses
      particularly to sportsmen and physically active persons. It is often due to
      belief that customary diet does not supply organism with necessary food
      ingredients. There are also some threats connected with supplementation of the
      diet. Problems addressed to supplementation of the diet are particularly
      important for young sportsmen, including students of sport mastery schools.
      OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was the evaluation of the diet supplementation
      used by the students of sport mastery school in Western Pomeranian district.
      MATERIAL AND METHOD: The study was carried out in the group of 76 students, aged 
      15 to 19, practicing walleyball (girls n = 39) and football (boys n = 37) at the 
      sport mastery school in Police (western Pomeranian district). The interview
      method has been applied. A significance of differences, for the analysed factor, 
      due to a sport discipline practiced was calculated based on Chi2 (Statistica 9). 
      RESULTS: The results of the study confirmed the students of sport mastery school 
      to supplement their diets. The diet supplementation being more frequent for boys 
      (67.6%) with magnesium (57-64%) noted as the most frequently used supplement,
      followed with vitamin-mineral agents and L-carnitine. Essential differences were 
      noted for reasons of diet supplementation and sources of information used on
      supplements between the sport disciplines practiced. CONCLUSIONS: It can be
      stated, based on the obtained results, that for supplementation of the diet among
      students of sport mastery school in Police is popular, even though there was no
      previous recognition of its necessity. The most frequent supplements users were
      football players with magnesium being the most frequently chosen supplement.
      Based on the above a regular training of sportsmen, including also coaches
      training young people, on the rational feeding habits would be advisable.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the careers of two successful female elite
      athletes who later stagnated, and to identify possible factors that might have
      led to their demotivation. Individual interviews and a focus group interview were
      conducted. Using a multidisciplinary approach, the stories of April and Hazel
      raised several issues related to coaching, coach education, and the development
      of female athletes. Their individual profiles revealed that their perception of
      the lack of long-term development was caused by coach miscommunication, having to
      cope with sudden fame, and injuries provoked by overtraining. The coach-athlete
      relationship was discussed with a focus on the inexperience of some coaches, the 
      number of coaches the athletes had to deal with, sociolinguistic issues, and the 
      differing criteria of success communicated. Finally, the importance of their
      national governing bodies to focus on knowledge transfer, the supervision of
      coaches, and the infrastructure to monitor athletes were discussed.

TI  - Functional improvement and social participation through sports activity for
      children with mental retardation: a field study from a developing nation.
PG  - 339-47
LID - 10.1177/0309364612451206 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: While the positive effect of sports and exercise on physical and
      psychological well being is well documented within the general population, the
      effects of sports on the functional ability of a child with mental retardation
      are limited. OBJECTIVES: To determine if sports activities have been detrimental 
      in improving functional ability in sample of children with mental retardation
      based in Kolkata, a metropolis in India. STUDY DESIGN: Field level study.
      METHODS: Six sports associations registered under the Sports Authority of India
      for training children with mental retardation were shortlisted on the basis of
      four criteria. From the register, every third name (gender irrespective)
      belonging to the second (12-15 years) and third (15-21 years) subclasses (out of 
      the four categories laid down in the Special Olympics participation rules)
      against a constraint of at least two years active attendance in the sports
      facility for the child was selected. A sample of 31 children was drawn and the
      WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0) 12-item version was
      administered to the caregiver-teacher-coach team of the sample. Relative changes 
      in scores between the point when the survey was conducted and the point when the 
      child joined the sports facility was used as the dependent variable for
      regression analysis. The number of years in active sports, in school age of the
      respondent and base score of the children when they joined school were the
      independent variables. RESULTS: For seven of the WHODAS 2.0 12-item attributes,
      the number of years in sports activities was found to have a statistically
      significant effect (p < 0.01) on the functional well being of children with mild 
      to moderate mental retardation. The number of years in school was also another
      statistically significant factor (p < 0.01) responsible for this improvement. The
      children, however, perceived of being not welcome in community activities, but
      participated in activities meant exclusively for them. CONCLUSIONS: This small
      study showed that the proposition that number of years in sports activities was a
      significant factor responsible for improving the functioning of children with
      mild to moderate mental retardation.

TI  - Should preparation for elite sporting participation be included in the
      rehabilitation process of war-injured veterans?
PG  - 270-7
LID - 10.1177/0309364612447096 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Participation in sport and exercise training, while aiding in the
      reintegration and confidence building of wounded service personnel, also has
      potential to prepare them for elite sport competition. It is this encouragement
      of the war injured to use sport and recreational physical activity as a means of 
      rehabilitation back into civilian life, which has become the worldwide phenomenon
      of Paralympic sport. OBJECTIVES: This paper evaluates existing research relating 
      to the incidence of types of war injuries and the use of sport within the
      rehabilitation process. STUDY DESIGN: Literature review. METHODS: Initial
      searches were conducted in the electronic databases EBSCOHost, ScienceDirect and 
      Pubmed using the keywords 'veterans' and 'sport' or 'physical activity'. These
      searches were then supplemented by tracking all key references from the
      appropriate articles identified. A narrative literature review methodology was
      employed. RESULTS: Although it is clear from the reported literature that further
      development of available rehabilitation services is necessary to provide the
      required level of care for the types of mental and physical injuries and the
      concept of 'therapeutic recreation' is becoming popular, there is still a need
      for the development of specific protocols to identify individuals who can
      participate and excel in a specific sport at an elite level. CONCLUSIONS: Drawing
      on the US military experience it can be argued that sport in the UK and other
      parts of the world should be more widely recognized as a component of
      rehabilitation. This is not just for the role that sport can play as a tool for
      rehabilitation but also for the intrinsic and extrinsic benefits that
      participation in elite sport can offer.

TI  - Which screening tools can predict injury to the lower extremities in team
      sports?: a systematic review.
PG  - 791-815
LID - 10.2165/11632730-000000000-00000 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Injuries to lower extremities are common in team sports such as
      soccer, basketball, volleyball, football and field hockey. Considering personal
      grief, disabling consequences and high costs caused by injuries to lower
      extremities, the importance for the prevention of these injuries is evident. From
      this point of view it is important to know which screening tools can identify
      athletes who are at risk of injury to their lower extremities. OBJECTIVE: The aim
      of this article is to determine the predictive values of anthropometric and/or
      physical screening tests for injuries to the leg, anterior cruciate ligament
      (ACL), knee, hamstring, groin and ankle in team sports. METHODS: A systematic
      review was conducted in MEDLINE (1966 to September 2011), EMBASE (1989 to
      September 2011) and CINAHL (1982 to September 2011). Based on inclusion criteria 
      defined a priori, titles, abstracts and full texts were analysed to find relevant
      studies. RESULTS: The analysis showed that different screening tools can be
      predictive for injuries to the knee, ACL, hamstring, groin and ankle. For
      injuries in general there is some support in the literature to suggest that
      general joint laxity is a predictive measure for leg injuries. The anterior
      right/left reach distance >4 cm and the composite reach distance <4.0% of limb
      length in girls measured with the star excursion balance test (SEBT) may predict 
      leg injuries. Furthermore, an increasing age, a lower hamstring/quadriceps (H :
      Q) ratio and a decreased range of motion (ROM) of hip abduction may predict the
      occurrence of leg injuries. Hyperextension of the knee, side-to-side differences 
      in anterior-posterior knee laxity and differences in knee abduction moment
      between both legs are suggested to be predictive tests for sustaining an ACL
      injury and height was a predictive screening tool for knee ligament injuries.
      There is some evidence that when age increases, the probability of sustaining a
      hamstring injury increases. Debate exists in the analysed literature regarding
      measurement of the flexibility of the hamstring as a predictive screening tool,
      as well as using the H : Q ratio. Hip-adduction-to-abduction strength is a
      predictive test for hip adductor muscle strain. Studies do not agree on whether
      ROM of the hamstring is a predictive screening tool for groin injury. Body mass
      index and the age of an athlete could contribute to an ankle sprain. There is
      support in the literature to suggest that greater strength of the plantar flexors
      may be a predictive measure for sustaining an ankle injury. Furthermore, there is
      some agreement that the measurement of postural sway is a predictive test for an 
      ankle injury. CONCLUSIONS: The screening tools mentioned above can be recommended
      to medical staff and coaches for screening their athletes. Future research should
      focus on prospective studies in larger groups and should follow athletes over
      several seasons.

TI  - Comprehensive assessment and management of athletes with sport concussion.
PG  - 433-47
AB  - Currently, the popular approach to post-concussion management of the athlete
      relies upon the use of a multidisciplinary team of healthcare providers, all
      typically coordinated by a physician. That core team is often supplemented by
      nurses, psychotherapists, coaches, teachers, the athletic director, and, of
      course, family members. However, access to such a model is frequently limited by 
      financial, geographical, and numerous other factors. In the absence of such
      resources, a thorough clinical evaluation and management by an available, ongoing
      healthcare provider, quite often the sports physical therapist, becomes
      necessary.The authors recommend that the professional who coordinates the
      athlete's post-concussion healthcare should focus efforts upon a comprehensive
      assessment and tailored treatment plan specific to the athlete's post-concussive 
      symptoms. Assessment of both pre-morbid function and post-injury physical,
      cognitive, psychosocial, emotional, and behavioral issues, including the
      patient's support system, can assist the clinician with identifying specific
      constraints to sport, academic, social, and vocational activity participation.
      Hence, the assessment provides structure to the athlete's individualized
      treatment plan. Successful specialized interventions that address the
      multi-faceted impairments of sport related concussion frequently require
      knowledge of resources in a variety of other healthcare professions, in order to 
      facilitate appropriate and necessary treatment referrals.Initial assessment
      should be followed by repeat monitoring throughout treatment, and spanning a
      variety of environments, in order to ensure the athlete's full recovery prior to 
      return, not only to sport participation, but also to involvement in social,
      academic, and/or employment related life activities. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 5.

TI  - Antecedents of perceived coach interpersonal behaviors: the coaching environment 
      and coach psychological well- and ill-being.
PG  - 481-502
AB  - Embedded in the self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 2000) framework, we
      obtained self-report data from 418 paid and voluntary coaches from a variety of
      sports and competitive levels with the aim of exploring potential antecedents of 
      coaches' perceived autonomy supportive and controlling behaviors. Controlling for
      socially desirable responses, structural equation modeling revealed that greater 
      job security and opportunities for professional development, and lower work-life 
      conflict were associated with psychological need satisfaction, which, in turn,
      was related to an adaptive process of psychological well-being and perceived
      autonomy support toward athletes. In contrast, higher work-life conflict and
      fewer opportunities for development were associated with a distinct maladaptive
      process of thwarted psychological needs, psychological ill-being, and perceived
      controlling interpersonal behavior. The results highlight how the coaching
      context may impact upon coaches' psychological health and their interpersonal
      behavior toward athletes. Moreover, evidence is provided for the independence of 
      adaptive and maladaptive processes within the self-determination theory paradigm.

AB  - Laboratory medicine is complex and contributes to the diagnosis, therapeutic
      monitoring and follow-up of acquired and inherited human disorders. The regular
      practice of physical exercise provides important benefits in heath and disease
      and sports medicine is thereby receiving growing focus from almost each and every
      clinical discipline, including laboratory medicine. Sport-laboratory medicine is 
      a relatively innovative branch of laboratory science, which can provide valuable 
      contributions to the diagnosis and follow-up of athletic injuries, and which is
      acquiring a growing clinical significance to support biomechanics and identify
      novel genomics and "exercisenomics" patterns that can help identify specific
      athlete's tendency towards certain types of sport traumas and injuries.
      Laboratory medicine can also provide sport physicians and coaches with valuable
      clues about personal inclination towards a certain sport, health status, fitness 
      and nutritional deficiencies of professional, elite and recreational athletes in 
      order to enable a better and earlier prediction of sport injuries, overreaching
      and overtraining. Finally, the wide armamentarium of laboratory tests represents 
      the milestone for identifying cheating athletes in the strenuous fight against
      doping in sports.

TI  - Talent identification and specialization in sport: an overview of some unanswered
      questions.
PG  - 390-3
AB  - The theory of deliberate practice postulates that experts are always made, not
      born. This theory translated to the youth-sport domain means that if athletes
      want to be high-level performers, they need to deliberately engage in practice
      during the specialization years, spending time wisely and always focusing on
      tasks that challenge current performance. Sport organizations in several
      countries around the world created specialized training centers where selected
      young talents practice under the supervision of experienced coaches in order to
      become professional athletes and integrate onto youth national teams. Early
      specialization and accurate observation by expert coaches or scouts remain the
      only tools to find a potential excellent athlete among a great number of
      participants. In the current study, the authors present 2 of the problems raised 
      by talent search and the risks of such a search. Growth and maturation are
      important concepts to better understand the identification, selection, and
      development processes of young athletes. However, the literature suggests that
      sport-promoting strategies are being maintained despite the increased demands in 
      the anthropometric characteristics of professional players and demands of actual 
      professional soccer competitions. On the other hand, identifying biological
      variables that can predict performance is almost impossible.

AB  - A social networking Web site, Facebook, was used to deliver long-term sport
      psychology consultation services to student-athletes (i.e., soccer players) in
      30- to 60-min weekly sessions. Additional short-term team building, group
      cohesion, communication, anger management, injury rehabilitation, mental
      toughness, commitment, and leadership workshops were provided. Cohesion and
      overall relationships between both the student-athletes and the sport psychology 
      consultants benefited from this process. Social networking Web sites offer a
      practical way of providing sport psychology consulting services that does not
      require use of major resources.

TI  - Enhancing team-sport athlete performance: is altitude training relevant?
PG  - 751-67
LID - 10.2165/11634050-000000000-00000 [doi]
AB  - Field-based team sport matches are composed of short, high-intensity efforts,
      interspersed with intervals of rest or submaximal exercise, repeated over a
      period of 60-120 minutes. Matches may also be played at moderate altitude where
      the lower oxygen partial pressure exerts a detrimental effect on performance. To 
      enhance run-based performance, team-sport athletes use varied training strategies
      focusing on different aspects of team-sport physiology, including aerobic,
      sprint, repeated-sprint and resistance training. Interestingly, 'altitude'
      training (i.e. living and/or training in O(2)-reduced environments) has only been
      empirically employed by athletes and coaches to improve the basic characteristics
      of speed and endurance necessary to excel in team sports. Hypoxia, as an
      additional stimulus to training, is typically used by endurance athletes to
      enhance performance at sea level and to prepare for competition at altitude.
      Several approaches have evolved in the last few decades, which are known to
      enhance aerobic power and, thus, endurance performance. Altitude training can
      also promote an increased anaerobic fitness, and may enhance sprint capacity.
      Therefore, altitude training may confer potentially-beneficial adaptations to
      team-sport athletes, which have been overlooked in contemporary sport physiology 
      research. Here, we review the current knowledge on the established benefits of
      altitude training on physiological systems relevant to team-sport performance,
      and conclude that current evidence supports implementation of altitude training
      modalities to enhance match physical performances at both sea level and altitude.
      We hope that this will guide the practice of many athletes and stimulate future
      research to better refine training programmes.

TI  - Girls' physical activity levels during organized sports in Australia.
PG  - 116-22
LID - 10.1249/MSS.0b013e31826a0a73 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The primary aim of this study was to objectively examine the physical
      activity (PA) levels of girls during organized sports (OS) and to compare the
      levels between games and practices for the same participants. The secondary aims 
      of this study were to document lesson context and coach behavior during practices
      and games. METHODS: Participants were 94 girls recruited from 10 teams in three
      OS (netball, basketball, and soccer) from the western suburbs of Sydney. Each
      participant wore an ActiGraph GT3X monitor for the duration of one practice and
      one game. The System for Observing Fitness Instruction Time was concurrently used
      to document lesson context and coach behavior. RESULTS: Girls spent a
      significantly higher percentage of time in moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) during 
      practices compared with games (33.8% vs 30.6%; t = 2.94, P < 0.05). Girls spent
      approximately 20 min.h(-1) in MVPA during practices and approximately 18
      min.h(-1) in MVPA during games. An average of 2957 and 2702 steps per hour were
      accumulated during practices and games, respectively. However, girls spent
      roughly two-thirds of their OS time in light PA or sedentary. On the basis of the
      System for Observing Fitness Instruction Time findings, coaches spent a large
      proportion of practice time in management (15.0%) and knowledge delivery (18.5%).
      An average of 13.0 and 15.8 occurrences per hour were observed during games and
      practices where coaches promoted PA. CONCLUSIONS: For every hour of game play or 
      practice time, girls accumulated approximately one third of the recommended 60
      min of MVPA time and approximately one quarter of the 12,000 steps that girls are
      recommended to accumulate daily. For this population, OS seems to make a
      substantial contribution to the recommended amounts of MVPA and steps for
      participating girls. OS alone, however, does not provide amounts of PA sufficient
      to meet daily recommendations for adolescent girls.

PG  - 1423-34
LID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e318267a214 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to explore the career experiences of
      Australian strength and conditioning coaches. Six Australian strength and
      conditioning coaches (mean age = 33.7 years, SD = 6.0 years) with a mean of 10.4 
      (SD = 4.9) years experience working with elite Olympic and professional athletes 
      were interviewed about their experiences of career development. Each interview
      was transcribed verbatim and analyzed to produce key themes and subthemes
      relating to (a) work environments, (b) sport management practice, (c) career
      development processes, and (d) career building strategies. The work environments 
      of Australian strength and conditioning coaches were found to be poor because of 
      long working hours and irregular human resource policy and management practices
      of sport organizations. Because of the volatile and unpredictable nature of their
      working conditions, the coaches interviewed have only a short-term view of their 
      career creating considerable stress in their lives. The coaches interviewed found
      it difficult to develop their careers because their only options were
      self-supported and self-funded professional development activities. The coaches
      in this study believed that more needed to be done at a policy and management
      level by sport organizations and their professional body to enhance the career
      development of strength and conditioning coaches because they play a key role in 
      both athlete and sport organization performance. These results may help sport
      organizations develop policies and management practices that enhance the careers 
      of strength and conditioning coaches and will have important practical
      implications for the education and development of sport professionals.

      for sport and active recreation related orthopaedic injury.
PG  - 377-84
LID - 10.1136/injuryprev-2011-040190 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hospitalised sport and active recreation injuries can have serious
      long-term consequences. Despite this, few studies have examined the long-term
      outcomes of these injuries. The purpose of this study was to establish whether
      patients hospitalised with orthopaedic sport and active recreation injuries, have
      returned to their pre-injury levels of health status and function, 12 months post
      injury and identify factors associated with poor outcomes. The present work was a
      cohort study with retrospective assessment of pre-injury status and prospective
      assessment of outcome at 12 months post injury. METHODS: Adults with orthopaedic 
      sport and active recreation injuries, captured by the Victorian Orthopaedic
      Trauma Outcomes Registry were recruited to the study. Pre-injury and 12-month
      outcomes were assessed using the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and the
      extended Glasgow Outcome Scale. Differences in pre-injury and post-injury SF-36
      scores were examined and demographic, injury, hospital and physical activity
      variables were assessed for associations with outcome using multivariate linear
      regression. RESULTS: Of the 324 participants 98% were followed-up at 12 months
      post injury. At 12 months, participants reported a mean 7.0-point reduction in
      physical health (95% CI 5.8 to 7.8) and a 2.5-point reduction in mental health
      (95% CI 1.2 to 3.0), with 58% (95% CI 52.6% to 63.4%) reporting reduced function.
      Sporting group (p=0.001), Injury Severity Score >15 (p=0.007) and high pre-injury
      vigorous activity levels (p=0.04), were related to poorer physical health
      outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: At 12 months post injury, most participants reported large
      reductions in physical health and reduced function. This information is important
      for furthering our understanding of the burden of sport and active recreation
      injury and setting priorities for treatment and rehabilitation.

TI  - Achieving optimum sports performance during Ramadan: some practical
      recommendations.
PG  - S109-17

AB  - Muslim athletes should fast from sunrise to sunset each day throughout the 30
      days of Ramadan. Most athletes will continue to train throughout Ramadan, and
      they may also be required to compete at this time, but they will also engage in
      the religious, cultural, and social activities that Ramadan represents. The
      available evidence indicates that high-level athletes can maintain performance
      during Ramadan if physical training, food and fluid intake, and sleep are
      appropriate and well controlled. Individualized monitoring of athletes may help
      to prevent fatigue and overtraining and to reduce the risk of consequent illness 
      and injury. The timing and intensity of training may require adjustment to
      optimize the training response, and training close to or after sunset may have
      advantages, but this will vary between individual and team sports and between
      environments that are predominantly Muslim and those that are predominantly
      non-Muslim. Training late in the day allows nutrition interventions after
      training to promote adaptations to the training stimulus, to promote recovery,
      and might help to reduce muscle damage. Sleep deficits have a number of adverse
      effects on well-being and performance, and athletes should ensure adequate sleep 
      throughout Ramadan. In non-Muslim majority environments, especially in team
      sports, coaches and athletes should be sensitive to the needs of their team-mates
      who may be fasting. Event organizers should take account of the needs of Muslim
      athletes when scheduling the dates and timings of sports competitions.

TI  - Coaches' knowledge and awareness of spit tobacco use among youth athletes:
      results of a 2009 Ontario survey.
PG  - 149-55
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Public health professionals have become concerned that spit tobacco
      (ST) use among athletes is increasing. However, little is known about the issue
      in Canada, particularly among youth. METHODS: The Not to Kids Coalition and the
      Coaches Association of Ontario surveyed coaches regarding ST knowledge and
      awareness and their perceived roles as coaches in influencing ST use among their 
      athletes. Surveys were distributed electronically to individuals who coached male
      and female youth aged 9 to 18 years in baseball, basketball, football, soccer,
      and track and field, in Ontario. RESULTS: Almost all of the surveyed coaches
      responded correctly to questions about the health effects of ST use, and about
      80% of respondents answered correctly to the question about legislation
      associated with ST and youth. CONCLUSION: Most coaches are interested in
      receiving information about ST, particularly the health effects of ST use and how
      to prevent ST use among athletes. Multiple formats should be used to provide
      information to coaches, including both electronic and hard copy materials.

AB  - Every year > 600,000 sports and recreation related eye injuries occur, out of
      which roughly 13,500 of these result in permanent loss of sight. Up to 90% of
      these sports related eye injuries are preventable by using adequate eye
      protection equipment. Protective eyewear is made of polycarbonate, a highly
      impact-resistant plastic which is now easily available as prescription and
      non-prescription eyewear and all players should be encouraged to use them. The
      medical officers by educating their patients regarding the risks of eye injuries 
      in various sports and the confirmed benefits of using protective equipment have
      the potential to prevent injury to over thousands of eyes every year. The medical
      fraternity can also play a very important role in educating the coaches, parents,
      and children and thus put an end to unnecessary blindness and vision loss from
      sports related ocular injuries, therefore ensuring a lifetime of healthy vision.

TI  - Athletes' perceptions of role ambiguity and coaching competency in sport teams: a
      multilevel analysis.
PG  - 345-64
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between athletes'
      perceptions of role ambiguity and two theoretically derived dimensions of
      coaching competency (i.e., game strategy and technique competencies). A total of 
      243 players from 26 teams representing various interdependent sports completed
      French versions of the Role Ambiguity Scale and the Coaching Competency Scale.
      Multilevel analyses supported the existence of relationships between the four
      dimensions of role ambiguity and the two dimensions of coaching competency at
      both individual and team levels. When the levels were considered jointly,
      athletes perceiving greater ambiguity in their role in both offensive and
      defensive contexts were more critical of their coach's capacities to lead their
      team during competitions and to diagnose or formulate instructions during
      training sessions. The results also indicated that the dimension of scope of
      responsibilities was the main contributor to the relationship with coaching
      competency at an individual level, whereas role evaluation was the main
      contributor to this relationship at a group level. Findings are discussed in
      relation to the role episode model, the role ambiguity dimensions involved in the
      relationships according to the level of analysis considered, and the salience of 
      ambiguity perceptions in the offensive context.

TI  - Promoting social inclusion through Unified Sports for youth with intellectual
      disabilities: a five-nation study.
PG  - 923-35
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2788.2012.01587.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the promotion of social inclusion through sports has
      received increased attention with other disadvantaged groups, this is not the
      case for children and adults with intellectual disability who experience marked
      social isolation. The study evaluated the outcomes from one sports programme with
      particular reference to the processes that were perceived to enhance social
      inclusion. METHOD: The Youth Unified Sports programme of Special Olympics
      combines players with intellectual disabilities (called athletes) and those
      without intellectual disabilities (called partners) of similar skill level in the
      same sports teams for training and competition. Alongside the development of
      sporting skills, the programme offers athletes a platform to socialise with peers
      and to take part in the life of their community. Unified football and basketball 
      teams from five countries--Germany, Hungary, Poland, Serbia and
      Ukraine--participated. Individual and group interviews were held with athletes,
      partners, coaches, parents and community leaders: totalling around 40 informants 
      per country. RESULTS: Qualitative data analysis identified four thematic
      processes that were perceived by informants across all countries and the two
      sports to facilitate social inclusion of athletes. These were: (1) the personal
      development of athletes and partners; (2) the creation of inclusive and equal
      bonds; (3) the promotion of positive perceptions of athletes; and (4) building
      alliances within local communities. CONCLUSIONS: Unified Sports does provide a
      vehicle for promoting the social inclusion of people with intellectual
      disabilities that is theoretically credible in terms of social capital
      scholarship and which contains lessons for advancing social inclusion in other
      contexts. Nonetheless, certain limitations are identified that require further
      consideration to enhance athletes' social inclusion in the wider community.

      may impart specific biomechanical stresses and subsequent injury patterns. The
      clinician must understand these aspects as well as the spinal changes that occur 
      with growth when many of these injuries often occur. Further, athletes, parents, 
      coaches, and healthcare providers must be sensitive to the overall aspects of the
      athlete, including nutrition, overtraining, adequate recovery, proper technique, 
      and limiting repetition of difficult maneuvers to minimize injuries.

AB  - Sports dentistry is one of the most recent and upcoming field in dentistry. It
      mainly includes the prevention and management of athletics-related orofacial
      injuries and associated oral diseases. The sports or team dentist assists
      athletes in the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of oral injuries. The most
      significant aspect in preventing sports-related orofacial injuries is wearing
      basic protective devices such as properly-fitting helmets, face masks and/or
      mouth guards. Dental injuries are the most common type of orofacial injury
      sustained during participation in sports. Many athletes are not aware of the
      health implications of a traumatic injury to the mouth or of the potential for
      incurring severe head and orofacial injuries while playing. The dentist can play 
      an imperative role in informing athletes, coaches and patients about the
      importance of preventing orofacial injuries in sports. The aim of this paper is
      to increase professional awareness and interest for orientation toward sports
      dentistry.

TI  - The use of the dual-task paradigm in detecting gait performance deficits
      following a sports-related concussion: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this systematic review was to determine the viability 
      of the dual-task paradigm in the evaluation of a sports-related concussion.
      DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Eight electronic databases 
      were searched from their inception until the 11(th) of April 2011. Studies were
      grouped according to their reported gait performance variables and their time(s) 
      of assessment(s). Raw mean differences (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI)
      were calculated based on raw means and standard deviations for gait performance
      measures in both single- and dual-task conditions. Dual-task deficits were pooled
      using a random effects model and heterogeneity (I(2)) between studies was
      assessed. RESULTS: Ten studies representing a total sample of 168 concussed and
      167 matched (age and gender) non-concussed participants met the inclusion
      criteria. Meta-analysis demonstrated that dual-task performance deficits were
      detected (p<0.05) in the concussed group for gait velocity (GV) (MD=-0.133; 95%
      CI -0.197, -0.069) and range of motion of the centre of mass in the coronal plane
      (ML-ROM) (MD=0.007; 95% CI 0.002, 0.011), but not in the non-concussed group; GV 
      (MD=-0.048; 95% CI -0.101, 0.006), ML-ROM (MD=0.002; 95% CI -0.001, 0.005).
      CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that GV and ML-ROM are sensitive 
      measures of dual-task related changes in concussed patients and should be
      considered as part of a comprehensive assessment for a sports-related concussion.

TI  - Three generalizability studies of the components of perceived coach support.
PG  - 238-51
AB  - Coaches are important providers of social support, but what influences us to
      perceive our coaches as supportive or unsupportive? We investigated the extent to
      which perceptions of coach support reflect characteristics of athletes and
      coaches, as well as relational components. In three studies, athletes judged the 
      actual or hypothetical supportiveness of various coaches. The methods of
      generalizability theory permitted us to conclude that perceptions of coach
      support primarily reflected relational components, with characteristics both of
      athletes and coaches also independently playing (lesser) roles. These findings
      suggest that athletes may systematically disagree on the supportiveness of their 
      coaches.

TI  - Assessing coach motivation: the development of the Coach Motivation Questionnaire
      (CMQ).
PG  - 184-207
AB  - The aim of this research was to develop and assess the psychometric properties of
      the Coach Motivation Questionnaire (CMQ). Study 1 focused on the compilation and 
      pilot testing of potential questionnaire items. Consistent with
      self-determination theory, items were devised to tap into six forms of
      motivation: amotivation, external regulation, introjected regulation, identified 
      regulation, integrated regulation, and intrinsic motivation. The purpose of the
      second study (N = 556) was to empirically examine the psychometric properties of 
      the CMQ. Items were subjected to confirmatory factor analyses to determine the
      fit of the a priori model. In addition, the validity of the questionnaire was
      assessed through links with the theoretically related concepts of intrinsic need 
      satisfaction, well-being, and goal orientation. Together with test-retest
      reliability (Study 3), these results showed preliminary support for the
      psychometric properties of the CMQ. Finally, using an independent sample (N =
      254), the fourth study confirmed the factor structure and supports the use of the
      CMQ in future coaching research.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the professional experiences and
      work-related outcomes of male and female Division I strength and conditioning
      coaches (SCCs). Data were collected using multiple methods, first using an online
      questionnaire and second using semistructured telephone interviews. It was found 
      that although SCCs generally felt supported, satisfied, and committed, several
      issues surrounding these constructs were present. Integrating the discussion of
      gender allowed for the implications of another salient social category within
      male-dominated professional field to be explored. Several implications and future
      directions are offered.

AB  - Research into expertise is increasing across a number of domains pertinent to
      sport. Whilst this increase is particularly apparent in coaching, a key question 
      is how to identify an expert coach? Accordingly, this paper draws upon existing
      studies into expert coaches to address this issue; in particular, the criteria
      used to select expert coaches for research purposes and the methods used in
      expert coach research. Based on these data, we contend that the elements of
      expertise are not fully reflected within currently accepted criteria which, in
      turn, results in expert coaching research not necessarily identifying the
      appropriate individuals to study. The paper concludes with recommendations for
      more rigorous criteria for selecting expert coaches and highlights the associated
      implications for the future training and development of expert coaches.

TI  - Medical sports injuries in the youth athlete: emergency management.
PG  - 242-51
AB  - As the number of youth sports participants continues to rise over the past
      decade, so too have sports related injuries and emergency department visits. With
      low levels of oversight and regulation observed in youth sports, the
      responsibility for safety education of coaches, parents, law makers,
      organizations and institutions falls largely on the sports medicine practitioner.
      The highly publicized catastrophic events of concussion, sudden cardiac death,
      and heat related illness have moved these topics to the forefront of sports
      medicine discussions. Updated guidelines for concussion in youth athletes call
      for a more conservative approach to management in both the acute and return to
      sport phases. Athletes younger than eighteen suspected of having a concussion are
      no longer allowed to return to play on the same day. Reducing the risk of sudden 
      cardiac death in the young athlete is a multi-factorial process encompassing
      pre-participation screenings, proper use of safety equipment, proper rules and
      regulations, and immediate access to Automated External Defibrillators (AED) as
      corner stones. Susceptibility to heat related illness for youth athletes is no
      longer viewed as rooted in physiologic variations from adults, but instead, as
      the result of various situations and conditions in which participation takes
      place. Hydration before, during and after strenuous exercise in a high heat
      stress environment is of significant importance. Knowledge of identification,
      management and risk reduction in emergency medical conditions of the young
      athlete positions the sports physical therapist as an effective provider,
      advocate and resource for safety in youth sports participation. This manuscript
      provides the basis for management of 3 major youth emergency sports medicine
      conditions.

      sport psychology.
PG  - 224-47

AB  - One of the most remarkable capacities of the mind is its ability to simulate
      sensations, actions, and other types of experience. A mental simulation process
      that has attracted recent attention from cognitive neuroscientists and sport
      psychologists is motor imagery or the mental rehearsal of actions without
      engaging in the actual physical movements involved. Research on motor imagery is 
      important in psychology because it provides an empirical window on consciousness 
      and movement planning, rectifies a relative neglect of non-visual types of mental
      imagery, and has practical implications for skill learning and skilled
      performance in special populations (e.g., athletes, surgeons). Unfortunately,
      contemporary research on motor imagery is hampered by a variety of semantic,
      conceptual, and methodological issues that prevent cross-fertilization of ideas
      between cognitive neuroscience and sport psychology. In this paper, we review
      these issues, suggest how they can be resolved, and sketch some potentially
      fruitful new directions for inter-disciplinary research in motor imagery.

PG  - 233-8
LID - 10.1111/j.1746-1561.2012.00692.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Concussions remain a serious public health concern. It is important
      that persons involved in youth sports, particularly coaches, be made aware and
      educated on the signs and symptoms of concussion. This study assessed the
      perceptions of youth sport coaches who have received the Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention's (CDC's) "Heads Up: Concussion in Youth Sports" materials
      in preventing, recognizing, and responding to concussions. METHODS: A 22-item
      survey was developed with questions pertaining to demographics, awareness of
      sports-related concussion, and the usefulness of the CDC's "Heads Up: Concussion 
      in Youth Sports" initiative and materials. A total of 340 youth sport coaches
      completed the survey, for a response rate of 34.0%. RESULTS: All youth sport
      coaches reported having the "Heads Up" materials for approximately 6 months
      before completing the survey. Seventy-seven percent of youth sports coaches
      reported being better able to identify athletes who may have a concussion, with
      50% reported having learned something new about concussion after reviewing the
      materials. Sixty-three percent of youth sport coaches viewed concussions as being
      more serious, while 72% of coaches reporting that they are now educating others
      on concussion. CONCLUSION: The "Heads Up" materials demonstrated that youth
      sports coaches' were able to appropriately prevent, recognize, and respond to
      sports-related concussions after reviewing the materials. Future studies should
      concentrate on evaluating the impact of concussion policies, laws and media
      coverage on coaches' awareness and prevention, recognition, and response to
      concussions using a rigorous design including a control group.

PG  - 217-30
LID - 10.1111/j.1468-3148.2011.00658.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Promoting the health and social participation of adolescents with
      intellectual disability is important as they are particularly vulnerable to
      encountering difficulties in those areas. Integration of these individuals in
      integrated sports is one strategy to address this issue. METHODS: The main
      objective of this study was to gain a better understanding of the factors
      associated with the integration of adolescents with intellectual disability in
      sports alongside their non-disabled peers. Individual interviews were completed
      with 40 adolescents with intellectual disability and their parents, while 39
      rehabilitation staff participated via either a discussion group or
      self-administered questionnaires. The Disability Creation Process (DCP)
      theoretical model was used to frame the analysis and the presentation of the
      findings (The Quebec Classification: Disability Creation Process. International
      Network on the Disability Creation Process/CSICIDH, Quebec, QC, 1998). RESULTS:
      Various personal and environmental factors that have an impact on integration in 
      sports were identified by participants. For example, attitudes, practical
      support, individuals' experiences in sports and in integrated settings as well as
      behaviour control emerged as important elements to consider. CONCLUSIONS:
      Integration in integrated sports can engender a lot of benefits for individuals
      with intellectual disability, their parents and non-disabled athletes. However,
      many barriers need to be removed before such benefits can be more widely
      realized.

TI  - Sports nutrition knowledge among collegiate athletes, coaches, athletic trainers,
      and strength and conditioning specialists.
PG  - 205-11
AB  - CONTEXT: Coaches, athletic trainers (ATs), strength and conditioning specialists 
      (SCSs), and registered dietitians are common nutrition resources for athletes,
      but coaches, ATs, and SCSs might offer only limited nutrition information. Little
      research exists about sports nutrition knowledge and current available resources 
      for nutrition information for athletes, coaches, ATs, and SCSs. OBJECTIVE: To
      identify resources of nutrition information that athletes, coaches, ATs, and SCSs
      use; to examine nutrition knowledge among athletes, coaches, ATs, and SCSs; and
      to determine confidence levels in the correctness of nutrition knowledge
      questions within all groups. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: National
      Collegiate Athletic Association Division I, II, and III institutions across the
      United States. PATIENTS AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS: The 579 participants consisted of
      athletes (n = 185), coaches (n = 131), ATs (n = 192), and SCSs (n = 71). MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Participants answered questions about nutrition resources and
      domains regarding basic nutrition, supplements and performance, weight
      management, and hydration. Adequate sports nutrition knowledge was defined as an 
      overall score of 75% in all domains (highest achievable score was 100%). RESULTS:
      Participants averaged 68.5% in all domains. The ATs (77.8%) and SCSs (81.6%) had 
      the highest average scores. Adequate knowledge was found in 35.9% of coaches,
      71.4% of ATs, 83.1% of SCSs, and only 9% of athletes. The most used nutrition
      resources for coaches, ATs, and SCSs were registered dietitians. CONCLUSIONS:
      Overall, we demonstrated that ATs and SCSs have adequate sports nutrition
      knowledge, whereas most coaches and athletes have inadequate knowledge. Athletes 
      have frequent contact with ATs and SCSs; therefore, proper nutrition education
      among these staff members is critical. We suggest that proper nutrition
      programming should be provided for athletes, coaches, ATs, and SCSs. However, a
      separate nutrition program should be integrated for ATs and SCSs. This
      integrative approach is beneficial for the continuity of care, as both categories
      of professionals might be developing and integrating preventive or rehabilitative
      programs for athletes.

TI  - Correlation of aggressiveness and anxiety in fighting sports.
PG  - 116-21
AB  - INTRODUCTION: in fighting sports there are many opened issues related with levels
      of aggression and anxiety. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Our study is performed with
      healthy young athletes: kick boxers, karate fighters, and boxers. Examined group 
      consisted of 55 members (45 male) with average age of 20.2 +/- 3.8 years. In
      analysis of level of aggression Questionnaire A-87 is used. Its purpose is
      assessment of aggressive behaviour in provoked situations, or measurement of
      impulsive aggression. Questionnaire A-87 consists of 15 items of different
      situations with five possible responses. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The possible
      responses or reactions are the five most frequent forms of aggressive responses: 
      a) verbal manifest aggression (VM); b) physical manifest aggression (PHM); c)
      indirect aggression (IND); d) verbal latent aggression (VL), and e) physical
      latent aggression (PHL). In the analysis of anxiety is used Beck Anxiety
      Inventory, BAI. Average training period was 7.8 +/- 3.6 years. Even 37 athletes
      during sporting carriers were injured, and most of examiners (precisely 13)
      experienced 3 injuries. Average value of BAI was 12.7 +/- 8.7. Average value of
      total aggression was 152.2 +/- 40.9; highest levels were observed in VM (33.9)
      and VL (30.1). Significant positive correlations of all components of aggression 
      with level of anxiety is observed (p < 0.05), most prominent IND (r = 0.4263; p =
      0.0012), and VL (r = 0.4163; p = 0.0016), and also total aggression (r = 0.4822; 
      p = 0.0002). Slightly significant positive correlation of total aggression with
      age of examiners is also observed (r = 0.2668, p = 0.0489). Positive correlation 
      VM (r = 0.4928; p = 0.0001), PHL (r = 0.2761; p = 0.0413), and total aggression
      (r = 0.347; p = 0.0094) is observed with number of injuries of examined athletes.
      Also, positive correlation (r = 0.2927, p = 0.0301) is observed with level of
      anxiety and number of injuries. Higher level of aggression and anxiety might
      change attitude of some sports authorities (especially coaches), and additional
      psychological training of fight sports might be necessary. CONCLUSION: Assessment
      of basically levels of aggression and anxiety of athletes might be valuable not
      only in sport activities, but in overall aspects of life.

TI  - The effects of tournament preparation on anthropometric and sport-specific
      performance measures in youth judo athletes.
PG  - 331-9
LID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e31825423b3 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to characterize the adaptations imposed by 4 weeks 
      of precompetition judo training in youth athletes. It was hypothesized that
      anthropometric and sport-specific performance would improve during the
      preparation for a junior national championship event. Twenty youth athletes (mean
      +/- SD; chronological age: 13.1 +/- 3.2 years; training age: 5.3 +/- 3.5 years;
      judo experience: 7.8 +/- 2.5 hours per week) completed pretesting and posttesting
      procedures. Child (12 years old; n = 8) and adolescent (13 years old; n = 12)
      groups were evaluated to determine the anthropometric and sport-specific
      performance changes caused by 4 weeks of judo training conducted in preparation
      for the junior national championships. The child group showed an increase in
      flexibility (11.5%), and the adolescent group showed a decrease in skinfold
      thickness (-12.2%); increased jumping power (26.7%), force (7.7%), and velocity
      (19.0%); and improved judo-specific ability (-5.9%), as measured by the Special
      Judo Fitness Test (SJFT) index. Additionally, the SJFT index for all the study
      participants was shown to be inversely correlated to handgrip strength (r =
      -0.681), rope pull performance (r = -0.545), and jump height (r = -0.503). These 
      results support the use of preparatory judo training in the improvement of
      anthropometric and sport-specific measures in adolescent athletes. Furthermore,
      the outcomes from this study provide direction for coaches and trainers in their 
      efforts to impact physical performance and judo skills in children and
      adolescents through precompetition training.

TI  - Suggestions from the field for return to sports participation following anterior 
      cruciate ligament reconstruction: soccer.
PG  - 304-12
LID - 10.2519/jospt.2012.4005 [doi]
AB  - Successful return to play remains a challenge for a soccer player after anterior 
      cruciate ligament reconstruction. In addition to a successful surgical
      intervention, a soccer-specific functional rehabilitation program is essential to
      achieve this goal. Soccer-like elements should be incorporated in the early
      stages of rehabilitation to provide neuromuscular training specific to the needs 
      of the player. Gym-based and, later, field-based drills are gradually intensified
      and progressed until the player demonstrates the ability to return to team
      practice. In addition to the recovery of basic attributes such as mobility,
      flexibility, strength, and agility, the surgically repaired knee must also regain
      soccer-specific neuromuscular control and conditioning for an effective return to
      sports. The individual coaching of the player by the sports physiotherapist and
      compliance with the training program by the player are key factors in the
      rehabilitation process. To minimize reinjury risk and to maximize the player's
      career, concepts of soccer-specific injury prevention programs should be
      incorporated into the training routine during and after the rehabilitation of
      players post-ACL reconstruction.

TI  - Management of acute sports injuries and medical conditions by South Dakota high
      school head coaches: assessment via case scenarios.
PG  - 97-9, 101-5, 107
AB  - BACKGROUND: When medical coverage does not exist at games and practices, coaches 
      are often responsible for the management of acute conditions. The question that
      arises is whether they make proper medical decisions concerning the health and
      safety of their athletes. The purpose of this study was to assess high school
      head coaches' decision-making skills related to acute medical condition
      management through the use of case scenarios. METHODS: A cover letter/web link to
      the web-based survey was e-mailed to all 2008-2009 school year South Dakota high 
      school head athletic coaches. RESULTS: Head coaches were found to be responsible 
      for the immediate care of injured athletes at practice (87.2 percent) and home
      competitions (72.3 percent). Less than 75.0 percent of coaches reported feeling
      "prepared" or "somewhat prepared" to handle 11 of the 16 types of acute athletic 
      injuries and medical conditions presented, with less than 75.0 percent of coaches
      giving "appropriate" or "overly cautious" responses to eight of the 17 cases.
      Little to no relationship was found between perceived level of preparedness for
      treating various conditions and appropriateness of responses. A significant
      difference was found in appropriateness of decisions based on level of athlete
      (68.9 percent starters, 79.3 percent non-starters) and event situation (66.5
      percent important events, 76.6 percent non-important events). CONCLUSIONS: In
      South Dakota, high school coaches are most often responsible for the initial
      management of acute injuries; yet, a large percentage of coaches did not feel
      "prepared" to manage various conditions and/or gave "inappropriate" responses to 
      multiple cases. Furthermore, the level of athlete and the event situation may
      influence coaches' decisions. Further education may include the proper management
      of head and neck injuries, multiple concussions, dislocations, heat emergencies, 
      eye injuries and internal organ injuries. Health care workers can be an integral 
      part of training coaches in the care of acute conditions, as well as providing
      practice and event coverage.

TI  - Jet lag and travel fatigue: a comprehensive management plan for sport medicine
      physicians and high-performance support teams.
PG  - 268-73
LID - 10.1097/JSM.0b013e31824d2eeb [doi]
AB  - The impact of transcontinental travel and high-volume travel on athletes can
      result in physiologic disturbances and a complicated set of physical symptoms.
      Jet lag and travel fatigue have been identified by athletes, athletic trainers,
      coaches, and physicians as important but challenging problems that could benefit 
      from practical solutions. Currently, there is a culture of disregard and lack of 
      knowledge regarding the negative effects of jet lag and travel fatigue on the
      athlete's well-being and performance. In addition, the key physiologic metric
      (determination of the human circadian phase) that guides jet lag treatment
      interventions is elusive and thus limits evidence-based therapeutic advice. A
      better understanding of preflight, in-flight, and postflight management options, 
      such as use of melatonin or the judicious application of sedatives, is important 
      for the sports clinician to help athletes limit fatigue symptoms and maintain
      optimal performance. The purpose of this article was to provide a practical
      applied method of implementing a travel management program for athletic teams.

TI  - Perceived social support from strength and conditioning coaches among injured
      student athletes.
PG  - 1154-61
LID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e31822e008b [doi]
AB  - Injuries suffered by student athletes not only affect their physical ability to
      perform in sport but also have psychological effects as well. The purpose of this
      study was to examine student athletes' perceptions, expectations, and
      satisfaction of the social support provided by their strength and conditioning
      coach (SC) during the later reconditioning stage of their rehabilitation and
      their views on the overall level of importance of each type of social support.
      One hundred and sixty-five participants aged 20.21 +/- 1.32 years from 6 Division
      I Universities in the Midwest region of the USA completed the modified Social
      Support Survey. The results of a chi-square test assessing the responses for 6
      types of social support provided by SCs based on athletes' age, gender, and sport
      revealed a significant difference (chi2[13,105] = 26.46, p = 0.015) for listening
      support differing by sport. A significant difference (chi2[13,105] = 267.74, p = 
      0.010) was also revealed for reported emotional challenge by sport. Results
      showed that the SC had a significant psychosocial impact on student-athletes'
      overall psychological well-being during reconditioning. This study provides
      evidence of the vital psychosocial role that SCs can play during an injured
      student-athlete's reconditioning program.

AB  - Analyzing an athlete's "technique," sport scientists often focus on preselected
      variables that quantify important aspects of movement. In contrast, coaches and
      practitioners typically describe movements in terms of basic postures and
      movement components using subjective and qualitative features. A challenge for
      sport scientists is finding an appropriate quantitative methodology that
      incorporates the holistic perspective of human observers. Using alpine ski racing
      as an example, this study explores principal component analysis (PCA) as a
      mathematical method to decompose a complex movement pattern into its main
      movement components. Ski racing movements were recorded by determining the
      three-dimensional coordinates of 26 points on each skier which were subsequently 
      interpreted as a 78-dimensional posture vector at each time point. PCA was then
      used to determine the mean posture and principal movements (PMk ) carried out by 
      the athletes. The first four PMk contained 95.5 +/- 0.5% of the variance in the
      posture vectors which quantified changes in body inclination, vertical or
      fore-aft movement of the trunk, and distance between skis. In summary,
      calculating PMk offered a data-driven, quantitative, and objective method of
      analyzing human movement that is similar to how human observers such as coaches
      or ski instructors would describe the movement.

AB  - We present the perspective that while coaches and instructors commonly adapt
      learning styles to maximize training outcomes, there has been little to no
      empirical support for the efficacy of this practice. Learning styles is a
      learner's preferred mode (e.g., visual, verbal) of taking in and processing new
      information. Although it is a relevant topic for the learning of motor and sport 
      skills, few studies have used an appropriate methodology to test the
      effectiveness of learning style-based instruction. We highlight the need for a
      learning style assessment tool specific to motor skills and call for a test of
      the learning style hypothesis, the claim that learners will benefit from
      instruction that is tailored to their individual learning style. To this end, we 
      suggest methodological guidelines.

TI  - Aesthetic sports as high-risk contexts for eating disorders--young elite dancers 
      and gymnasts perspectives.
PG  - 265-74
AB  - This is the first study developed in Portugal which investigates specific
      characteristics of dance and gymnastics environments that make them high-risk
      contexts for the development of eating disorders. Four focus groups were
      conducted with thirteen ballet students from a professional dance school and nine
      gymnasts from a gymnastics club (aged 12 to 17 years old), which were subjected
      to an inductive-deductive analysis procedure. Specific risk and protective
      factors were identified. Among their respective sources of influence, teachers
      and coaches are those who exert a stronger influence upon young athletes. We also
      explored some themes related to the influence of peers, parents, and
      environmental characteristics, which could have an important role on the
      development or prevention of disordered eating.

TI  - Measuring mental toughness in sport: a psychometric examination of the
      psychological performance inventory-a and its predecessor.
PG  - 393-403
LID - 10.1080/00223891.2012.660292 [doi]
AB  - Touted as a multidimensional measure of mental toughness in sport, this study
      explored the psychometric properties of the Psychological Performance Inventory
      (PPI; Loehr, 1986 ) and its successor the Psychological Performance Inventory-A
      (PPI-A; Golby, Sheard, & Van Wersch, 2007 ). Confirmatory factor analysis was
      employed to examine the extent to which data collected with 333 Australian
      footballers aged between 15 and 18 years (M = 16.88, SD = .71) fitted the a
      priori measurement models of both inventories. The results did not support the
      psychometric properties of the PPI both in terms of model fit and internal
      consistency. Although model fit data for the PPI-A were encouraging, inadequate
      levels of internal consistency were evidenced. Convergent validity analyses
      involving measures of achievement goals and global mental toughness generally
      supported the validity of the PPI and PPI-A subscales. Taken together with
      previous research (e.g., Middleton et al., 2004 ), caution is urged when
      considering the use of the PPI as a measure of mental toughness in sport.
      Although the empirical data were generally supportive of the psychometric
      properties of the PPI-A, conceptual (e.g., lack of conceptual underpinnings) and 
      methodological (i.e., revalidated a flawed inventory) concerns become important
      factors when considering the PPI-A as a measure of mental toughness.

TI  - Sport injuries in adolescents.
PG  - e18
LID - 10.4081/or.2011.e18 [doi]
AB  - In spite of the wide range of injuries in adolescents during sports activities,
      there are only a few studies investigating the type and frequency of sport
      injuries in puberty. However, this information may help to prevent, diagnose and 
      treat sports injuries among teens. 4468 injuries in adolescent patients were
      treated over a ten year period of time: 66,97% were boys and 32.88% girls. The
      most frequent sports injuries were football (31.13%) followed by handball (8.89%)
      and sports during school (8.77%). The lower extremity was involved in 68.71% of
      the cases. Knee problems were seen in 29.79% of the patients; 2.57% spine and
      1.99% head injuries. Injuries consisted primarily of distortions (35.34%) and
      ligament tears (18.76%); 9,00% of all injuries were fractures. We found more skin
      wounds (6:1) and fractures (7:2) in male patients compared to females. The risk
      of ligament tears was highest during skiing. Three of four ski injuries led to
      knee problems. Spine injuries were observed most often during horse riding (1:6).
      Head injuries were seen in bicycle accidents (1:3). Head injuries were seen in
      male patients much more often then in female patients (21:1). Fractures were
      noted during football (1:9), skiing (1:9), inline (2:3), and during school sports
      (1:11). Many adolescents participate in various sports. Notwithstanding the
      methodological problems with epidemiological data, there is no doubt about the
      large number of athletes sustain musculoskeletal injuries, sometimes serious. In 
      most instances, the accident does not happened during professional sports and
      training. Therefore, school teachers and low league trainer play an important
      role preventing further accidence based on knowledge of individual risk patterns 
      of different sports.It is imperative to provide preventive medical check-ups, to 
      monitor the sport-specific needs for each individual sports, to observe the
      training skills as well as physical fitness needed and to evaluation coaches
      education.

TI  - Relationship between running loads and soft-tissue injury in elite team sport
      athletes.
PG  - 953-60
LID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3182302023 [doi]
AB  - Although the potential link between running loads and soft-tissue injury is
      appealing, the evidence supporting or refuting this relationship in
      high-performance team sport athletes is nonexistent, with all published studies
      using subjective measures (e.g., ratings of perceived exertion) to quantify
      training loads. The purpose of this study was to investigate the risk of
      low-intensity (e.g., walking, jogging, total distances) and high-intensity (e.g.,
      high acceleration and velocity efforts, repeated high-intensity exercise bouts)
      movement activities on lower body soft-tissue injury in elite team sport
      athletes. Thirty-four elite rugby league players participated in this study.
      Global positioning system data and the incidence of lower body soft-tissue
      injuries were monitored in 117 skill training sessions during the preseason and
      in-season periods. The frailty model (an extension of the Cox proportional
      regression model for recurrent events) was applied to calculate the relative risk
      of injury after controlling for all other training data. The risk of injury was
      2.7 (95% confidence interval 1.2-6.5) times higher when very high-velocity
      running (i.e., sprinting) exceeded 9 m per session. Greater distances covered in 
      mild, moderate, and maximum accelerations and low- and very low-intensity
      movement velocities were associated with a reduced risk of injury. These results 
      demonstrate that greater amounts of very high-velocity running (i.e., sprinting) 
      are associated with an increased risk of lower body soft-tissue injury, whereas
      distances covered at low and moderate speeds offer a protective effect against
      soft-tissue injury. From an injury prevention perspective, these findings provide
      empirical support for restricting the amount of sprinting performed in
      preparation for elite team sport competition. However, coaches should also
      consider the consequences of reducing training loads on the development of
      physical qualities and playing performance.

TI  - Implementation of effective alcohol control strategies is needed at large sports 
      and entertainment events.
PG  - 55-60

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the implementation and effectiveness of strategies and
      actions to eliminate and/or reduce alcohol-related problems at large sports and
      entertainment events in New Zealand. METHODS: We conducted site visits and
      monitoring observations at venues before, during and after a variety of large
      events between March 2009 and November 2010. Thirteen events were attended at
      nine different venues. Events included rugby, rugby league and cricket matches,
      motor racing, rowing, horse racing, an outdoor music festival, and food and wine 
      festivals. RESULTS: Most large events appeared to pass with few or no
      alcohol-related problems. The exceptions were one of the horse-race meetings, a
      rugby league match and one food and wine festival. Common contexts at events
      where alcohol-related problems were seen included: inadequate alcohol control and
      management by security staff; the ability to purchase four alcoholic drinks
      (rather than two) at a time; inexperienced bar staff untrained in responsible
      alcohol service; no or little promotion of low and non-alcoholic drinks; and a
      lack of monitoring and enforcement of the law on intoxication. CONCLUSIONS: An
      important approach to prevent and reduce alcohol-related problems at large spots 
      and entertainment events is the use of specific alcohol-control strategies. The
      management of alcohol consumption is a major part of event management that must
      be planned with harm-minimisation strategies well in advance of the event itself.
      IMPLICATIONS: If strategies and actions are not properly implemented to manage
      the sale and supply of alcohol at large events, there is significant risk of
      alcohol-related problems and harm resulting from them.

TI  - Global positioning system data analysis: velocity ranges and a new definition of 
      sprinting for field sport athletes.
PG  - 818-24
LID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3182276555 [doi]
AB  - Global positioning system (GPS) technology has improved the speed, accuracy, and 
      ease of time-motion analyses of field sport athletes. The large volume of
      numerical data generated by GPS technology is usually summarized by reporting the
      distance traveled and time spent in various locomotor categories (e.g., walking, 
      jogging, and running). There are a variety of definitions used in the literature 
      to represent these categories, which makes it nearly impossible to compare
      findings among studies. The purpose of this work was to propose standard
      definitions (velocity ranges) that were determined by an objective analysis of
      time-motion data. In addition, we discuss the limitations of the existing
      definition of a sprint and present a new definition of sprinting for field sport 
      athletes. Twenty-five GPS data files collected from 5 different sports (men's and
      women's field hockey, men's and women's soccer, and Australian Rules Football)
      were analyzed to identify the average velocity distribution. A curve fitting
      process was then used to determine the optimal placement of 4 Gaussian curves
      representing the typical locomotor categories. Based on the findings of these
      analyses, we make recommendations about sport-specific velocity ranges to be used
      in future time-motion studies of field sport athletes. We also suggest that a
      sprint be defined as any movement that reaches or exceeds the sprint threshold
      velocity for at least 1 second and any movement with an acceleration that occurs 
      within the highest 5% of accelerations found in the corresponding velocity range.
      From a practical perspective, these analyses provide conditioning coaches with
      information on the high-intensity sprinting demands of field sport athletes,
      while also providing a novel method of capturing maximal effort, short-duration
      sprints.

AB  - Physical activity is beneficial for children with positive outcomes for mental
      and physical well-being. Allergic conditions unique to the sporting arena may
      serve as an impediment to participation in physical activity for allergic
      children. A common example is exercise-induced asthma; less common
      activity-related allergic conditions include food-dependent exercise-induced
      anaphylaxis, exercise-induced anaphylaxis, and exercise-induced urticaria.
      Allergic children may also be at risk of allergic reactions when exposed to
      allergens that are more commonly found in the sports environment, e.g., latex,
      sports drinks, and medications such as NSAIDs. Recent advances in our
      understanding of the patho-physiological and immunologic mechanisms that may
      account for these conditions have facilitated more effective and safer management
      strategies. There are also important immunologic lessons to be learnt with
      respect to specific physical factors that may result in diminished allergen
      tolerance; indeed, these lessons may facilitate safer allergen desensitisation
      regimens. The role of the immune system in exercise-induced immunoallergic
      syndromes, clinical aspects, and diagnostic and therapeutic approaches are
      discussed in this review.

TI  - Coach autonomy support, basic need satisfaction, and intrinsic motivation of
      paralympic athletes.
PG  - 722-30
AB  - The purpose of the present study, grounded in self-determination theory, was to
      explore the relationship between Paralympic athletes' perceptions of
      autonomy-supportive coach behavior basic psychological needs, and intrinsic
      motivation to know, accomplish, and experience stimulation. One hundred thirteen 
      Canadian Paralympic athletes completed an online survey, consisting of measures
      of coach autonomy support; of perceptions of autonomy, competence, and
      relatedness; and of intrinsic motivation. Perceived coach autonomy support was a 
      predictor of athletes' perceptions of autonomy and relatedness. Perceived
      competence was a significant predictor of all three forms of intrinsic
      motivation, while perceived autonomy was a significant predictor of intrinsic
      motivation to accomplish and experience stimulation. The results highlight the
      important relationship between coach behavior and athlete motivation in
      disability sport.

TI  - Kids speak: preferred parental behavior at youth sport events.
PG  - 702-11
AB  - News reports (e.g., Abrams, 2008) and scholarly research (e.g., Wiersma & Fife,
      2005) have indicated increasing concern that parent-spectator behavior at youth
      sport events may be problematic. Multiple strategies have been used to influence 
      spectator behavior in youth sport contexts (e.g., "Silent Sundays"). However it
      is unlikely that interventions aimed at changing parent-spectator behaviors have 
      adequately considered young athletes' perspectives, because little is known about
      how children want parents to behave during youth sport events. Therefore,
      children (ages 7-14 years) were asked to describe how parents actually behaved at
      youth sport events and how they wanted parents to behave. Through grounded theory
      analysis (Charmaz, 2000), three parent "roles" emerged from the data-supportive
      parent, demanding coach, and crazed fan.

AB  - Gymnastics talent identification focuses on the identification of young gymnasts 
      who display characteristics for potential success in the future. The aim of this 
      study was to identify which current performance characteristics are related to
      performance in competition 2 years later. Twenty-three female gymnasts aged 7-8
      years completed a multidimensional test battery measuring anthropometric,
      physical, and coordinative characteristics and were technically evaluated by
      expert coaches. Two years later, the all-around competition results of those
      gymnasts now participating in elite (n = 12) and sub-elite (n = 11) competition
      were obtained. None of the initial measurements significantly correlated with the
      results of the sub-elite gymnasts 2 years later. For the elite gymnasts, a
      non-sport-specific motor test battery correlated strongly with the competition
      result, with more than 40% of the variation in competition performance being
      explained by the result on that test 2 years earlier. Neither the coaches'
      judgement nor the anthropometric and physical characteristics were sensitive
      enough to predict performance. A motor coordination test might be valuable in the
      early identification of gymnasts, as its discriminative and predictive qualities 
      might be sufficiently powerful for selection within a relatively homogeneous
      population of gymnasts exhibiting similar anthropometric and physical profiles.

      substantive-methodological synergy.
PG  - 779-806
AB  - The purpose of this article was to provide a substantive-methodological synergy
      of potential importance to future research in sport and exercise psychology. The 
      substantive focus was to improve the measurement of coaching efficacy by
      developing a revised version of the coaching efficacy scale (CES) for head
      coaches (N = 557) of youth sport teams (CES II-YST). The methodological focus was
      exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM), a methodology that integrates
      the advantages of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor
      analysis (CFA) within the general structural equation model (SEM). The synergy
      was a demonstration of how ESEM (as compared with CFA) may be used, guided by
      content knowledge, to develop (or confirm) a measurement model for the CES
      II-YST. A single-group ESEM provided evidence for close model-data fit, while a
      single-group CFA fit significantly worse than the single-group ESEM and provided 
      evidence for only approximate model-data fit. A multiple-group ESEM provided
      evidence for partial factorial invariance by coach's gender.

TI  - Longitudinal follow-up of biochemical markers of fatigue throughout a sporting
      season in young elite rugby players.

LID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3182474687 [doi]
AB  - The aims of this study were to evaluate links between biochemical markers and
      competition and training conditions, overtraining questionnaire scores, and
      anthropometric characteristics of young elite rugby players and to identify
      evolving profiles of fatigue during the sports season. Twelve elite rugby players
      were included in the study. The tests were carried out every 15 days over the
      course of one sporting season from July until March, including the interseason.
      Changes in body composition parameters, blood biochemistry, and scores on various
      questionnaires were examined. The majority of the biochemical parameters and
      subjective variables showed significant variations over time. There were
      significant positive correlations between overtraining scores and alanine amino
      transferase (ALAT; r = 0.24, p < 0.05) and creatine phosphokinase (CK; r = 0.3, p
      < 0.01) levels. In addition, game time was significantly correlated with changes 
      in CK (r = 0.46, p < 0.01), whereas difficult training sessions were
      significantly correlated with changes in both CK (r = 0.27, p < 0.05) and ALAT (r
      = 0.33, p < 0.01). We suggest that regular monitoring of these biochemical
      parameters may provide important information for the coach on the fatigue of
      rugby players and their perceived difficulty of training.

TI  - Lifetime injury prevention: the sport profile model.
PG  - 193-7
LID - 10.1136/bjsports-2011-090417 [doi]
AB  - Participation in sporting activities carries an injury risk. Conversely, the
      increased awareness that physical inactivity is a major risk factor for disease
      has led government agencies and the medical community to encourage increased
      levels of physical activity. Many people will achieve this through participation 
      in sport. Injury inevitably leads to a reduction in participation on a temporary 
      or permanent basis, but the injury experience may also influence the lifelong
      physical activity behaviour. Few studies adequately examine the possible
      long-term consequences of sport participation after the competitive period has
      been completed, but by understanding the patterns of injuries in different sports
      one test can develop strategies to prevent and better manage the conditions that 
      occur and promote lifelong physical activity. There is a need to develop models
      of understanding of injury risk at different life phases and levels of
      participation in a specific sport. The risk assessment of sport participation has
      to be relevant to a particular sport, the level of participation, skill, age and 
      potential future health consequences. This article describes a sport-specific
      model which will improve guidance for coaches and healthcare professionals. It
      poses questions for sports physicians, healthcare providers, educators and for
      governing bodies of sports to address in a systematic fashion. Additionally the
      governing body, as an employer, will need to meet the requirements for risk
      assessment for professional sport and its ethical responsibility to the athlete.

AB  - Coaches can exert a considerable influence on the lives of their athletes.
      However, little is known about the influence of athletic coaches on athlete
      drinking behaviors. This study extends research on drinking influences in
      student-athletes. The relationship between athletic coaches and athlete drinking 
      behaviors were examined. First-year college students (N=362) who had played high 
      school sports were assessed on their relationships with their coaches as well as 
      their alcohol use and problems. Findings revealed significant associations among 
      the approval of and relationship with their athletic coaches and student drinking
      behaviors. These findings are discussed in the context of involving coaches in
      comprehensive strategies to reduce athlete drinking.

TI  - Concerns regarding hair cortisol as a biomarker of chronic stress in exercise and
      sport science.
PG  - 571-81
AB  - Hair cortisol has the potential to fill the methodological void of long-term
      cortisol assessment while becoming a widely accepted measure in biopsychology.
      This review critically examines the applicability and relevance of hair cortisol 
      measurement specifically within the field of exercise and sport science. Current 
      measures of the HPA axis only cover a brief time period, whereas hair cortisol is
      a unique, non-invasive means to capture long- term cortisol secretion. Studies
      have shown that individuals who have elevated cortisol secretion (e.g. due to
      diseases associated with a disturbed activation of the HPA axis or exposure to
      stressful life events) reveal increased hair cortisol. By contrast, only weak
      correlations exist between hair cortisol and perceived stress, and the direction 
      of the relationship between hair cortisol levels and mental disorders is unclear.
      Acute exercise, however, results in increased levels of cortisol that eventually 
      is reflected in higher levels of cortisol in hair samples and studies have shown 
      that exercise intensity is related to hair cortisol level. Thus, elevated hair
      cortisol levels found among regular exercisers are not necessarily pathological. 
      Thus, one should practice caution when associating athletes' elevated hair
      cortisol with poor mental health or disease. Hair cortisol analysis can
      contribute to a more complete understanding of how long-term cortisol elevation
      mediates stress-related effects on the health and performance of recreational
      exercisers and elite athletes. Nevertheless, it is crucial for exercise and sport
      scientists to consider whether their research questions can be adequately
      addressed, given that regular intense exercise results in substantially augmented
      hair cortisol levels.

AB  - Historically, humans have long sought to enhance their "athletic" performance to 
      increase body weight, aggressiveness, mental concentration and physical strength,
      contextually reducing fatigue, pain, and improving recovery. Although regular
      training is the mainstay for achieving these targets, the ancillary use of
      ergogenic aids has become commonplace in all sports. The demarcation between
      ergogenic aids and doping substances or practices is continuously challenging and
      mostly based on perceptions regarding the corruption of the fairness of
      competition and the potential side effects or adverse events arising from the use
      of otherwise unnecessary ergogenic substances. A kaleidoscope of side effects has
      been associated with the use of doping agents, including behavioral, skeletal,
      endocrinologic, metabolic, hemodynamic, and cardiovascular imbalances. Among the 
      various doping substances, the most striking association with thrombotic
      complications has been reported for androgenic anabolic steroids (i.e.,
      cardiomyopathy, fatal and nonfatal arrhythmias, myocardial infarction [MI],
      intracardiac thrombosis, stroke, venous thromboembolism [VTE], limb arterial
      thrombosis, branch retinal vein occlusion, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis) and 
      blood boosting (i.e., VTE and MI, especially for epoetin and analogs). The
      potential thrombotic complication arising from misuse of other doping agents such
      as the administration of cortisol, growth hormone, prolactin, cocaine, and
      platelet-derived preparations is instead speculative or anecdotal at best. The
      present article provides an overview on the epidemiological association as well
      as the underlying biochemical and biological mechanisms linking the practice of
      doping in sports with the development of thrombosis.

TI  - Is sports safety policy being translated into practice: what can be learnt from
      the Australian rugby union Mayday procedure?
PG  - 585-90
LID - 10.1136/bjsports-2011-090469 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To investigate the level of translation of the Australian Rugby Union
      'Mayday' safety procedure into practice among community rugby union coaches in
      New South Wales (Australia). METHODS: All registered coaches of senior community 
      rugby union teams in five zones/associations in the north-eastern region of the
      state were invited to complete a short online questionnaire at the end of the
      2010 rugby season. The questionnaire was designed around the five RE-AIM
      dimensions and assessed: Reach, perceived Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation
      and Maintenance of the Mayday procedure. RESULTS: Seventy (39%) coaches
      participated. There was a high level of awareness of the Mayday procedure, and
      most coaches believed it was effective in preventing injuries. The majority
      reported training their players in the procedure, although training was generally
      infrequent. Coaches were confident that their own players could implement the
      procedure appropriately if required to do so, but less confident that other teams
      or referees could do so. Barriers to providing training included not enough
      players at training, players not taking training seriously and technical
      difficulties (eg, verbalisation of instructions for physical tasks). CONCLUSION: 
      The findings suggest that the translation of the Mayday 'policy' could be
      improved by building individual coach, and club or zone organisational capacity
      by ensuring that coaches have the resources and skills in 'how' to train their
      players to complement their existing knowledge on 'what' to train them; setting
      expectations that encourage coaches to provide regular training for players; and 
      regular monitoring of player competency to perform the procedure appropriately.

TI  - A qualitative study on overuse injuries: the beliefs of athletes and coaches.
PG  - 116-21
LID - 10.1016/j.jsams.2011.11.253 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Preventive approaches for overuse injuries in sports will be more
      successful when synchronised with athletes' and coaches' beliefs. We interviewed 
      athletes and coaches in order to better characterize their beliefs about the
      definition of an overuse injury, as well as the intrinsic and extrinsic risk
      factors that underlie overuse injuries. DESIGN: Qualitative study using in-depth 
      interviews in athletes and coaches of different sports. METHODS: Athletes who had
      experienced overuse injuries and coaches who trained athletes who had sustained
      overuse injuries from sports clubs were invited to participate through interview.
      We explored each participant's individual definition of an overuse injury and the
      beliefs concerning the intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors concerning overuse
      injuries were explored. RESULTS: After nine athletes and nine coaches, sample
      size saturation was confirmed. Athletes and coaches integrate somatic as well as 
      psychological and sociological factors into the definition of and risk factors
      for overuse injuries. Intrinsic factors for an overuse injury were related to
      physical factors, technique, psychological factors and heredity. The extrinsic
      factors were related to situational, social and training factors, as well as the 
      individual coach. CONCLUSIONS: Athletes and coaches have a holistic view on the
      definition of overuse injuries, and the intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors for 
      overuse injuries. If preventive approaches for overuse injuries are developed and
      implemented, they should incorporate physical factors, as well as incorporate
      psychological and social factors. Based on the input of coaches and athletes, the
      latter are important risk factors for overuse injuries.

      concussion: an inter-organization position statement.
PG  - 119-22
LID - 10.1093/arclin/acr077 [doi]
AB  - Over the past 20 years, clinical neuropsychologists have been at the forefront of
      both scientific and clinical initiatives aimed at developing evidence-based
      approaches to the evaluation and management of sport-related concussion (SRC).
      These efforts have directly impacted current policy on strategies for injury
      assessment and return-to-play by athletes after concussion. Many states are
      considering legislation requiring (a) education of athletes, parents, coaches,
      and school/organization officials on the recognition, evaluation, and management 
      of SRCs; (b) removal from play of any youth athlete that is suspected of having
      sustained a concussion; and (c) not allowing the student to return to
      participation until the student is evaluated and cleared for return to
      participation in writing by an appropriate healthcare professional. It is the
      official position of the American Academy of Clinical Neuropsychology (AACN),
      American Board of Professional Neuropsychology (ABN), Division 40
      (Neuropsychology) of the American Psychological Association (APA), and the
      National Academy of Neuropsychology (NAN) that neuropsychologists should be
      included among the licensed healthcare professionals authorized to evaluate,
      clinically manage, and provide return to play clearance for athletes who sustain 
      a SRC.

TI  - Youth sport specialization: how to manage competition and training?
PG  - 572-9
AB  - A prevailing theory (and practical application) is that elite performance
      requires early childhood skill development and training across various domains,
      including sport. Debate continues whether children specializing early (ie,
      training/competition in a single sport) have true advantage compared with those
      who sample various sports early and specialize in a single sport later
      (adolescence). Retrospective data and case studies suggest either model yields
      elite status depending upon the sport category (ie, situational: ball games,
      martial arts, fencing; quantitative: track and field, swimming, skiing; or
      qualitative: gymnastics, diving, figure skating). However, potential risks of
      early specialization include greater attrition and adverse physical/emotional
      health outcomes. With the advent of the IOC Youth Olympic Games, increased
      emphasis on global youth competition has unknown implications but also represents
      a potential platform for investigation. Modification of youth competition formats
      should be based upon multidisciplinary research on psychophysiological responses,
      and technical-tactical behaviors during competition. The assumption that a simple
      scaled-down approach of adult competitions facilitates the development of
      technical/tactical skills of youth athletes is not necessarily substantiated with
      field-based research. Relatively little evidence exists regarding the long-term
      effects of rigorous training and competitive schedules on children in specific
      sports. It is clear that more prospective studies are needed to understand the
      training dose that optimally develops adaptations in youth without inducing
      dropout, overtraining syndrome, and/or injury. Such an approach should be sport
      specific as well as gender based. Until such evidence exists, coaches and sport
      administrators will continue to rely upon their sport-specific dogma to influence
      programmatic development of our most vulnerable population.

AB  - The Olympic environment has been identified as particularly stressful and unlike 
      any other in terms of the media attention and focus placed on the competition.
      While the potential negative consequences of stress for coaches and their
      athletes have been explored, relatively little is known about the factors
      underpinning successful Olympic coaching performance. We explored elite coaches' 
      perceptions of the factors that enable them to coach in a stressful Olympic
      environment. Eight coaches from one of Great Britain's most successful Olympic
      teams (i.e. consistent medal winners in the previous three Olympics) were
      interviewed. Inductive content analysis indicated that psychological attributes
      (e.g. emotional control), preparation (e.g. strategic approach), and coping at
      the event (e.g. team support) were factors that coaches perceived as important
      for successful Olympic coaching. In addition, coaches offered specific
      suggestions for training and development. Key themes included coach interaction
      (e.g. mentoring, formalizing contact) and simulating Olympic pressure. These
      findings offer suggestions for the education of developing coaches on the pathway
      to elite sports coaching.

TI  - Performance analysis in sport: contributions from a joint analysis of athletes'
      experience and biomechanical indicators.
PG  - 576-84
LID - 10.1111/j.1600-0838.2011.01421.x [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to test the usefulness of combining two types of
      analysis to investigate sports performance with the aim of optimizing it. These
      two types of analysis correspond to two levels of athletes' activity: (a) their
      experiences during performance and (b) the biomechanical characteristics of their
      movements. Rowing served as an illustration, and the activity of one female crew 
      member was studied during a race. Three types of data were collected: (a)
      audiovisual data recorded during the race; (b) verbalization data obtained in
      interviews conducted afterward; and (c) biomechanical data. The courses of
      experience of the two rowers during the race were reconstructed on the basis of
      the audiovisual and verbalization data. This paper presents a detailed analysis
      of a single phenomenon of the race experienced by one of the rowers. According to
      the coaches, it reflected a dysfunction in crew coordination. The aim of this
      analysis was to identify the biomechanical characteristics of the rowers'
      movements that might explain it. The results showed that the phenomenon could be 
      explained principally by an amplitude differential between the two rowers'
      strokes. On this basis, the coaches defined new training objectives to remedy the
      dysfunction in crew coordination.

TI  - Good practices and health policy analysis in European sports stadia: results from
      the 'Healthy Stadia' project.
PG  - 157-65
LID - 10.1093/heapro/dar088 [doi]
AB  - Sport plays an important role within society and sports stadia provide
      significant settings for public health strategies. In addition to being places of
      mass gathering, stadia are often located in less affluent areas and are
      traditionally attended by 'harder to reach' communities. Unfortunately sports
      stadia and the clubs they host are rarely perceived as places that promote
      healthy lifestyles. Fast food, alcohol and tobacco are commonly advertized,
      served and consumed during sports games giving the spectators and TV fans
      contradictory messages concerning healthy choices. As part of a wider programme
      of work part-funded by the European Union, a study was therefore designed to
      explore current 'good practice' relating to positive health interventions in
      sports stadia across a number of European countries. Using a specially designed
      questionnaire, information about health policies and good practices relating to
      food offerings in stadia, physical activity promotion among local communities,
      tobacco policy, positive mental health initiatives, environmental sustainability 
      practices and social responsibility policies were collected in 10 European
      countries (England and Northern Ireland, Finland, Georgia, Greece, Ireland,
      Italy, Latvia, Poland, Spain and Sweden) involving 88 stadia. The audit results
      show that stadia health policies differ considerably between specific countries
      and sports. Based on the literature analysed, the examples of good practices
      collected through the study, and the subsequent instigation of a European Healthy
      Stadia Network, it shows that there is considerable potential for stadia to
      become health promoting settings.

      regard to the effects of lung sports].
PG  - 751-5
LID - 10.1055/s-0031-1291437 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic diseases of the respiratory organs have, besides restrictions
      of lung function, also physical, mental and social consequences. The chronic
      disease impacts negatively not only the patient's own quality of life but also
      that of his/her partner and/or relative. As treatment modalities, besides drug
      therapy, above all outpatient rehabilitation measures have proved to be
      effective. In this pilot study we sought answers to three questions: (i) How is
      the quality of life of the patient's partner and/or relative influenced by the
      disease? How does the partner/relative assess the effect of the disease on the
      chronically ill patient? How does the partner/relative assess the effect of lung 
      sports on the chronically ill patient? METHODS: A specially conceived
      questionnaire was given to the partners/relatives of 25 patients with chronic
      pulmonary diseases. The patients, 23 with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      and 2 with pulmonary fibrosis, have been participating in lung sports once a week
      for more than three years. The average age of the patients was 67 years. RESULTS:
      The patients' illness also negatively influenced the quality of life of the
      partner to a considerable extent. The impact of the patients' pulmonary disease
      on the healthy partner was assessed as being rather moderate. Restrictions of
      social life were essentially influenced by the amount of assistance required by
      the pulmonary patient. The therapeutic effects of lung sports on the well-being
      of the patient were aways considered to be positive by the respective
      partner/relatives. CONCLUSION: A chronic pulmonary illness also has a negative
      influence on the partner/relative's quality of life. The necessity for extensive 
      assistance in daily life is accompanied by a considerable negative impact on the 
      partner's quality of life. According to the opinion of the partner/relative, lung
      sports have positive effects in all of the chronically ill patient's fields of
      life.

TI  - Investigating the use of stimulants in out-of-competition sport samples.
PG  - 613-6
AB  - The List of Prohibited Substances and Methods (the List), an International
      Standard published yearly by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), determines
      which substances and methods are prohibited in sport in- and out-of-competition. 
      Stimulants are included within drug class S.6 under the in-competition testing
      section of the List. Athletes may be tempted to use stimulants as ergogenic aids 
      in-competition in order to temporarily improve their mental and/or physical
      functions by increasing alertness, aggressiveness, motivation, locomotion, heart 
      rate, and reducing fatigue. The Prohibited List Expert Group, responsible for the
      maintenance of the List, approved WADA funding for a two-year study to determine 
      whether athletes were also using stimulants to benefit from their
      performance-enhancing effects during the training phase between competitions
      (i.e., out-of-competition). This study, involving 11 WADA-accredited
      laboratories, found that the use of stimulants by athletes during training was
      not significantly prevalent (0.36% of positive findings), suggesting that this
      issue does not, at the moment, pose a further challenge to the fight against
      doping in sport. In addition, the study supports the current structure in the
      Prohibited List that differentiates banned substances into the in- and
      out-of-competition classifications.

TI  - Affective infrastructures: toward a cultural neuropsychology of sport.
PG  - 4
LID - 10.3389/fnevo.2011.00004 [doi]
AB  - Recently there has been a turn toward considerations of embodiment, cognition,
      and context in sport studies. Many researchers have argued that the traditional
      focus on clinical psychology and performance enhancement within the discipline is
      incomplete, and now emphasize the importance of athletes' social and familial
      contexts in a research paradigm that examines interconnections between movement, 
      cognition, emotion, and the social and cultural context in which movement takes
      place. While it is important that the sport studies focus is being expanded to
      consider these interactions, I will argue that this model is still incomplete in 
      that it is missing a fundamental variable - that of our evolutionary
      neurobiological roots. I will use the work of affective neuroscientists Jaak
      Panksepp and Stephen Porges to show that because sport so clearly activates
      neural systems that function at both proximate and ultimate levels of causation, 
      it can be seen to serve fundamental needs for affective balance. A neurobiology
      of affect shows how the evolution of the mammalian autonomic nervous system has
      resulted in neurophysiological substrates for affective processes and stress
      responses, and has wide-ranging implications for sport studies in terms of
      suggesting what forms of coaching might be the most effective in what context. I 
      propose the term cultural neuropsychology of sport as a descriptor for a model
      that examines the relationships between neurophysiological substrates and
      athletes' social and familial contexts in terms of how these variables facilitate
      or fail to facilitate athletes' neuroceptions of safety, which in turn have a
      direct impact on their performance. A cultural neuropsychological model of sport 
      might thereby be seen to elaborate a relationship between proximate and ultimate 
      mechanisms in concretely applied ways.

AB  - Sports injuries are common in children and adolescents. Typical musculoskeletal
      disorders include overuse injuries such as stress fractures and apophyseal
      avulsions. Gymnastics has one of the highest injury rates of all girls' sports.
      Intensive gymnastics can cause chronic spine and wrist trauma. Prevention of
      sport injuries should be a priority for parents, coaches and children themselves.
      Protection (helmet, padding) is mandatory for some activities. Proper education
      and preparation are necessary for all sports activities.

PG  - 915-28
LID - S0124-00642010000600004 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed at investigating the anthropometrics
      characteristics of male Brazilian junior volleyball players, organised into 3
      sports requirement groups: high qualification (HQ) formed by the national team,
      middle qualification (MQ) formed by athletes playing in the Brazilian national
      championships and low qualification (LQ) formed by players at school level.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: 101 athletes were observed, HQ (n=16), MQ (n=68) and LQ
      (n=17), aged 16.7 +/- 0.5; 16.6 +/- 0.5 and 16.2 +/- 0.7 years, respectively.
      There following were evaluated: body mass, height, standing reach height, % body 
      fat and Heath & Carter somatotype. The statistical analysis was descriptive and
      inferential, the Kruskal Wallis test being used for detecting differences between
      groups (p<0.05 significance) and Spearman correlation coefficient for
      establishing association between anthropometric characteristics and requirement
      levels, considering p<0,05 e p<0.01 to be significant and highly significant,
      respectively. RESULTS: Significant differences (p<0.05) were detected between
      athlete groups for body mass, height, standing reach height and ectomorphy. A
      "strong" correlation for height and "regular" correlation for standing reach
      height, body mass and ectomorphy were observed, according to players' height or
      classification. CONCLUSIONS: The results gave normative data for athletes which
      will allow coaches and physical instructors to use such information during
      training as a sports' selection instrument for young talented volleyball players.

TI  - Is there a danger for myopia in anti-doping education? Comparative analysis of
      substance use and misuse in Olympic racket sports calls for a broader approach.
PG  - 27
LID - 10.1186/1747-597X-6-27 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Racket sports are typically not associated with doping. Despite the
      common characteristics of being non-contact and mostly individual, racket sports 
      differ in their physiological demands, which might be reflected in substance use 
      and misuse (SUM). The aim of this study was to investigate SUM among Slovenian
      Olympic racket sport players in the context of educational, sociodemographic and 
      sport-specific factors. METHODS: Elite athletes (N=187; mean age=22+/-2.3; 64%
      male) representing one of the three racket sports, table tennis, badminton, and
      tennis, completed a paper-and-pencil questionnaire on substance use habits.
      Athletes in this sample had participated in at least one of the two most recent
      competitions at the highest national level and had no significant difference in
      competitive achievement or status within their sport. RESULTS: A significant
      proportion of athletes (46% for both sexes) reported using nutritional
      supplements. Between 10% and 24% of the studied males would use doping if the
      practice would help them achieve better results in competition and if it had no
      negative health consequences; a further 5% to 10% indicated potential doping
      behaviour regardless of potential health hazards. Females were generally less
      oriented toward SUM than their male counterparts with no significant differences 
      between sports, except for badminton players. Substances that have no direct
      effect on sport performance (if timed carefully to avoid detrimental effects) are
      more commonly consumed (20% binge drink at least once a week and 18% report using
      opioids), whereas athletes avoid substances that can impair and threaten athletic
      achievement by decreasing physical capacities (e.g. cigarettes), violating
      anti-doping codes or potentially transgressing substance control laws (e.g.
      opiates and cannabinoids). Regarding doping issues, athletes' trust in their
      coaches and physicians is low. CONCLUSION: SUM in sports spreads beyond
      doping-prone sports and drugs that enhance athletic performance. Current
      anti-doping education, focusing exclusively on rules and fair play, creates an
      increasingly widening gap between sports and the athletes' lives outside of
      sports. To avoid myopia, anti-doping programmes should adopt a holistic approach 
      to prevent substance use in sports for the sake of the athletes' health as much
      as for the integrity of sports.

TI  - Sample size and power estimates for a confirmatory factor analytic model in
      exercise and sport: a Monte Carlo approach.
PG  - 412-23
AB  - Monte Carlo methods can be used in data analytic situations (e.g., validity
      studies) to make decisions about sample size and to estimate power. The purpose
      of using Monte Carlo methods in a validity study is to improve the methodological
      approach within a study where the primary focus is on construct validity issues
      and not on advancing statistical theory. The purpose of this study is to
      demonstrate how Monte Carlo methods can be used to determine sample size and to
      estimate power for a confirmatory factor analytic model under model-data
      conditions commonly encountered in exercise and sport. Because the purpose is
      pursued by way of demonstration with the Coaching Efficacy Scale II-High School
      Teams, related sample size recommendations are provided: N > or = 200 for the
      theoretical model; N > or = 300 for the population model. Technical terms (e.g., 
      coverage) are defined when necessary.

TI  - Football and post-war reintegration: exploring the role of sport in DDR processes
      in Sierra Leone.
PG  - 395-415
AB  - Growing enthusiasm for 'Sport for development and peace' (SDP) projects around
      the world has created a much greater interest among critical scholars seeking to 
      interrogate potential gains, extant limitations and challenges of using sport to 
      advance 'development' and 'peace' in Africa. Despite this interest, the role of
      sport in post-conflict peace building remains poorly understood. Since peace
      building, as a field of study, lends itself to practical approaches that seek to 
      address underlying sources of violent conflict, it is surprising that it has
      neglected to take an interest in sport, especially its grassroots models. In
      Africa, football (soccer) in particular has a strong appeal because of its
      popularity and ability to mobilise individuals and communities. Through a case
      study on Sierra Leone, this paper focuses on sports in a particularly prominent
      post-civil war UN intervention-the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration 
      (DDR) process-to determine how ex-youth combatants, camp administrators and
      caregivers perceive the role and significance of sporting activities in interim
      care centres (ICCS) or DDR camps. It argues that sporting experiences in ddr
      processes are fruitful microcosms for understanding nuanced forms of violence and
      healing among youth combatants during their reintegration process.

TI  - Do youth hockey coaches allow players with a known concussion to participate in a
      game?
PG  - 283-7
LID - 10.1177/0009922811422434 [doi]
AB  - Ice hockey is a high-risk sport for concussion. It is important that coaches have
      an understanding of concussion, although previous studies have demonstrated poor 
      knowledge of concussion recognition and management by youth coaches. A
      cross-sectional survey with 7 case scenarios was completed by 314 youth hockey
      coaches. Each case scenario described a player with a concussion during a game,
      and scores reflected how the coach would respond to each scenario. Although most 
      coaches would not allow a player to continue participating in a game after
      suffering a concussion, there was a small percentage that would. Statistical
      analysis found an inverse relationship between the coaches' age and consideration
      of continued participation. This places athletes at significant risk for further 
      injury and is not consistent with current concussion guidelines. USA Hockey
      should provide additional concussion training for their coaches as well as
      mandatory health care clearance following a concussion.

      sport programmes.
PG  - 793-800

AB  - Use of ball projection machines in the acquisition of interceptive skill has
      recently been questioned. The use of projection machines in developmental and
      elite fast ball sports programmes is not a trivial issue, since they play a
      crucial role in reducing injury incidence in players and coaches. A compelling
      challenge for sports science is to provide theoretical principles to guide 'how' 
      and 'when' projection machines might be used for acquisition of ball skills and
      preparation for competition in developmental and elite sport performance
      programmes. In this article, we propose how principles from an ecological
      dynamics theoretical framework could be adopted by sports scientists, pedagogues 
      and coaches to underpin the design of interventions, practice and training tasks,
      including the use of hybrid video-projection technologies. The assessment of
      representative learning design during practice may provide ways to optimize
      developmental programmes in fast ball sports and provide information on the
      principled use of ball projection machines.

TI  - The use of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the automated external defibrillator
      in the practice of sports physical therapy.
PG  - 267-70
AB  - During the initial assessment of the injured athlete, the Sports Physical
      Therapist (PT) must first be concerned with life-threatening emergencies such as 
      absence of breathing and pulse. The sports PT must also be aware of the
      possibility of "sudden cardiac death" that could occur in others, including
      coaches, officials, and fans. If the PT assumes the role of "most medical" person
      at the contest or event, the responsibility for life saving action falls squarely
      on their shoulders. Therefore, skills and ongoing certification in cardio-
      pulmonary resuscitation techniques and the use of an automated external
      defibrillator are a basic necessity. These skills are required as part of the
      specialty practice of sports PT (BLS Healthcare Provider course or CPR for the
      Professional Rescuer in addition to completion of the First Responder Course OR
      credentials as an EMT or ATC), and are mandatory for being qualified to sit for
      the exam to become a sports certified specialist (SCS) by the American Board of
      Physical Therapy Specialties (ABPTS).(3).

TI  - Management of acute sports injuries and medical conditions by physical
      therapists: assessment via case scenarios.
PG  - 158-72
AB  - PURPOSE/BACKGROUND: Some physical therapists (PTs) provide services at sporting
      events, but there are limited studies investigating whether PTs are properly
      prepared to provide such services. The purpose of this study was to assess acute 
      sports injury and medical condition management decision-making skills of PTs.
      METHODS: A Web-based survey presented 17 case scenarios related to acute medical 
      conditions and sport injuries. PTs from the Sports Physical Therapy Section of
      The American Physical Therapy Association were e-mailed a cover letter/Web link
      to the survey and invited to participate over a 30-day period. Data were analyzed
      using SPSS 18.0. RESULTS: A total of 411 of 5158 PTs who were members of the
      Sports Physical Therapy Association in 2009 and had valid e-mail addresses
      completed the survey, of which 389 (7.5%) were appropriate for analysis. Over
      75.0% of respondents felt "prepared" or "somewhat prepared" to provide immediate 
      care for 13 out of 16 medical conditions, with seizures, spinal cord injuries,
      and internal organ injuries having the lowest percentages. Over 75.0% of the
      respondents made "appropriate" or "overly cautious" decisions for 11 of the 17
      acute injury or medical condition cases. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the current
      study indicate that PTs felt more "prepared" and tended to make "appropriate"
      return to play decisions on the acute sports injury and medical condition case
      studies more often than coaches who participated in a similar study, regardless
      of level of importance of the game or whether the athlete was a starter vs.
      non-starter. However, for PTs who plan on assisting at sporting events,
      additional preparation/education may be recommended, such as what is taught in an
      emergency responder course.

AB  - Professional athletes are subject to massive somatic, social, and mental stress. 
      Despite great public interest for athletic achievements, the emotional strains
      thereof are very poorly investigated and discussed. The main reason for this is
      the widespread assumption that only emotionally very strong athletes are able to 
      compete at the highly professional level and therefore mental disorders do not
      exist in professional sports. But available research data about the prevalence of
      mental disorders in this area suggest that this hypothesis must be revised. With 
      respect to depression and the overtraining syndrome, attempts have been made to
      demonstrate the difficulties with etiology, diagnostics, and treatment for sports
      psychiatry and psychotherapy. Scientifically, sport psychiatry and psychotherapy 
      can be defined as a discipline, whose focus is the investigation, treatment, and 
      prevention of the extreme and sports-specific emotional strains and disorders. In
      addition to sport psychology, which focuses mainly on performance enhancement,
      mental stress, and disorders can hereby be recognized, disorders be treated and
      the athletic performance sustained. With the foundation of the Task Force for
      Sports Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the German Association for Psychiatry and 
      Psychotherapy, scientific research, further education, prevention, and treatment 
      for mental disorders in professional sports will be improved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Individuals who have knowledge on the importance of adequate and
      balanced diet and reflect this knowledge to their behaviors are considered to be 
      more successful in sports life. The present study aims to evaluate the nutrition 
      knowledge of students receiving sports education in universities. METHODS: The
      study sample consists of 343 voluntary students from the Sports Departments of
      Hacettepe, Gazi and Ankara Universities in Ankara. The questionnaire used in the 
      study included a demographic section, and 30 questions on true-false nutrition
      knowledge. For the reliability of the questionnaire, the internal consistency
      coefficient was calculated and the Kuder Richardson (KR-20) value was found to be
      0.71. For higher reliability, 9 dysfunctional questions were excluded from the
      questionnaire. The research data were collected through a questionnaire form and 
      face-to-face interviews. For the statistical analyses of the data, tables were
      prepared to show mean, standard deviation (X+/-SD) and percentage (%) values. In 
      order to determine the nutrition knowledge of students, the "independent t test" 
      was used for nutrition lesson and gender. RESULTS: University students receiving 
      sports education and expected to continue their professional lives on
      sport-related fields were determined to have the lack of knowledge on nutrition. 
      The mean value about the nutrition knowledge of the first year students was found
      11.150 +/- 2.962, while the mean value of the fourth year students was 13.460 +/-
      3.703, and the difference is statistically significant (p = .000). CONCLUSION:
      Students, coaches and teachers in physical education were found not to give the
      necessary importance to their diets, and they were still not aware of the
      importance of nutrition on performance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Children's exposure to unhealthy food marketing influences their food
      knowledge, preferences and consumption. Sport sponsorship by food companies is
      widespread and industry investment in this marketing is increasing. This study
      aimed to assess children's awareness of sport sponsors and their brand-related
      attitudes and purchasing intentions in response to this marketing. METHODS:
      Sports clubs known to have food sponsors and representing the most popular sports
      for Australian children across a range of demographic areas were recruited.
      Interview-based questionnaires were conducted at clubs with children aged 10-14
      years (n = 103) to examine their recall of local sports club and elite sport
      sponsors, and their attitudes towards sponsors and sponsorship activities.
      RESULTS: Most children (68%) could recall sponsors of their sports club, naming a
      median of two sponsors, including a median of one food company sponsor each.
      Almost half (47%) of children could recall any sponsors of their favourite elite 
      sporting team. Children aged 10-11 years were more likely than older children to 
      report that they thought about sponsors when buying something to eat or drink (P 
      < 0.01); that they liked to return the favour to sponsors by buying their
      products (P < 0.01); and that sponsors were 'cool' (P = 0.02). Most children had 
      received a voucher or certificate from a food or beverage company to reward sport
      performance (86% and 76%, respectively). Around one-third of children reported
      liking the company more after receiving these rewards. CONCLUSIONS: Children's
      high recall of food and beverage company sport sponsors and their positive
      attitudes towards these sponsors and their promotions is concerning as this is
      likely to be linked to children's food preferences and consumption. Limiting
      children's exposure to this marketing is an important initiative to improve
      children's nutrition.

TI  - Concepts of neurodevelopment in sports activity for adolescents.
PG  - 7-12
AB  - This article highlights comments on this question for both teenager and parent,
      focusing on key underlying concepts as neurodevelopment and sports readiness.
      Issues regarding neurodevelopment in adolescent sports are considered in this
      article. Understanding the neurodevelopment of the Adolescent Athlete and how
      this development impacts sports participation is critical for clinicians to
      provide parents, coaches, and sports organizers with valuable information about
      how to select activities for their children that will have a positive impact on
      their overall growth and development as well as optimize their benefit from
      sports play. Stories of child prodigies who began to learn a specific sport
      before age three stimulate parents to question whether or not they also should be
      enrolling their very young children in such aggressive training programs.
      Physicians and health care sports professionals should provide information to
      other professionals and parents about issues related to successful sports
      participation of the pediatric athlete, both as a child and as an adolescent.

TI  - Knowledge of eating disorders among collegiate administrators, coaches, and
      auxiliary dancers.
PG  - 951-8
AB  - Knowledge of eating disorders, confidence in knowledge, and attendance of eating 
      disorder educational programs were assessed among NCAA Division I and II
      university administrators (n = 61), coaches (n = 44), and dancers (n = 53). A
      questionnaire assessed knowledge in 5 domains: etiology, signs and symptoms,
      management and treatment, risk factors, and prevention and education. Overall,
      dancers' knowledge and previous attendance were significantly lower than
      administrators' and coaches'. There was inconsistency between participants'
      confidence in answers and the correctness of their answers. Education is
      necessary for improving knowledge and reducing risky behaviors in auxiliary
      dancers.

      apparatus].
PG  - 1103-7
LID - 10.1055/s-0031-1273401 [doi]
AB  - AIM OF STUDY: In particular, in the quick ball and racket games a good dynamic
      seeing is required . The afferent dynamic seeing occurs via the retiina which
      mediates the stimuli for efferent dynamic seeing . The aim of this study was to
      examine the dynamic visual acuity of sportsmen from sports with different demands
      on their dynamic seeing (DS). METHODS: 19 sports students took part in the study.
      10 subjects participated in coached team sports (group I) and 9 remaining
      performed individual sports (group II). The DS was assessed by means of the
      Dusseldorfer test for dynamic seeing of Wist which was performed twice on one
      day. RESULTS: The DS of the two groups in the first study did not differ (right
      eye 95.7 +/- 10.6 % in group I vs. 94.3 +/- 6.9 % in group II and left eye 97.6
      +/- 4.8 % vs. 95.3 +/- 5.6 %; p >/= 0.05). Also the second study there was no
      different in DS for the two groups (right eye 98.3 +/- 2.6 % vs. 93.8 +/- 8.0 %
      and left eye 99.3 +/- 1.2 % vs. 95.6 +/- 7.0 %; p >/= 0.05). DISCUSSION: Our
      hypothesis about a different DS in players of ball games compared with non-ball
      sport players could not be proved. It is to be critically noted that a
      generalization is not possible due to the small sample numbers. Because DS is a
      necessary precondition in ball games further studies should be concentrated on
      its trainability.

PG  - S115-25
LID - 10.1080/02640414.2011.605459 [doi]
AB  - Implementation of a nutrition programme for team sports involves application of
      scientific research together with the social skills necessary to work with a
      sports medicine and coaching staff. Both field and court team sports are
      characterized by intermittent activity requiring a heavy reliance on dietary
      carbohydrate sources to maintain and replenish glycogen. Energy and substrate
      demands are high during pre-season training and matches, and moderate during
      training in the competitive season. Dietary planning must include enough
      carbohydrate on a moderate energy budget, while also meeting protein needs.
      Strength and power team sports require muscle-building programmes that must be
      accompanied by adequate nutrition, and simple anthropometric measurements can
      help the nutrition practitioner monitor and assess body composition periodically.
      Use of a body mass scale and a urine specific gravity refractometer can help
      identify athletes prone to dehydration. Sports beverages and caffeine are the
      most common supplements, while opinion on the practical effectiveness of creatine
      is divided. Late-maturing adolescent athletes become concerned about gaining size
      and muscle, and assessment of maturity status can be carried out with
      anthropometric procedures. An overriding consideration is that an individual
      approach is needed to meet each athlete's nutritional needs.

TI  - Validation of the short form-36 health survey supported with isokinetic strength 
      testing after sport knee injury.
PG  - 261-76
AB  - CONTEXT: Valid patient-based outcome instruments are necessary for comprehensive 
      patient care that focuses on all aspects of health, from impairments to
      participation restrictions. OBJECTIVE: To validate the Slovenian translation of
      Medical Outcome Survey (MOS) Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and to assess
      relations among various knee measurements, activity tested with Oxford Knee Score
      (OKS) and health-related quality of life as estimated with SF-36 domains. DESIGN:
      Descriptive validation study. SETTING: Isokinetic laboratory in outpatient
      rehabilitation unit. PARTICIPANTS: 101 subjects after unilateral sport knee
      injury. INTERVENTIONS: All subjects completed the SF-36 and OKS, and isokinetic
      knee-muscle strength output at 60 degrees /s was determined in 78 participants.
      Within a 3-d period, 43 subjects completed the SF-36 and OKS questionnaires
      again. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Reliability testing included internal consistency
      and test-retest reliability. Correlations between SF-36 subscales and OKS were
      calculated to assess construct validity, and correlation between SF-36 subscales 
      and muscle strength was calculated to assess concurrent validity. RESULTS:
      Chronbach alpha was above .78 for all SF-36 subscales. ICCs ranged from .80 to
      .93. The correlation between OKS and the physical-functioning subscale, showing
      convergent construct validity, was higher (r = .83, P < .01) than between OKS and
      mental health (r = .50, P < .01), showing divergent construct validity.
      Knee-extensor weakness negatively correlated with physical-functioning (r = -.59,
      P < .01) and social-functioning (r = -.43, P < .01) subscales. CONCLUSIONS: The
      Slovenian translation of the SF-36 is a reliable and valuable tool. The
      relationships between knee-muscle strength and activity and between knee-muscle
      strength and SF-36 subscales in patients after sport knee injury were
      established.

TI  - Prosocial and antisocial behavior in sport: the role of coaching style,
      autonomous vs. controlled motivation, and moral disengagement.
PG  - 527-47
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine whether the relationships between
      contextual factors (i.e., autonomy-supportive vs. controlling coaching style) and
      person factors (i.e., autonomous vs. controlled motivation) outlined in
      self-determination theory (SDT) were related to prosocial and antisocial
      behaviors in sport. We also investigated moral disengagement as a mediator of
      these relationships. Athletes' (n = 292, M = 19.53 years) responses largely
      supported our SDT-derived hypotheses. Results indicated that an
      autonomy-supportive coaching style was associated with prosocial behavior toward 
      teammates; this relationship was mediated by autonomous motivation. Controlled
      motivation was associated with antisocial behavior toward teammates and
      antisocial behavior toward opponents, and these two relationships were mediated
      by moral disengagement. The results provide support for research investigating
      the effect of autonomy-supportive coaching interventions on athletes' prosocial
      and antisocial behavior.

TI  - Nonfatal sports and recreation heat illness treated in hospital emergency
      departments--United States, 2001-2009.
PG  - 977-80
AB  - Although heat illness is recognized as a leading cause of death and disability
      during participation in U.S. high school and collegiate athletics, the incidence 
      of heat illness among younger children and adults participating in sports and
      recreational activities is unknown. To examine the incidence and characteristics 
      of nonfatal sports and recreation heat illness among persons of all ages, CDC
      analyzed 2001-2009 data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance
      System--All Injury Program. This report describes the results of that analysis,
      which found that an estimated 5,946 persons were treated in U.S. emergency
      departments (EDs) each year for a heat illness sustained while participating in a
      sport or recreational activity, for an estimated annual rate of 2.0 ED visits per
      100,000 population. Incidence was highest among males (72.5%) and among those
      aged 15-19 years (35.6%), and 7.1% of patients were hospitalized. These findings 
      highlight the need for effective heat illness prevention messages to target all
      persons who are physically active, including those who participate in
      unstructured sports and recreational activities. Specific emphasis should be
      placed on targeting appropriate prevention messages toward those aged 15-19
      years, who are at greatest risk, and their coaches and parents.

TI  - A longitudinal examination of coach and peer motivational climates in youth
      sport: implications for moral attitudes, well-being, and behavioral investment.
PG  - 213-23
LID - 10.1037/a0024934 [doi]
AB  - Embedded in achievement goal theory (Ames, 1992; Meece, Anderman, & Anderman,
      2006), this study examined how perceptions of coach and peer motivational climate
      in youth sport predicted moral attitudes, emotional well-being, and indices of
      behavioral investment in a sample of British adolescents competing in regional
      leagues. We adopted a longitudinal perspective, taking measures at the middle and
      the end of a sport season, as well as at the beginning of the following season.
      Multilevel modeling analyses showed that perceptions of task-involving peer and
      coach climates were predictive of more adaptive outcomes than were perceptions of
      ego-involving peer and coach climates. Predictive effects differed as a function 
      of time and outcome variable under investigation. The results indicate the
      importance of considering peer influence in addition to coach influence when
      examining motivational climate in youth sport.

TI  - Burnout among judo coaches in Turkey.
PG  - 365-70
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of
      professional burnout experienced by Turkish judo coaches and to compare possible 
      differences in the three burnout dimensions based on coaching experience in years
      and satisfaction status of their sport administrators. METHODS: The data were
      obtained by using a three-section questionnaire including a socio demographic
      data form and the Turkish version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory from 65 judo
      coaches working in the Turkish Judo and Kurash Federation. RESULTS: In the
      analysis of data, descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation) and
      one-way ANOVA tests were used. This study showed that judo coaches have medium
      level burnout experience. The results also showed that there were significant
      differences in the emotional exhaustion levels of judo coaches based on coaching 
      experience in years and satisfaction status from their sport administrators.
      CONCLUSIONS: Burnout appears to be a problematic issue for judo coaches. When
      coaches begin to feel emotionally depleted, they distance themselves from
      athletes, and experience a reduced sense of meaning about their work; it is
      likely to affect the quality of the athletic experience for both the coach and
      the athletes.

TI  - Sport participation during adolescence and suicide ideation and attempts.
PG  - 3-10
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most research regarding sport participation and suicide risk found
      protective relationships. However, all studies in this area were based on
      cross-sectional designs. OBJECTIVE: To fill a gap in research by exploring
      associations between sport involvement and suicide ideation and attempts
      (suicidality) based on a 5-year longitudinal, population-based study. STUDY
      GROUP: Participants (n = 739) completed surveys in middle school and high school.
      METHODS: Logistic regression analysis compared suicidality during high school
      across four groups: youth who participated in sport in both middle and high
      school, youth who participated only in middle school or only in high school, and 
      youth who did not participate in sport during adolescence. RESULTS: Compared to
      non-participants, youth involved in sport in both middle and high school had
      lower odds of suicidal ideation during high school. Youth who discontinued sport 
      after middle school had higher odds of attempting suicide during high school than
      non-participants. CONCLUSIONS: Remaining involved in sport throughout adolescence
      can offer mental health benefits. Future research should identify mechanisms that
      account for protective relationships between involvement in sport throughout
      adolescence and suicidality, and identify factors that explain deleterious
      relationships for youth who discontinue sport early in adolescence.

TI  - Excellence in coaching: the art and skill of elite practitioners.
PG  - 229-38
AB  - During this study, 10 expert coaches were interviewed to examine their views on
      aspects of their individual coaching practice. Four themes emerged from the
      interviews: (a) the long-term approach, (b) the authentic coaching environment,
      (c) creating a learning environment, and (d) the quality and quantity of training
      sessions. These coaches were consistent in their attempts to facilitate learning 
      experiences for the athletes, while setting high standards in both training and
      competition. The study's findings show that expert coaches have to orchestrate a 
      large number of variables when planning and executing a training session, and
      their success depends on their coaching knowledge and their skill at
      contextualizing the necessary components for specific situations.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate minor hockey coaches'
      knowledge base of sport-related concussions. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey.
      SETTING: Subjects independently completed the written survey at preseason
      organizational meetings. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred seventy-eight active coaches
      spanning 5 age levels (ages 5-15 years). Coaches reported 2.62 +/- 3.73 years of 
      coaching experience. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Resources where coaches obtained
      information about concussions, perceptions of variables associated with
      concussions, knowledge level of issues associated with concussions, and
      decision-making practices. RESULTS: Newspapers and magazines were the most
      frequent source of information regarding concussions, yet were rated as not very 
      helpful. Family physicians were less frequently sought but were rated as most
      helpful. A majority of coaches reported limited knowledge about concussions but
      rated this knowledge as being important. There was a significant relationship
      between head coaching experience and concussion knowledge [R = 0.09, F3,156 =
      4.41, P = 0.005]. Most coaches demonstrated a good knowledge base of common
      issues associated with concussions, and a majority of individuals correctly
      identified return-to-play practices. CONCLUSIONS: A majority of minor hockey
      coaches correctly recognized and understood issues related to sport-related
      concussions. Results suggested that knowledge translation through various formal 
      and informal sources has had a positive effect. However, a majority of coaches
      reported having limited knowledge about concussions yet consider it an important 
      topic.

TI  - Prediction of intrinsic motivation and sports performance using 2 x 2 achievement
      goal framework.
PG  - 625-37
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of 2 x 2 achievement goals
      on intrinsic motivation and performance in handball. Participants were 164 high
      school athletes. All completed the 2 x 2 Achievement Goals Questionnaire for
      Sport and the Intrinsic Motivation subscale of the Sport Motivation Scale; the
      coach for each team rated his athletes' overall sports performance. Using
      simultaneous-regression analyses, mastery-approach goals positively predicted
      both intrinsic motivation and performance in sports, whereas
      performance-avoidance goals negatively predicted sports performance. These
      results suggest that athletes who pursue task mastery and improvement of their
      competence perform well and enjoy their participation. In contrast, those who
      focus on avoiding normative incompetence perform poorly.

TI  - National Athletic Trainers' Association position statement: safe weight loss and 
      maintenance practices in sport and exercise.
PG  - 322-36
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present athletic trainers with recommendations for safe weight loss
      and weight maintenance practices for athletes and active clients and to provide
      athletes, clients, coaches, and parents with safe guidelines that will allow
      athletes and clients to achieve and maintain weight and body composition goals.
      BACKGROUND: Unsafe weight management practices can compromise athletic
      performance and negatively affect health. Athletes and clients often attempt to
      lose weight by not eating, limiting caloric or specific nutrients from the diet, 
      engaging in pathogenic weight control behaviors, and restricting fluids. These
      people often respond to pressures of the sport or activity, coaches, peers, or
      parents by adopting negative body images and unsafe practices to maintain an
      ideal body composition for the activity. We provide athletic trainers with
      recommendations for safe weight loss and weight maintenance in sport and
      exercise. Although safe weight gain is also a concern for athletic trainers and
      their athletes and clients, that topic is outside the scope of this position
      statement. RECOMMENDATIONS: Athletic trainers are often the source of nutrition
      information for athletes and clients; therefore, they must have knowledge of
      proper nutrition, weight management practices, and methods to change body
      composition. Body composition assessments should be done in the most
      scientifically appropriate manner possible. Reasonable and individualized weight 
      and body composition goals should be identified by appropriately trained health
      care personnel (eg, athletic trainers, registered dietitians, physicians). In
      keeping with the American Dietetics Association (ADA) preferred nomenclature,
      this document uses the terms registered dietitian or dietician when referring to 
      a food and nutrition expert who has met the academic and professional
      requirements specified by the ADA's Commission on Accreditation for Dietetics
      Education. In some cases, a registered nutritionist may have equivalent
      credentials and be the commonly used term. All weight management and exercise
      protocols used to achieve these goals should be safe and based on the most
      current evidence. Athletes, clients, parents, and coaches should be educated on
      how to determine safe weight and body composition so that athletes and clients
      more safely achieve competitive weights that will meet sport and activity
      requirements while also allowing them to meet their energy and nutritional needs 
      for optimal health and performance.

TI  - Perception of coaching behaviors, coping, and achievement in a sport competition.
PG  - 460-8
AB  - This study examined the relationship between perceived coaching behaviors, coping
      strategies during a sport competition, and sport achievement. A prospective
      design was used in which 80 athletes from individual sports completed measures of
      perceived coaching behaviors two days before a competition (Time 1) and measures 
      of coping and sport achievement within three hours after a sport competition
      (Time 2). As expected, results of multiple regressions indicated that supportive 
      coaching was a positive predictor of task-oriented coping and sport achievement
      whereas unsupportive coaching was a positive predictor of disengagement-oriented 
      coping. Both types of coping were significantly associated with sport
      achievement. Task-oriented coping was a significant partial mediator in the
      relation between supportive coaching and sport achievement. This study, which
      contributes to both the coaching and coping literatures, highlights the role of
      supportive coaching behaviors in the initiation of effective stress management
      during sport competitions.

TI  - Tripartite efficacy profiles: a cluster analytic investigation of athletes'
      perceptions of their relationship with their coach.
PG  - 394-415
AB  - Recent studies of coach-athlete interaction have explored the bivariate
      relationships between each of the tripartite efficacy constructs (self-efficacy; 
      other-efficacy; relation-inferred self-efficacy, or RISE) and various indicators 
      of relationship quality. This investigation adopted an alternative approach by
      using cluster analyses to identify tripartite efficacy profiles within a sample
      of 377 individual sport athletes (Mage = 20.25, SD = 2.12), and examined how
      individuals in each cluster group differed in their perceptions about their
      relationship with their coach (i.e., commitment, satisfaction, conflict). Four
      clusters emerged: High (n = 128), Moderate (n = 95), and Low (n = 78) profiles,
      in which athletes reported relatively high, moderate, or low scores across all
      tripartite perceptions, respectively, as well as an Unfulfilled profile (n = 76) 
      in which athletes held relatively high self-efficacy, but perceived lower levels 
      of other-efficacy and RISE. Multivariate analyses revealed differences between
      the clusters on all relationship variables that were in line with theory. These
      results underscore the utility of considering synergistic issues in the
      examination of the tripartite efficacy framework.

AB  - This article reviews psychiatric/psychological issues in the athletic training
      room, including recognition of these issues and a framework for management.
      Because the majority of research has been conducted in college settings, most of 
      the issues discussed are presented in the context of college sports, although the
      results generalize to other athletic arenas. Greater awareness of psychological
      issues, empirical research, and education about mental health issues in the
      sports medicine community are clearly needed.

TI  - Invited clinical suggestion: "on the sidelines"- emergency care basics for the
      sports physical therapist.
PG  - 59-62
AB  - An integral part of the responsibilities of the sports physical therapist is
      emergency care that is provided on the sidelines and courtside during athletic
      events. Often times, the sports physical therapist is the "most medical"
      individual present at athletic events, especially at high school, middle school, 
      and club level events. The sports physical therapist is looked upon to provide
      appropriate care in the event of an injury to or sudden illness of an athlete, or
      in the event of an unexpected medical emergency that arises in members of the
      coaching staff, officials, and fans.

      injuries and enhance health in youth?
PG  - 155-66
LID - 10.1249/JSR.0b013e31821b1442 [doi]
AB  - Regular participation in organized youth sports does not ensure adequate exposure
      to skill- and health-related fitness activities, and sport training without
      preparatory conditioning does not appear to reduce risk of injury in young
      athletes. Current trends indicate that widespread participation in organized
      youth sports is occurring at a younger age, especially in girls. Current public
      health recommendations developed to promote muscle strengthening and bone
      building activities for youth aged 6 yr and older, along with increased
      involvement in competitive sport activities at younger ages, has increased
      interest and concern from parents, clinicians, coaches, and teachers regarding
      the optimal age to encourage and integrate more specialized physical training
      into youth development programs. This review synthesizes the latest literature
      and expert opinion regarding when to initiate neuromuscular conditioning in youth
      and presents a how-to integrative training conceptual model that could maximize
      the potential health-related benefits for children by reducing sports-related
      injury risk and encouraging lifelong, regular physical activity.

TI  - Eating disordered behaviours in Portuguese athletes: the influence of personal,
      sport, and psychological variables.
PG  - 190-200
LID - 10.1002/erv.1113 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study describes eating disordered behaviours in a sample of
      Portuguese elite athletes and analyses the impact of personal and sports factors 
      on those eating disordered behaviours. METHOD: Two hundred and ninety athletes
      (51.7% males) practicing collective (64.8%) and individual sports have been
      included. The evaluation protocol included the Eating Disorder Examination
      Questionnaire; the Sport Condition Questionnaire; the Sport Anxiety Scale; the
      Task and Ego Orientation in Sport Questionnaire; the Cognitive Evaluation of
      Sport-Threat Perceptions and the Self-Presentation Exercise Questionnaire.
      RESULTS: Females, athletes with a higher body mass index, and those with a desire
      to weigh less, reported more eating disordered behaviours. No relation with
      sports variables was found. Finally, a higher prevalence of eating disorders
      behaviour was predicted by lower satisfaction in terms of body shape and physical
      appearance, higher anxiety and impression motivation. CONCLUSION: Personal
      characteristics of athletes, as well as their body satisfaction, anxiety,
      impression motivation and threat perception and coach comments on their weight,
      represent dimensions that could raise the risk for eating disorders.

TI  - Antecedents of perceived coach autonomy supportive and controlling behaviors:
      coach psychological need satisfaction and well-being.
PG  - 255-72
AB  - Within the self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 2000) framework, research has 
      considered the consequences of coaches' autonomy supportive and controlling
      behaviors on various athlete outcomes (e.g., motivation and performance). The
      antecedents of such behaviors, however, have received little attention. Coaches
      (N = 443) from a variety of sports and competitive levels completed a self-report
      questionnaire to assess their psychological need satisfaction, well-being and
      perceived interpersonal behaviors toward their athletes. Structural equation
      modeling demonstrated that coaches' competence and autonomy need satisfaction
      positively predicted their levels of psychological well-being, as indexed by
      positive affect and subjective vitality. In turn, coaches' psychological
      well-being positively predicted their perceived autonomy support toward their
      athletes, and negatively predicted their perceived controlling behaviors.
      Overall, the results highlight the importance of coaching contexts that
      facilitate coaches' psychological need satisfaction and well-being, thereby
      increasing the likelihood of adaptive coach interpersonal behavior toward
      athletes.

PG  - 1341-9
LID - 10.1177/0363546511402807 [doi]
AB  - Groin injuries are a common occurrence in elite-level athletes. These injuries
      can cause significant pain and disability, leading to prolonged periods of
      inactivity and consternation among athletes, coaches, athletic trainers, and
      physicians alike. The differential diagnosis for groin pain is vast and spans
      multiple disciplines, including orthopaedics, general surgery, urology,
      gynecology, and neurology. Sports hernias are one cause of chronic groin pain in 
      athletes and are distinct entities from classic hernias. They are often caused by
      a deficient posterior wall of the inguinal canal, but may also involve concurrent
      injuries, such as conjoint and adductor tendinopathies and nerve entrapment.
      Understanding the complex lower abdominal, pelvic, and hip anatomy and
      pathophysiology of sports hernias is crucial to making an accurate diagnosis and 
      providing appropriate treatment options. Newer, less invasive surgical repair
      techniques show promising early results in improving pain and decreasing recovery
      time.

AB  - The use of dieting, rapid weight loss, and frequent weight fluctuation among
      athletes competing in weight-class and leanness sports have been considered a
      problem for years, but the extent of the problem and the health and performance
      consequences have yet to be fully examined. Most studies examining these issues
      have had weak methodology. However, results from this review indicate that a high
      proportion of athletes are using extreme weight-control methods and that the
      rules of some sports might be associated with the risk of continuous dieting,
      energy deficit, and/or use of extreme weight-loss methods that can be detrimental
      to health and performance. Thus, preventive strategies are justified for medical 
      as well as performance reasons. The most urgent needs are: (1) to develop
      sport-specific educational programmes for athletic trainers, coaches, and
      athletes; (2) modifications to regulations; and (3) research related to minimum
      percentage body fat and judging patterns.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate and review the literature regarding sports-related eye
      injuries and prevention through appropriate protective eyewear. METHODS: The
      literature was reviewed regarding sports-related eye injuries and prevention of
      these injuries. RESULTS: The review of the literature suggests that ocular sports
      injuries can occur with all sports and affects all ages. These injuries may
      affect professional athletes and amateur athletes around the world. There are
      between 40,000 and 600,000 documented sports-related ocular injuries in the
      United States every year. More than 90% of these ocular injuries from sports are 
      preventable. CONCLUSIONS: Most of sports-related eye injuries are preventable.
      Increased recognition of the risks of eye injury playing sports may lead to
      improved protection and a decreased morbidity from eye injuries. To help prevent 
      sports-related eye injuries, education of athletes, parents, coaches, trainers,
      referees, and health care practitioners is critical.

TI  - Where are the women in women's sports? Predictors of female athletes' interest in
      a coaching career.
PG  - 109-17
AB  - In this study, we used social cognitive career theory (Lent, Brown, & Hackett,
      1994) to examine the development of female athletes' career interest in coaching 
      and, specifically, the impact of contextual factors (female coaching role models,
      working hours, and perceived discrimination) on coaching self-efficacy and
      outcome expectations. Participants were 205 predominantly White, heterosexual
      female student athletes. A path analysis indicated that role models and working
      hours predicted coaching self-efficacy, which predicted coaching outcome
      expectations. Additionally, coaching self-efficacy, coaching outcome
      expectations, and contextual factors predicted coaching interest. Practical
      implications are discussed as well as suggestions for further research in this
      relatively unexplored area.

TI  - Proposed modifications to the conceptual model of coaching efficacy and
      additional validity evidence for the Coaching Efficacy Scale II-High School
      Teams.
PG  - 79-88
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether theoretically relevant sources
      of coaching efficacy could predict the measures derived from the Coaching
      Efficacy Scale II-High School Teams (CES II-HST). Data were collected from head
      coaches of high school teams in the United States (N=799). The analytic framework
      was a multiple-group confirmatory factor analysis with ordered-categorical
      indicators and observed covariates. Applying this framework to the conceptual
      model of coaching efficacy (CMCE) resulted in a statistical model equivalent to a
      multiple-group multivariate regression with latent outcomes. Results provided
      evidence for the ability of measures derived from the CES II-HST to be predicted 
      by theoretically relevant sources of coaching efficacy and suggested
      modifications to the CMCE.

TI  - The role of athlete narcissism in moderating the relationship between coaches'
      transformational leader behaviors and athlete motivation.
PG  - 3-19
AB  - Leadership research that examines follower characteristics as a potential
      moderator of leadership effectiveness is lacking. Within Bass's (1985)
      transformational leadership framework, we examined follower narcissism as a
      moderator of the coach behavior-coach effectiveness relationship. Youth athletes 
      (male = 103, female = 106) from the Singapore Sports Academy (mean age = 14.28,
      SD = 1.40 years) completed the Differentiated Transformational Leadership
      Inventory (Callow, Smith, Hardy, Arthur, & Hardy, 2009), the Narcissistic
      Personality Inventory (Raskin & Terry, 1988), and indices of follower effort.
      Multilevel analyses revealed that athlete narcissism moderated the relationship
      between fostering acceptance of group goals and athlete effort and between high
      performance expectations and athlete effort. All the other transformational
      leader behaviors demonstrated main effects on follower effort, except for
      inspirational motivation.

TI  - Interactive processes link the multiple symptoms of fatigue in sport competition.
PG  - 307-28
LID - 10.2165/11586070-000000000-00000 [doi]
AB  - Muscle physiologists often describe fatigue simply as a decline of muscle force
      and infer this causes an athlete to slow down. In contrast, exercise scientists
      describe fatigue during sport competition more holistically as an
      exercise-induced impairment of performance. The aim of this review is to
      reconcile the different views by evaluating the many performance
      symptoms/measures and mechanisms of fatigue. We describe how fatigue is assessed 
      with muscle, exercise or competition performance measures. Muscle performance
      (single muscle test measures) declines due to peripheral fatigue (reduced muscle 
      cell force) and/or central fatigue (reduced motor drive from the CNS). Peak
      muscle force seldom falls by >30% during sport but is often exacerbated during
      electrical stimulation and laboratory exercise tasks. Exercise performance
      (whole-body exercise test measures) reveals impaired physical/technical abilities
      and subjective fatigue sensations. Exercise intensity is initially sustained by
      recruitment of new motor units and help from synergistic muscles before it
      declines. Technique/motor skill execution deviates as exercise proceeds to
      maintain outcomes before they deteriorate, e.g. reduced accuracy or velocity. The
      sensation of fatigue incorporates an elevated rating of perceived exertion (RPE) 
      during submaximal tasks, due to a combination of peripheral and higher CNS
      inputs. Competition performance (sport symptoms) is affected more by
      decision-making and psychological aspects, since there are opponents and a
      greater importance on the result. Laboratory based decision making is generally
      faster or unimpaired. Motivation, self-efficacy and anxiety can change during
      exercise to modify RPE and, hence, alter physical performance. Symptoms of
      fatigue during racing, team-game or racquet sports are largely anecdotal, but
      sometimes assessed with time-motion analysis. Fatigue during brief all-out racing
      is described biomechanically as a decline of peak velocity, along with altered
      kinematic components. Longer sport events involve pacing strategies, central and 
      peripheral fatigue contributions and elevated RPE. During match play, the work
      rate can decline late in a match (or tournament) and/or transiently after intense
      exercise bursts. Repeated sprint ability, agility and leg strength become
      slightly impaired. Technique outcomes, such as velocity and accuracy for
      throwing, passing, hitting and kicking, can deteriorate. Physical and subjective 
      changes are both less severe in real rather than simulated sport activities.
      Little objective evidence exists to support exercise-induced mental lapses during
      sport. A model depicting mind-body interactions during sport competition shows
      that the RPE centre-motor cortex-working muscle sequence drives overall
      performance levels and, hence, fatigue symptoms. The sporting outputs from this
      sequence can be modulated by interactions with muscle afferent and circulatory
      feedback, psychological and decision-making inputs. Importantly, compensatory
      processes exist at many levels to protect against performance decrements. Small
      changes of putative fatigue factors can also be protective. We show that
      individual fatigue factors including diminished carbohydrate availability,
      elevated serotonin, hypoxia, acidosis, hyperkalaemia, hyperthermia, dehydration
      and reactive oxygen species, each contribute to several fatigue symptoms. Thus,
      multiple symptoms of fatigue can occur simultaneously and the underlying
      mechanisms overlap and interact. Based on this understanding, we reinforce the
      proposal that fatigue is best described globally as an exercise-induced decline
      of performance as this is inclusive of all viewpoints.

      climates upon athletes' perfectionistic cognitions.
PG  - 661-71

AB  - The aims of this study are threefold. First, we investigate the influence of the 
      parent-initiated motivational climate upon elite junior athletes' perfectionistic
      cognitions. Second, we examine whether the coach-created motivational climate
      predicts additional variance in elite junior athletes' perfectionistic cognitions
      beyond the effects associated with the parent-initiated motivational climate.
      Third, we test the moderating role of athletes' gender and age in the
      relationship between the parent-initiated and coach-created motivational climates
      and athletes' perfectionistic cognitions. A total of 190 elite junior athletes
      (mean age 15.2 years, s = 1.5, range 10-18) completed the Parent-Initiated
      Motivational Climate Questionnaire-2 (White & Duda, 1993), the Perceived
      Motivational Climate in Sport Questionnaire-2 (Newton, Duda, & Yin, 2000), and
      the Perfectionistic Cognitions Inventory (Flett, Hewitt, Blankstein, & Gray,
      1998). Regression analyses revealed that mother- and father-initiated
      worry-conducive climates, the father-initiated success-without-effort climate,
      and the coach-created performance motivational climate predicted male athletes'
      perfectionistic cognitions. Female athletes' perfectionistic cognitions were
      predicted by the mother-initiated worry-conducive climate, father-initiated
      learning-enjoyment climate, and both dimensions of the coach-created climate.
      Finally, athletes' gender emerged as a significant moderator of the
      mother-initiated worry-conducive climate and athletes' perfectionistic cognitions
      relationship. Findings confirm that the parent-initiated motivational climate is 
      a significant predictor of athletes' perfectionism-related thoughts, and provide 
      initial support for the influence of the coach-created motivation climate over
      children's perfectionistic cognitions.

AB  - The purposes of this study were to assess the relative impact of social
      influences initiated by coach, parents, and peers on children and adolescent
      athletes' motivational patterns, involving self-rated effort, enjoyment,
      competence, and competitive trait anxiety. Questionnaire data were collected from
      408 youth swimmers (aged 9-18 years). Results of multi-group structural equation 
      modeling analyses generally showed that compared with athletes in the other age
      group, the social influence from mother was stronger in childhood (mean age=10.87
      years; SD=1.00), and that from peers was greater in adolescence (mean age=16.32
      years; SD=1.15). The social influence from coach was more influential for
      athletes' effort and enjoyment in childhood, and competence in adolescence. We
      concluded that age appeared to moderate the impact of social influence from
      significant others on young athletes' sport experiences.

AB  - This study examine 53 European elite deaf athletes for their family's hearing
      status, use of hearing aids, communication preference, education in integrated or
      segregated settings, family members' encouragement for participation in sports,
      coach preference (hearing or deaf), and conditions for competitive events with
      deaf or hearing athletes. These data were gathered through semi-structured
      interviews administered in the athlete's native language. Deaf athletes reported 
      that when given the opportunity to compete with hearing athletes, it enhanced
      their opportunity for competition. Participating in sports with hearing athletes 
      played an important role in the integration of deaf athletes into mainstream
      society. If adaptations to communication can be made in these integrated
      settings, the ability of deaf athletes to participate in such settings will
      increase.

PG  - 463-72
LID - 10.1901/jaba.2010.43-463 [doi]
AB  - We evaluated several behavioral coaching procedures for improving offensive line 
      pass-blocking skills with 5 high school varsity football players. Pass blocking
      was measured during practice drills and games, and our intervention included
      descriptive feedback with and without video feedback and teaching with acoustical
      guidance (TAG). Intervention components and pass blocking were evaluated in a
      multiple baseline design, which showed that video feedback and TAG were the most 
      effective procedures. For all players, improved pass blocking matched a standard 
      derived by observing more experienced linemen and was evident in games.
      Additional intervention was required to maintain pass-blocking proficiency.
      Issues pertinent to behavioral coaching and sport psychology research are
      discussed.

      psychiatric disorders?
PG  - 461-5
LID - 10.1089/cyber.2010.0193 [doi]
AB  - The Internet plays a major role in adolescents' free time activities and
      communication nowadays. The aim here was to investigate the possibility of an
      association of computers and video games or sports (team, individual) with
      psychiatric disorders among underage psychiatric inpatients. The series of
      adolescents (n = 508) had been diagnosed using semistructured interviews
      (K-SADS-PL). The results showed that an interest in computers and video games did
      not increase the risk of any specific psychiatric disorder among these adolescent
      inpatients, but the likelihood of a substance-related disorder was statistically 
      significantly lower among the boys with computers as a hobby. Team sports were
      related to increased likelihood of conduct disorder among the boys, whereas the
      likelihood of an affective disorder was reduced. No such association was found in
      individual sports or among the girls. We conclude that social contacts and peers 
      play an important role in preventing adolescent depression.

PG  - 764-85
AB  - The aim of the present research was to investigate the relationship between
      coaching behavior and athletes' inherent self-talk (ST). Three studies were
      conducted. The first study tested the construct validity of the Coaching Behavior
      Questionnaire (CBQ) in the Greek language, and provided support for its original 
      factor structure. The second study examined the relationships between coaching
      behavior and athletes' ST in field, with two different samples. The results
      showed that supportive coaching behavior was positively related to positive ST
      (in one sample) and negatively related to negative ST (in both samples), whereas 
      negative coaching behavior was negatively related to positive ST (in one sample) 
      and positively related to negative ST (in both samples). Finally, the third study
      examined the relationships experimentally, to produce evidence regarding the
      direction of causality. The results showed that variations in coaching behavior
      affected participants' ST. Overall, the results of the present investigation
      provided considerable evidence regarding the links between coaching behavior and 
      athletes' ST and suggested that coaches may have an impact on athletes' thoughts.

TI  - Bearing the burden of doubt: female coaches' experiences of gender relations.
PG  - 506-17
AB  - Based on interview research, this study examined how master female coaches based 
      in the United Kingdom experienced relations with men within their profession.
      Using a feminist cultural studies approach to examine how sport promotes and
      maintains a gender order unfavorable to women, we found that female coaches felt 
      the need to continually prove themselves and often experienced coaching as a
      hostile and intimidating culture. Participants reported a gradual reduction in
      such unwelcoming behavior from men, seemingly because they had proved to be no
      threat to the existing patriarchal structure. A critical exploration of coaching 
      is needed to understand how masculine hegemony leads to women's relative
      powerlessness as coaches. Furthermore, the findings present a case for a greater 
      emphasis on sociocultural education within the UK coaching curricula.

PG  - 92-8
LID - 10.4085/1062-6050-46.1.92 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)-injury rate is greater among female
      athletes than among male athletes. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the rate and risk of
      ACL injury among Slovenian sportswomen playing professional basketball, team
      handball, or volleyball. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: The Slovenian
      National Organizations of basketball, team handball, and volleyball. PATIENTS OR 
      OTHER PARTICIPANTS: During the 2003-2004 season, we prospectively followed 585
      Slovenian sportswomen registered in the Slovenian National Organizations of
      basketball, team handball, and volleyball. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): We asked
      sportswomen and coaches to document the occurrence of every significant traumatic
      knee injury requiring medical attention. Injury rate and injury risk were
      calculated for sportswomen in each sport group. To calculate injury rate, we
      estimated the average exposure of each sportswoman during the research period.
      RESULTS: During the 2003-2004 season, 585 Slovenian sportswomen sustained 12 ACL 
      injuries. The ACL-injury risk was different in athletes participating in the
      various sports, with basketball players having the greatest ACL-injury risk and
      volleyball players having the lowest ACL-injury risk (P = .04). The risk of ACL
      injury among Slovenian sportswomen was 2.1 per 100 athletes (95% confidence
      interval = 0.9, 3.2), whereas the rate of ACL injury was 0.037 per 1000 exposure 
      hours (95% confidence interval = 0.016, 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Overall differences
      in injury risk were found among sports, but no differences were noted among
      divisions within sports. No differences for injury rate were observed between or 
      within sports. The rate and risk of ACL injury among Slovenian sportswomen are
      high, with basketball players having the greatest ACL-injury risk.

TI  - Sports concussion and the risk of chronic neurological impairment.
PG  - 6-12
LID - 10.1097/JSM.0b013e318204db50 [doi]
AB  - Intense recent media focus on long-term outcomes from sports concussion has
      highlighted concerns on both cognitive deterioration and mental health issues,
      such as depression and suicide. At this time, the scientific evidence to support 
      these views is limited, with only a handful of cases thus far reported. Based on 
      the literature on this topic that extends back over 50 years, it is clear that
      only a small percentage of athletes suffer such sequelae presumably due to
      recurrent concussive or subconcussive head impacts. At this stage, determining
      which athletes are at future risk is not possible; however, following existing
      concussion guidelines (eg, Zurich guidelines) is likely to be the safest option
      based on current evidence.

TI  - Exploring the organizational effect of prenatal testosterone upon the sporting
      brain.
PG  - 445-51
AB  - The 2D:4D ratio is a putative marker for prenatal testosterone and has the
      potential to explain variations in sport performance. To date there has been
      little research into the association between sporting performance, digit ratio
      and psychological variables. This study examined the relationship between 2D:4D
      and mental toughness, optimism, goal orientations, aggression, coping style and
      their association with sporting achievement. A post facto design was adopted.
      Participants consisted of an opportunity sample of 122 sports people: male (n
      =60) and female (n = 62) from a university in North East England. Following
      informed consent, a Vernier Caliper was used to measure digit ratio hand scans.
      Participants completed self-reports measures including, the Alternative
      Psychological Performance Inventory (Golby et al., 2008), Sport Mental Toughness 
      Questionnaire (Sheard et al., 2009), Life Orientation Test-Revised (Scheier et
      al., 1994), Buss-Perry aggression (Buss-Perry, 1992) and 30 item coping style
      questionnaire (Joseph et al., 1995). MANOVA revealed significant gender
      differences in 2D:4D with males demonstrating lower ratios (Manning, 2002). The
      2D:4D was found to differentiate eleven of the seventeen measured variables,
      including mental toughness scores (p < 0.001) and varying levels of sporting
      achievement i.e. international/national, regional and school levels (p< 0.001).
      Specifically, this difference was significant when comparing the highest
      (international/national) and lowest (leisure/school) groups. Perhaps there is a
      threshold for prenatal testosterone's influence upon sporting ability. Further
      research is necessary to examine the subtle differences between competitors
      involved in different achievement levels. It is proposed that high prenatal
      levels of testosterone may contribute to the development of increased mental
      toughness, optimism, ego/task goal orientations in individuals, and hence
      aptitude towards sport. Findings lend support for the tentative claim that mental
      toughness may be partially biologically predetermined. Theoretical and practical 
      implications are considered, along with limitations of the current study. Key
      pointsIncreased prenatal testosterone exposure was associated with successful
      sport performance. There is a need to further consider psychological aspects
      related to sport performance and their potential relationship with 2D:4D.Mental
      toughness variables, optimism, goal orientation, hostility and coping style are
      related to levels of 2:4D.Perhaps with further substantiation, 2D:4D could
      provide a supporting objective measure, to complement existing psychometric
      instruments.

TI  - Handball coaches' perceptions about the value of working competences according to
      their coaching background.
PG  - 193-202
AB  - The purpose of this study was to analyze the value attributed to given working
      competences, by Portuguese handball coaches according to their coaching
      background, certification level, coaching experience, and level of education. A
      sample of 207 handball coaches responded to a questionnaire which included
      demographic characteristics and a scale focused on perceptions of the level of
      importance attributed to working competences. Data analysis included an
      exploratory factorial analysis applying Maximum Likelihood Factoring (MLF) and
      Oblimin rotation. These factors were submitted to a One-way ANOVA and Tukey's
      post hoc multiple comparisons to analyse coaches' perceptions according to their 
      coaching background. A six factor solution was found where three major domains of
      competences were highlighted; the first one related to training and competition
      (e.g. planning and conducting the training, team administration in competition,
      annual and multi-annual planning, and coaching methodology); the second one
      related to social and cultural issues and management (e.g. implementation of
      youth sport development projects, team leadership and coach education) and the
      third one related to the cognitive background (meta-cognitive competences). The
      importance ascribed to some working competences was influenced by their coaching 
      experience and certification level. Highly experienced and qualified coaches
      perceived competences of everyday practice, social, cultural and management
      issues related to training and competition as more important than the other
      coaches. This study suggests the need to consider some working competences, until
      now not explicitly present in the Portuguese coaching education curriculum which 
      could enable coaches to choose the best way to practice/work in a manner that
      will foster and support their professional development. Key pointsThree major
      domains of competences were highlighted by Portuguese handball coaches. The first
      one related to training and competition, the second one related to social and
      cultural issues and management and the third one related to the cognitive
      background.The importance ascribed by Portuguese handball coaches to some working
      competences was influenced by their coaching experience and certification level, 
      as high experienced coaches and coaches with higher certification levels
      perceived competences related to training and competition of the everyday
      practice and social, cultural issues and management as more important.The value
      attributed by Portuguese handball coaches to working competences did not vary
      according to the coaches' academic education level.Portuguese handball coaches
      valued the meta-cognitive competences, the competences to implement sport
      development project and related to annual and multi-annual planning independently
      of their coaching background.

TI  - Review of rule modification in sport.
PG  - 1-8
AB  - The goal of this qualitative review was to analyze the state of the bibliography 
      about rule modification in sport. In the literature reviewed, there are few
      studies of rule modification and related aspects. Most studies omit mentioning
      the purpose of the modifications, but they do refer to the goals of their
      analysis (improving players' performance, attracting spectators and athletes,
      attending to commercial pressure, adapting the sport to children's needs and
      interests, preventing injuries). Eighty percent of the studies did not report the
      outcome of the previous modifications they analyzed. More than half of the
      studies (60%) achieved the proposed goals. Nearly two-thirds (63.83%) analyzed
      the effect of rule modification on game actions occurring during the game or
      through a test. Most of the studies (91.5%) did not consult the participants.
      Three-fourths of the studies (74.46%) examined the effect of rule modification
      without any knowledge of a previous analysis or without any previous analysis,
      and 74.47% studied rule modification related to internal logic. Modifications to 
      be introduced in a sport should be analyzed through a reflective process before
      their final introduction. The following points should be considered: establishing
      goals, respecting the basic rules without modifying them, becoming familiar with 
      players' and coaches' opinions, determining the effect of the modification on a
      wide spectrum of variables, elaborating useful proposals for the organizations
      that are responsible for competitions, using more than one type of data,
      modifying the internal logic and, preferably, the functional rules, and following
      some basic stages to consolidate rule modification. Key pointsRule modification
      involves processes that seek change in the game conditions with a certain goal in
      mind.The rules related to internal logic model the game actions that are
      characteristic of a sport.Functional rules facilitate achieving the goals.There
      are few valid research studies on which to base the modifications.Modifications
      in a sport should be validated after a reflective process before they are
      introduced.

TI  - Coaching competency and satisfaction with the coach: a multi-level structural
      equation model.
PG  - 411-22
LID - 10.1080/02640414.2010.538710 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this initial predictive validity study was to determine the
      ability of measures derived from the Athletes' Perceptions of Coaching Competency
      Scale II - High School Teams (APCCS II-HST) to predict satisfaction with the head
      coach. Specification of the statistical model was informed by the mediational
      model of coach-athlete interactions. The technical quality of the satisfaction
      measure was evaluated before testing the predictive validity of the coaching
      competency measures. Data were collected from athletes of seven sports. Athlete
      observations (N = 748) were clustered within teams (G = 74). Multi-group
      confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) provided evidence for factorial invariance of 
      a reduced version of the satisfaction measure by athlete gender. Multi-level CFA 
      provided evidence of model-data consistency for a reduced version of the
      satisfaction measure. Multi-level structural equation modelling provided evidence
      for the ability of latent coaching competency to positively predict latent
      satisfaction at both the athlete level (technique competency and motivation
      competency) and the team level (coaching competency) and for close model-data
      fit. Implications of this study include: that the APCCS II-HST should be viewed
      as a replacement for the Coaching Competency Scale when the intended population
      is appropriate; a preliminary multi-level measurement model for satisfaction with
      one's coach that should be considered as a potential starting point in subsequent
      studies; and empirical support for a key relationship proposed in the mediational
      model of coach-athlete interactions.

TI  - Efficacy of a 3 month training program on the jump-landing technique in
      jump-landing sports. Design of a cluster randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 281
LID - 10.1186/1471-2474-11-281 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: With the relatively high rate of injuries to the lower extremity due 
      to jump-landing movement patterns and the accompanied high costs, there is need
      for determining potential preventive programs. A program on the intervention of
      jump-landing technique is possibly an important preventative measure since it
      appeared to reduce the incidence of lower extremity injuries. In real life
      situations, amateur sports lack the infrastructure and funds to have a sports
      physician or therapist permanently supervising such a program. Therefore the
      current prevention program is designed so that it could be implemented by coaches
      alone. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this randomized controlled trial is to
      evaluate the effect of a coach supervised intervention program targeting
      jump-landing technique on the incidence of lower extremity injuries. METHODS: Of 
      the 110 Flemish teams of the elite division, 24 teams are included and equally
      randomized to two study groups. An equal selection of female and male teams with 
      allocation to intervention and control group is obtained. The program is a
      modification of other prevention programs previously proven to be effective. All 
      exercises in the current program are adjusted so that a more progressive
      development in the exercise is presented. Both the control and intervention group
      continue with their normal training routine, while the intervention group carries
      out the program on jump-landing technique. The full intervention program has a
      duration of three months and is performed 2 times a week during warm-up (5-10
      min). Injuries are registered during the entire season. DISCUSSION: The results
      of this study can give valuable information on the effect of a coach supervised
      intervention program on jump-landing technique and injury occurrence. Results
      will become available in 2011. TRIAL REGISTRATION: TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER:
      NTR2560.

      states in youth sport.
PG  - 171-80
LID - 10.1080/02640414.2010.530675 [doi]
AB  - We examined the three-way interactions among competence (actual and perceived),
      individuals' dispositional goal orientation (task/ego), and perceived sport
      motivational climate (mastery/performance) in the prediction of pleasant
      psychobiosocial states (i.e. emotion, cognition, motivation, bodily reaction,
      movement, performance, and communication) as conceptualized by the Individual
      Zones of Optimal Functioning model. The sample consisted of 320 Italian youths
      (160 girls and 160 boys) aged 13-14 years who were involved in individual or team
      sports. The assessment included a perceived competence scale, a goal orientation 
      questionnaire, a motivational climate inventory, and pleasant psychobiosocial
      descriptors. An actual competence scale was also administered to coaches asking
      them to assess their youngsters. Moderated hierarchical regression analysis
      showed that perceived competence, actual competence, and task orientation were
      the strongest predictors of pleasant psychobiosocial states. Moreover, actual
      competence and perceived competence interacted in different ways with
      dispositional goal orientations and motivational climate perceptions in the
      prediction of psychobiosocial states. It is therefore recommended that both
      constructs be included in motivational research.

TI  - Helmets and mouth guards: the role of personal equipment in preventing
      sport-related concussions.
PG  - 145-63, x
LID - 10.1016/j.csm.2010.09.006 [doi]
AB  - Millions of athletes in the United States experience concussions annually.
      Although helmets and mouth guards have decreased the risk of catastrophic head
      injuries, their protective effects on concussions are less clear. This article
      evaluates the current literature on the effect of equipment on concussions.
      Understanding the role that these equipment play in preventing concussions is
      complicated by many factors, such as selection bias in nonrandomized studies,
      variations in playing style, and risk compensation in sports with mandatory
      protective equipment. Improving coach and player education about proper
      concussion management, encouraging neck-strengthening exercises, and minimizing
      high-risk impacts may reduce concussions in sports.

TI  - iPods--a surrogate coach for junior and subelite athletes: new ideas based on a
      review of the literature.
PG  - 3507-19
LID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181e38055 [doi]
AB  - The global proliferation of MP3 players such as iPods means coaches have an
      opportunity to access a tool to enhance coaching that much of the population
      already use widely, without considerable increase in investment of time or money.
      Research evidence strongly indicates that music has the ability to influence
      psychological and physiological factors and can improve performance measures
      significantly. Additionally, the nature of athlete's self-talk could possibly be 
      influenced through the use of 'digiprompts,' resulting in more focused and
      productive training sessions. Research evidence also indicates a limited effect
      on athlete adaptation during unsupervised training sessions related to decreased 
      training frequency and intensity. Coaches should always look for ways to enhance 
      their coaching, but new technologies and methodologies will only be widely
      accepted if seen by the coaching community as readily accessible and able to
      facilitate efficient improvement in coaching methodologies and athlete
      development. With technological advances in music delivery systems and digital
      editing, digital media and delivery systems for distance coaching should be
      explored. This paper reviews several fields of research in an attempt to
      highlight how the use of what is now common digital technology can create a
      'surrogate coach.' Through the development of structured and specific digital
      training aids, the effects of music as an ergogenic aid means the use of MP3
      players seems a logical step forward for coaches, and unsupervised training could
      potentially be made more effective.

PG  - 347-51
LID - 10.1249/JSR.0b013e3181fc73d7 [doi]
AB  - Sickle cell trait (SCT) can pose a grave risk for some athletes. In the past
      decade in NCAA Division I football, no deaths have occurred from the play or
      practice of the game, but 16 deaths have occurred from conditioning for the game,
      and 10 (63%) of these deaths are tied to SCT, an excess of up to 21-fold.
      Research shows how and why, during intense exercise bouts, sickle cells can
      accumulate and "logjam" blood vessels, causing explosive rhabdomyolysis that can 
      kill. Sickling can begin in 2 to 5 min of all-out exertion and can reach grave
      levels soon thereafter if the athlete struggles on or is urged on by coaches
      despite warning signs. Sickling collapse is an intensity syndrome that differs
      from other common causes of collapse. Tailored precautions can prevent sickling
      collapse and enable athletes with SCT to thrive. Irrationally intense
      conditioning for a game puts the lives of healthy athletes with SCT at risk.

AB  - Dehydration, if sufficiently severe, impairs both physical and mental
      performance, and performance decrements are greater in hot environments and in
      long-lasting exercise. Athletes should begin exercise well hydrated and should
      drink during exercise to limit water and salt deficits. Many athletes are
      dehydrated to some degree when they begin exercise. During exercise, most drink
      less than their sweat losses, some drink too much and a few develop
      hyponatraemia. Athletes should learn to assess their hydration needs and develop 
      a personalized hydration strategy that takes account of exercise, environment and
      individual needs. Pre-exercise hydration status can be assessed from urine
      frequency and volume, with additional information from urine color, specific
      gravity or osmolality. Changes in hydration status during exercise can be
      estimated from the change in body mass: sweat rate can be estimated if fluid
      intake and urinary losses are also measured. Sweat salt losses can be determined 
      by collection and analysis of sweat samples. An appropriate, individualized
      drinking strategy will take account of pre-exercise hydration status and of
      fluid, electrolyte and substrate needs before, during and after a period of
      exercise.

TI  - Sporting events affect spectators' cardiovascular mortality: it is not just a
      game.
PG  - 972-7

AB  - Physiologic and clinical triggers, including mental stress, anxiety, and anger,
      often precipitate acute myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death. Sporting 
      events can acutely increase cardiovascular event and death rates. A greater
      impact is observed in patients with known coronary artery disease and when
      stressful features are present, including a passionate fan, a high-stakes game, a
      high-intensity game, a loss, and a loss played at home. Sporting events affect
      cardiovascular health through neuroendocrine responses and possibly an increase
      in high-risk behaviors. Acute mental stress increases the activity of the
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis and the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary 
      system while impairing vagal tone and endothelial function. Collectively, these
      mechanisms increase myocardial oxygen demand and decrease myocardial oxygen
      supply while also increasing the risk of arrhythmias and thrombosis. Measures can
      be taken to reduce cardiovascular risk, including the use of beta-blockers and
      aspirin, stress management, transcendental meditation, and avoidance of high-risk
      activities, such as smoking, eating fatty foods, overeating, and abusing alcohol 
      and illicit drugs. Sporting events have the potential to adversely affect
      spectators' cardiovascular health, and protective measures should be considered.

TI  - Leadership power perception of amateur and professional soccer coaches and
      players according to their belief in good luck or not.
PG  - 1001-8
AB  - The purpose of this study was to analyze the leadership power perception of
      amateur and professional soccer coaches and players according to their belief in 
      good luck or not. Data collected from 165 male soccer coaches and 870 male soccer
      players including professionals and amateurs. The coaches had a mean age of 40.24
      years (SD = 8.40) and had been coaching for an average of 8.56 years (SD = 6.75).
      The players had a mean age of 18.40 years (SD = 4.00) and had been playing soccer
      for an average of 6.00 years (SD = 4.15) with license. Adapted Turkish version of
      Power in Soccer Questionnaire-Other (PSQ-O for soccer players), Power in Soccer
      Questionnaire-Self (PSQ-S for coaches) and an information form were used for the 
      data collection. Cronbach Reliability Alphas of PSQ-O and PSQ-S range between
      0.60 and 0.84. Players' and coaches' data were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis and
      Mann Whitney Tests. Analysis of PSQ-O revealed significant differences related to
      Coersive Power-CP [chi2 (3) = 8.46, p < 0.037], Referent Power-RP [chi2 (3) =
      14.84, p < 0.002] and Expert Power-EP [chi2 (3) = 7.63, p < 0.054], and no
      significant differences related to Legitimate Power-LP (p > 0.05). Results of
      PSQ-O and PSQ-S indicated complex relationships related to belief in good luck or
      not. Overall, there are differences between coaches' and players'perception of
      CP, LP and EP related to belief in good luck or not. The only similarity appears 
      to be in perception of RP. However, there is lack of research to make more
      certain conclusions. Future researchers should also take into consideration
      gender, sport experience, age, taking responsibility, self-confidence,
      attributions, expectations, superstitions, emotions, perception of achievement
      etc.

TI  - Examining Sport Concussion Assessment Tool ratings for male and female youth
      hockey players with and without a history of concussion.
PG  - 1112-7
LID - 10.1136/bjsm.2009.071266 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Concussion is one of the most commonly occurring injuries in sport
      today. The Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT) is a commonly used paper
      neurocognitive tool. To date, little is known about SCAT baseline normative
      values in youth athletes. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine
      normative values on the SCAT for male and female youth hockey players. METHODS:
      This is a secondary data analysis of pooled data from three prospective cohort
      studies examining the risk of injury in paediatric ice hockey players aged 9-17
      years. A preseason baseline demographic and injury history questionnaire was
      completed by each player. RESULTS: A total of 4193 players completed SCATs at
      baseline and were included in the analysis. 781 players (18.6%) reported a
      previous history of concussion. Fatigue and low energy followed by headache were 
      the most commonly reported symptoms in all players. The majority of youth players
      could recite all five words immediately but only three words when delayed. A
      smaller proportion of the males were able to report the months of the year in
      reverse order compared with females of a similar age. The median number of digits
      recited in reverse order was 4. CONCLUSIONS: Youth ratings varied between age
      groups, gender and from previously reported ratings of varsity athletes, possibly
      reflecting developmental and gender differences. An understanding of these
      differences in youth athletes is important to ensure appropriate performance
      expectations on the SCAT and when making clinical decisions following a
      concussion.

TI  - Sport psychiatry: a systematic review of diagnosis and medical treatment of
      mental illness in athletes.
PG  - 961-80
LID - 10.2165/11536580-000000000-00000 [doi]
AB  - Sport psychiatry focuses on diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric illness in
      athletes in addition to utilization of psychological approaches to enhance
      performance. As this field and its research base are relatively new, clinicians
      often deliver psychiatric care to athletes without a full understanding of the
      diagnostic and therapeutic issues unique to this population. In this systematic
      review, we discuss published findings relating to psychiatric diagnosis and
      medical treatment of mental illness in athletes. There have been several studies 
      looking at the prevalence of some psychiatric disorders in various athlete
      populations. Eating disorders and substance abuse are the most studied of these
      disorders and appear to be common problems in athletes. However, to provide
      informed understanding and treatment, we especially need more research on
      overtraining syndrome, bipolar disorder, suicidality, anxiety disorders,
      attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and psychosis in athletes.
      Research is needed in the areas of prevalence, risk factors, prognosis and the
      unique experiences facing athletes with any of these disorders. Additionally,
      there have not been any large, systematic studies on the use of psychotropic
      medications in athletes. Small studies suggest that some medications may either
      be performance enhancing or detrimental to performance, but we need larger
      studies with rigorous methodology. Higher level athletes suffering from
      psychiatric symptoms often have reservations about taking medications with
      unknown performance and safety effects, and methodological issues with the
      current literature database preclude any definitive conclusions on performance
      effects of psychiatric medications. We need many more, higher quality studies on 
      the use by athletes of antidepressants, mood stabilizers, anxiolytics, stimulants
      and other ADHD medications, sedative-hypnotics and antipsychotics. Such studies
      should utilize sensitive performance measures and involve longer term use of
      psychotropic medications. Furthermore, study subjects should include athletes who
      actually have the psychiatric disorder for which the medication is proposed, and 
      should include more women.

TI  - Behaviour, the key factor for sports injury prevention.
PG  - 899-906
LID - 10.2165/11536890-000000000-00000 [doi]
AB  - Safety in sports and physical activity is an important prerequisite for
      continuing participation in sports, as well as for maintenance of a healthy
      physically active lifestyle. For this reason, prevention, reduction and control
      of sports injuries are important goals for society as a whole. Recent advances in
      sports medicine discuss the need for research on real-life injury prevention.
      Such views call for a more behavioural approach when it comes to actual sports
      injury prevention. Nevertheless, the role of behaviour in sports injury
      prevention remains under-researched. In order to push the field of sports injury 
      prevention forward, this article provides an overview of the relationship between
      behaviour and sports injury risk. Different types of behaviour relate to injury
      risk factors and injury mechanisms. Behaviour that influences risk factors and
      injury mechanisms is not confined only to the athlete. Various types of behaviour
      by, for example, the coach, referee, physical therapist or sports associations,
      also influence risk factors and injury mechanisms. In addition, multiple
      behaviours often act together. Some types of behaviour may directly affect injury
      risk and are by definition a risk factor. Other behaviours may only affect risk
      factors and injury mechanisms, and influence injury risk indirectly. Recent ideas
      on injury prevention that call for studies on real-life injury prevention still
      rely heavily on preventive measures that are established through efficacy
      research. A serious limitation in such an approach is that one expects that
      proven preventive measures will be adopted if the determinants and influences of 
      sports safety behaviours are understood. Therefore, if one truly wants to prevent
      sports injuries in a real-life situation, a broader research focus is needed. In 
      trying to do so, we need to look at lessons learned from other fields of injury
      prevention research.

TI  - How does sport psychology actually improve athletic performance? A framework to
      facilitate athletes' and coaches' understanding.
PG  - 386-402
LID - 10.1177/0145445510383525 [doi]
AB  - The popularity of sport psychology, both as an academic discipline and an applied
      practice, has grown substantially over the past two decades. Few within the realm
      of competitive athletics would argue with the importance of being mentally
      prepared prior to an athletic competition as well as the need to maintain that
      particular mindset during a competitive contest. Nevertheless, recent research
      has shown that many athletes, coaches, and sporting administrators are still
      quite reluctant to seek out the services of a qualified sport psychologist, even 
      if they believe it could help. One of the primary reasons for this hesitation
      appears to be a lack of understanding about the process and the mechanisms by
      which these mental skills affect performance. Unlike the "harder sciences" of
      sport physiology and biochemistry where athletes can see the tangible results in 
      themselves or other athletes (e.g., he or she lifted weights, developed larger
      muscles, and is now stronger/faster as a result), the unfamiliar and often
      esoteric nature of sport psychology appears to be impeding a large number of
      athletes from soliciting these important services. As such, the purpose of this
      article is to provide the reader with a simple framework depicting how mental
      skills training translates into improved within-competition performance. This
      framework is intended to help bridge the general "understanding gap" that is
      currently being reported by a large number of athletes and coaches, while also
      helping sport psychology practitioners sell their valuable services to individual
      athletes and teams.

TI  - Attitudes towards visual correction in sport: What coaches, physical education
      teachers and sports physicians think.
PG  - 71-6
LID - 10.1016/j.clae.2010.08.006 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate sport professionals' attitudes towards visual correction in 
      sport. METHOD: A questionnaire was handed out in schools, gyms, sports centres
      and universities, to coaches, physical education teachers and final year students
      of motor science. The questionnaire was given to one group of sport physicians
      prior to a 1-day scientific update course on the benefits of contact lenses (CLs)
      in sport. At the end of the course, certain questions from the questionnaire were
      given out again in order to evaluate the effect of the update on their opinions. 
      RESULTS: A total of 245 questionnaires were collected. The interviewees stated
      that correcting a vision defect during sports practice was important, but their
      propensity to suggest CLs for sport, though still rather high in value, showed a 
      statistically significant drop. This drop did not occur if the CLs were
      recommended for competitive sports. This trend remained unchanged if a specific
      judgement was requested for the adolescent category. The tendency to suggest CLs 
      was higher in CL wearers as compared to non-wearers. The sport with the lowest
      recommendation of CLs was swimming. In the sample of sports physicians, a
      specific education on the subject of CLs increased the propensity to adopt CLs in
      sports. CONCLUSIONS: The main "actors" in the sports sector regard correcting a
      vision defect during sport to be important. Nevertheless, their tendency to
      suggest CLs is significantly lower. Works that make these categories aware of the
      benefits of CLs in sport can certainly help to fill this gap.

TI  - Aspects of disordered eating continuum in elite high-intensity sports.
PG  - 112-21
LID - 10.1111/j.1600-0838.2010.01190.x [doi]
AB  - Dieting is an important risk factor for disordered eating and eating disorders.
      Disordered eating occurs on a continuum from dieting and restrictive eating,
      abnormal eating behavior, and finally clinical eating disorders. The prevalence
      of eating disorders is increased in elite athletes and for this group the cause
      of starting to diet is related to (a) perception of the paradigm of appearance in
      the specific sport, (b) perceived performance improvements, and (c) sociocultural
      pressures for thinness or an "ideal" body. Athletes most at risk for disordered
      eating are those involved in sports emphasizing a thin body size/shape, a high
      power-to-weight ratio, and/or sports utilizing weight categories, such as in some
      high-intensity sports. In addition to dieting, personality factors, pressure to
      lose weight, frequent weight cycling, early start of sport-specific training,
      overtraining, injuries, and unfortunate coaching behavior, are important risk
      factors. To prevent disordered eating and eating disorders, the athletes have to 
      practice healthy eating, and the medical staff of teams and parents must be able 
      to recognize symptoms indicating risk for eating disorders. Coaches and leaders

      that openness regarding this challenge is important.

AB  - In sports, the importance of optimizing the recovery-stress state is critical.
      Effective recovery from intense training loads often faced by elite athletes can 
      often determine sporting success or failure. In recent decades, athletes,
      coaches, and sport scientists have been keen to find creative, new methods for
      improving the quality and quantity of training for athletes. These efforts have
      consistently faced barriers, including overtraining, fatigue, injury, illness,
      and burnout. Physiological and psychological limits dictate a need for research
      that addresses the avoidance of overtraining, maximizes recovery, and
      successfully negotiates the fine line between high and excessive training loads. 
      Monitoring instruments like the Recovery-Stress Questionnaire for Athletes can
      assist with this research by providing a tool to assess their perceived state of 
      recovery. This article will highlight the importance of recovery for elite
      athletes and provide an overview of monitoring instruments.

AB  - The importance of psychological skills training (PST) in the development of
      athletic performance is widely recognized. This paper is a comprehensive review
      of PST in elite sports, with a special focus on high-intensity sports (HIS). The 
      reviewed literature showed a lack of convincing evidence and theoretical
      underpinning concerning traditional psychological skills to enhance performance
      in HIS. Therefore, a model with three conceptual levels (psychological demands,
      skills and techniques) is presented. The model facilitates the identification of 
      the psychological demands of a specific sport, which in turn enables
      distinguishing which psychological skills are required. This allows an expert to 
      choose psychological techniques to improve the athlete's psychological skill.
      Considerations based on our model and the limited HIS-related literature
      available revealed self-skills, personal development and life skills,
      arousal-regulation skills, volitional skills, motivational skills and recovery
      skills as the most important skills to address in order to enhance performance.
      Development of harmonious passion, in-practice integration of volitional
      strategies, use of associative attentional techniques, pain management
      techniques, use of the mindfulness-acceptance approach and the facilitative
      interpretation of cognitive and somatic sensations are regarded as suitable to
      meet the psychological demands of HIS. They are recommended for systematic
      application by athletes and coaches.

AB  - Training toward improving performance in sports involving high intense exercise
      can and is done in many different ways based on a mixture of tradition in the
      specific sport, coaches' experience and scientific recommendations. Strength
      training is a form of training that now-a-days have found its way into almost all
      sports in which high intense work is conducted. In this review we will focus on a
      few selected aspects and consequences of strength training; namely what effects
      do strength training have of muscle fiber type composition, and how may these
      effects change the contractile properties of the muscle and finally how will this
      affect the performance of the athlete. In addition, the review will deal with
      muscle hypertrophy and how it develops with strength training. Overall, it is not
      the purpose of this review to give a comprehensive up-date of the area, but to
      pin-point a few issues from which functional training advises can be made. Thus, 
      more than a review in the traditional context this review should be viewed upon
      as an attempt to bring sports-physiologists and coaches or others working
      directly with the athletes together for a mutual discussion on how recently
      acquired physiological knowledge are put into practise.

      swimming: results of a longitudinal study.
PG  - 75-81
AB  - There have been few studies comparing substance use and misuse (SU&M) in
      different performing arts forms. Herein, we identified and compared SU&M in women
      studying an art (ballet, n = 21), a non-Olympic sport (dance sport, n = 25), and 
      an Olympic sport (synchronized swimming, n = 23). The sample of variables
      comprised general, educational, and sport factors, as well as SU&M data,
      including consumption of opiates, cigarettes, alcohol, nutritional supplements,
      doping behaviors, and beliefs. Using the Kruskal-Wallis test, we found no
      significant differences between study groups in potential doping behaviors. Most 
      of the examinees reported that they did not rely on physicians' and/or coaches'
      opinions regarding doping. Only sport dancers recognized their consumption of
      cannabis as a violation of anti-doping rules. Those more convinced that doping
      habits are present in their sport (or art) have a certain tendency toward doping 
      usage. In conclusion, a strong anti-doping campaign within the studied arts is
      suggested, focusing on the health-related problems of SU&M.

AB  - Autonomic dysreflexia (AD) is unique to individuals with spinal injuries (SCI) at
      T6 or above and can be voluntarily induced. Although AD improves wheelchair
      racing performance in some athletes, it also elicits exaggerated blood pressure, 
      which could be dangerous. The International Paralympic Committee considers AD
      doping and banned its use. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate AD
      knowledge, incidence and attitudes (KIA) of Paralympians with SCI. METHODS: An
      existing questionnaire was modified to include questions of AD KIA, validated by 
      three experts and piloted with a small sample. It was administered on-line,
      mailed to members of a scientific network and distributed during the Beijing
      Paralympic Games. Fisher Exact test was used to evaluate differences across
      gender, injury and education. RESULTS: Of 99 participants, 54.5% had previously
      heard of AD while 39.4% were unaware; 16.7%, all males, had used AD to enhance
      performance. Participants reported that AD was (1) useful for middle (78.6%) and 
      long distance (71.4%), marathon (64.3%) and wheelchair rugby (64.3%); (2)
      somewhat dangerous (48.9%), dangerous (21.3%) or very dangerous (25.5%) to
      health. Results were not influenced by age, injury level or injury duration.
      CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate the need for educational programmes directed
      towards enhancing the AD knowledge of rehabilitation professionals, coaches and
      trainers working with SCI individuals.

PG  - 1197-208
LID - 10.1080/02640414.2010.487873 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine coach strategies for addressing
      athletes' psychosocial challenges in returning to sport following injury
      rehabilitation. Qualitative interviews with eight elite coaches from the Western 
      Australian Institute of Sport (WAIS) in Perth, Australia revealed that coaches
      facilitated athletes' return to sport from injury through a variety of means, but
      did not typically provide systematic forms of assistance. Coaches commented that 
      the idiosyncratic nature of the injury experience meant that they needed to apply
      strategies consistent with athletes' particular psychosocial needs. Such
      strategies included: (a) coordination of a "team approach" to rehabilitation; (b)
      fostering open communication with athletes and treatment team members; (c) social
      support; (d) positive thinking and goal setting; and (e) role models. Analysis of
      these strategies revealed that coaches attempted to address competence, autonomy,
      and relatedness needs in facilitating athletes' return from injury. These
      findings suggest that self-determination theory may be a valuable approach for
      examining coach forms of assistance regarding athletes' return to competition
      following injury. Findings are discussed in relation to injury literature and
      self-determination theory. Suggestions for future research are also presented.

TI  - Burnout and perceived stress among university coaches in Lithuania.
PG  - 302-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the associations between burnout, gender, working
      experience and perceived stress among university coaches in Lithuania. METHODS: A
      random sample of university coaches (N=203) was investigated (136 male and 67
      female coaches; 131 coaches, with 10 yr or more work experience, and 72 coaches
      with less than 10 yr job experience). Two questionnaires-the Coach Burnout
      Questionnaire (CBQ) and Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10)-were used. The
      statistical hypotheses were tested by the independent samples t-test and binary
      logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences at
      the 0.01 level for burnout among coaches with 10 yr or more (burnout average
      score and standard deviation 2.28 +/- 0.42), and coaches, who less than 10 yr job
      experience (1.97 +/- 0.35) were found. No differences were observed between males
      and females with regard to burnout. The odds ratio (OR) of perceived stress for
      burnout was 1.92; 95% CI 1.01-3.64. CONCLUSIONS: Significant association between 
      burnout and job experience of 10 yr or more as compared to less than 10 yr among 
      the university coaches was observed. High levels of perceived stress among
      university coaches are significantly related to burnout.

TI  - Assessing the need for knowledge on injury management among high school athletic 
      coaches in South Dakota.
PG  - 241-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: A lack of health coverage at athletic competitions and practices
      poses concern over the knowledge coaches have in providing adequate health care
      to high school (HS) athletes. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to
      determine the need for education of coaches in the prevention, assessment and
      management of sports-related injuries in South Dakota (SD). METHODS: Survey link 
      e-mailed to 1,050 HS athletic head coaches in SD; 247 (23.5 percent) completed
      the prospective, web-based survey. RESULTS: Of the respondents, 74.91 percent
      reported HS enrollments less than 300, with 79.36 percent in rural/frontier
      counties and 28.74 percent in medically underserved areas. Coaches from 14 sports
      responded. The majority indicated they were responsible for the immediate medical
      care of athletes at practices (89.07 percent) and competitions (74.90 percent);
      and 79.76 percent of coaches agreed or strongly agreed they needed more injury
      management education. Results also indicated less than 50.00 percent had current 
      certifications in CPR/BLS (46.65 percent) and first aid (47.4 percent).
      CONCLUSIONS: Due to the demand placed on head coaches to be the initial
      caregivers for injured athletes, there is a need for increased education of SD
      coaches related to the management of acute sports injuries. Additionally, policy 
      changes may be indicated to address the lack of medical personnel available
      during HS athletic competitions and practices.

TI  - Mental Well-Being and Sport-Related Identities in College Students.
PG  - 335-356
AB  - Past research has linked physical activity and sports participation with improved
      mental and social well-being, including reduced risk of depression and
      suicidality. In this study we examined relationships among several dimensions of 
      athletic involvement (team sport participation, individual sport participation,
      athlete identity, and jock identity), gender, and depression and suicidal
      behavior in a sample of 791 undergraduate students. Both participation in a team 
      sport and athlete identity were associated with lower depression scores. Athlete 
      identity was also associated with lower odds of a past-year suicide attempt,
      whereas jock identity was associated with elevated odds of a suicide attempt. The
      findings are discussed in light of the relationship between mental well-being and
      a larger constellation of health-risk behaviors linked to a "toxic jock"
      identity.

TI  - Online training in sports concussion for youth sports coaches.
PG  - 1-12
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate ACTive: Athletic Concussion Training
      using Interactive Video Education, an interactive e-learning program designed to 
      train community coaches of youth ages 10-18 in effective sports concussion
      prevention and management practices. Seventy-five youth sports coaches from
      across the country completed the study over the Internet. Results of a randomized
      control trial demonstrated significant differences between treatment and control 
      participants on measures of (a) knowledge about sports concussion, management,
      and prevention; (b) attitudes about the importance of preventing sports
      concussion; and (c) intention and self-efficacy in sports concussion management
      and prevention. The results suggest that ACTive is an effective method of
      training youth sports coaches who are in an important position to reduce risks
      associated with sports concussion.

TI  - Sports-related dental injuries: knowledge of first aid and mouthguard use in a
      sample of Italian children and youngsters.
PG  - 66-70
AB  - AIM: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the awareness of sports as risk
      factor of dental injuries, the emergency management when a tooth avulsion occurs 
      and the compliance about mouthguards. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred children
      and youngsters 8- to 15-year-old (147 boys and 53 girls) attending Sports
      Societies in Isernia, a town in Southern Italy, participated to the
      investigation. The sports involved were soccer, martial arts, tennis, swimming,
      volleyball, basketball and cycling. The questionnaire was structured into three
      parts: 1) questions about age, sex, type and time of sports practice; 2)
      questions about dental injuries, particularly personal experience, awareness of
      first aid and procedure about tooth avulsion; 3) questions about knowledge and
      use of mouthguards. RESULTS: Sixty-five per cent of the athletes were aware of
      the possibility of oral injuries during sports practice and 8.5% referred an
      experience of dental trauma; 71.5% of the participants think that the immediate
      management of dental injuries by a dentist is very important to increase the rate
      of success; 31% know that the avulsed tooth may be reimplanted: 33.9% would
      reimplant the tooth within an hour and 62.9% would keep it in a wet storage
      medium. Finally, 80.5% of the athletes knew about mouthguards as protective
      devices, but only 5% actually used them; eight out of ten were provided by the
      dentist. CONCLUSION: Educational programs organized by the sports dentistry
      community are needed to inform coaches, teachers, athletes and parents about
      dental injuries and to promote the mouthguards use, especially in contact sports 
      practice.

TI  - Sports injuries in young athletes: long-term outcome and prevention strategies.
PG  - 29-34
LID - 10.3810/psm.2010.06.1780 [doi]
AB  - Physical activity plays a significant role in the physical and emotional
      well-being of a child. In the past 15 to 20 years, there has been a dramatic
      increase in sports participation at a young age, which has offered numerous
      health benefits, including self-esteem, confidence, team play, fitness, agility, 
      and strength. Children are playing sports at younger ages. This article assesses 
      the long-term outcome of sports injuries in young athletes, with suggestions on
      how to prevent such injuries. There are no definitive epidemiological data on
      withdraw from sports activities due to injury in young athletes. Disturbed
      physeal growth as a result of injury can result in length discrepancy, angular
      deformity, or altered joint mechanics, and may cause significant long-term
      disability. Sequelae of Osgood-Schlatter lesion include painful ossicle in the
      distal patellar tendon. Fragmentation or separation of the apophysis appears to
      be the result of adaptive changes to the increased stress that occurs in overuse 
      activities. The presence of these changes undeniably demonstrates an osseous
      reaction, although they are not disabling. Promotion of a physically active
      lifestyle is encouraged worldwide, particularly with regard to the many health
      benefits. Reduction of only a moderate proportion of all sports injuries is of
      significance for the young athletes' health and could have a long-term economic
      impact on health care costs. It is therefore important to convince medical
      doctors, physical therapists, athletic trainers and coaches, as well as athletes 
      of the necessity to implement active prevention measures in their therapy and
      training programs, thus decreasing the injury and re-injury rate and enhancing
      athletic performance.

TI  - Evaluation of Iranian college athletes' sport nutrition knowledge.
PG  - 257-63
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the nutrition knowledge and the factors
      determining this knowledge in Iranian college basketball and football athletes.
      By highlighting gaps in nutrition knowledge of these athletes, sport nutrition
      professionals may begin to address these gaps by educating athletes with a view
      toward minimizing injury and enhancing sport performance. Sixty-six basketball
      and 141 football players (response rate 78.4%) from 4 medical and 8 nonmedical
      universities in Tehran agreed to participate in this cross-sectional study. A
      2-part questionnaire was used; the first part comprised questions identifying
      demographic information, and the second part comprised a previously
      well-validated questionnaire on sport nutrition knowledge. The overall knowledge 
      score was 33.2% (+/- 12.3%). Men scored 28.2% (+/- 12.7%), and women, 38.7% (+/- 
      14.2%). In both genders, the highest score was obtained for the nutrients
      subcategory, and the supplements subcategory was the most poorly answered. When
      compared with their peers, a significantly higher score was obtained by women (p 
      < .001), athletes at medical universities (p < .001), and those obtaining
      nutrition information from reputable sources (p = .03). The coach was cited by
      89.4% of athletes as their main source of nutrition information. This study
      showed that the sport nutrition knowledge of these athletes is inadequate.
      Considering that this substandard level of knowledge may contribute to poor
      dietary behaviors, these athletes would benefit from nutrition-related training
      and education.

TI  - Low back pain in childhood and adolescence: assessment of sports activities.
PG  - 94-9
LID - 10.1007/s00586-010-1485-8 [doi]
AB  - A cross-sectional study that targeted a total of 43,630 pupils in Niigata City,
      Japan was performed. The objective of the study was to evaluate the association
      between sports activities and low back pain (LBP) in childhood and adolescence in
      Japan. Regarding risk factors of LBP, a large number of studies have been
      conducted that have examined gender differences, height and weight, body mass
      index, sports time, differences in lifestyle, family history, and mental factors;
      however, no definitive conclusion has yet been made. A questionnaire survey was
      conducted using 43,630 pupils, including all elementary school pupils from the
      fourth to sixth grade (21,893 pupils) and all junior high pupils from the first
      to third year (21,737 pupils) in Niigata City (population of 785,067). 26,766
      pupils who were determined to have valid responses (valid response rate 61.3%)
      were analyzed. Among the 26,766 pupils with valid responses, 2,591 (9.7%) had LBP
      at the time of the survey, and 8,588 (32.1%) had a history of LBP. The pupils
      were divided between those who did not participate in sports activities except
      the physical education in school (No sports group: 5,486, 20.5%) and those who
      participated in sports activities (Sports group: 21,280, 79.5%), and the
      difference in lifetime prevalence between No sports group and Sports group was
      examined. The odds ratio for LBP according to sports activity was calculated by
      multiple logistic regression analysis adjusted for gender, age, and body mass
      index. In addition, the severity of LBP was divided into three levels (Level 1:
      no limitation in any activity, Level 2: necessary to refrain from participating
      in sports and physical activities, and Level 3: necessary to be absent from
      school), and Levels 2 and 3 were defined as severe LBP; the severity was compared
      between No sports group and Sports group and in each sport's items. Moreover, in 
      Sports group, the amount of time spent participating in sports activities were
      divided into three groups (Group 1: less than 6 h per week, Group 2: 6-12 h per
      week, and Group 3: 12.1 h per week or more), and the dose-response between the
      amount of time spent participating in sports activities and the occurrence of LBP
      were compared. In No sports group, 21.3% experienced a history of LBP; in Sports 
      group, 34.9% experienced LBP (P < 0.001). In comparison to No sports group, the
      odds ratio was significantly higher for Sports group (1.57), and also
      significantly higher for most of the sports items. The severity of LBP was
      significantly higher in Sports group (20.1 vs. 3.2%, P < 0.001). The amount of
      time spent participating in sports activities averaged 9.8 h per week, and a
      history of LBP significantly increased in the group which spent a longer time
      participating in sports activities (odds ratio 1.43 in Group 3). These findings
      suggest that sports activity is possible risk factors for the occurrence of LBP, 
      and it might increase the risk for LBP in childhood and adolescence.

      with the GB squad for athletes with learning difficulties. METHODS: A review of
      key and relevant literature is presented, followed by a discussion of the sport
      science support provision and the issues that emerged in working with athletes
      with learning difficulties. Pre- and post- physiological tests along with
      evaluations of athletes' potential to benefit from sport psychology support were 
      conducted. The aim of these tests was to provide information for the athletes and
      the coaches on fitness levels, to use this information to plan future training,
      and to identify how well the performance could be enhanced. RESULTS: A case study
      is presented for one athlete, who had competed in distance events. The focus is
      the psychological support that was provided. CONCLUSIONS: It is clear that
      athletes with learning difficulties require the same type of sports science
      support as their mainstream peers. However, sport scientists will need to
      consider ways to extend their practice in order to provide the appropriate level 
      of support.

TI  - Differences in self-regulatory skills among talented athletes: the significance
      of competitive level and type of sport.
PG  - 901-8
LID - 10.1080/02640411003797157 [doi]
AB  - Research has shown that talented athletes outscore their mainstream peers on the 
      basis of self-regulation. Although valuable, this does not tell us more about the
      distinction between good athletes and the best, which is a prerequisite in talent
      development. Therefore, we examined the self-regulatory skills of 222 male and
      female talented athletes aged 12-16 years as a function of competitive sport
      level (junior international or junior national athletes) and type of sport
      (individual or team sports). Multivariate analyses of covariance in combination
      with a discriminant function analysis revealed that "reflection" distinguishes
      between athletes at the highest levels of excellence. Furthermore, athletes
      playing individual sports had higher scores on "planning" and "effort" than team 
      sport athletes, highlighting the importance of differences between types of
      sport. In conclusion, we emphasize the importance of reflection as a
      self-regulatory skill. Reflection facilitates the development of sport-specific
      characteristics, which may vary by type of sport. This means that an advanced
      sense of reflection may help talented athletes to acquire desirable
      characteristics during their "talent" years to ultimately reach adult elite
      levels of competition.

TI  - Coaches' perspectives on implementing an evidence-informed injury prevention
      programme in junior community netball.
PG  - 1128-32
LID - 10.1136/bjsm.2009.069039 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: For effective sports injury prevention, information is needed about
      the implementation context for interventions. This study describes coaches'
      feedback on the implementation of an evidence-informed injury prevention
      programme in community junior netball using coaches' perceptions and the RE-AIM
      framework. METHODS: A lower-limb injury prevention programme (Down to Earth;
      D2E), for teaching safe-landing techniques, was delivered to 31 coaches from 31
      junior community netball teams in a 1-h workshop. Coaches then delivered a 6-week
      programme at team training sessions starting in the week before the competition
      season commenced. 65% of coaches completed a feedback survey 17 weeks after they 
      had delivered the programme. RESULTS: Most (88%) coaches believed that D2E
      improved their players' ability to perform correct landing techniques in games
      and that players had retained these improvements over the season. The majority
      (83%) indicated that an improvement in player athletic attributes was the
      greatest advantage of D2E, followed by a reduction in injury risk. Identified
      barriers to implementing D2E were running out of time and very young players
      finding the drills too difficult. Coaches reported that they needed more ideas
      for training drills that could be incorporated into their programmes and believed
      that their own coaching training did not adequately prepare them to implement an 
      injury prevention programme. CONCLUSIONS: Although coaches believed that D2E was 
      effective in developing correct landing techniques, some modifications are needed
      to make it more suitable for younger players and coach education by accreditation
      courses could be improved to support the implementation of injury prevention
      programmes.

AB  - Many physically and cognitively challenged athletes participate in organized and 
      recreational sports. Health benefits of sport participation by athletes with
      disabilities have been well recognized. A careful preparticipation evaluation and
      proper classification of athletes ensures safe sports participation by athletes
      with disabilities. Some conditions in these athletes, such as problems with
      thermoregulation, autonomic control, neurogenic bladder and bowel, latex allergy,
      and many associated and secondary complications deserve special consideration.
      This article reviews common medical issues that relate to sport participation by 
      athletes with physical and cognitive disabilities.

AB  - The complexity of wheelchair sports provides the scientist with a unique
      challenge. There are two major components that contribute towards 'wheeled
      sports' performance: the athlete and the chair. It is the interaction of these
      two components that enable wheelchair propulsion and the sporting movements
      required within a given sport. This article will describe three discrete case
      studies on how sport scientists have worked with Great Britain coaches and
      practitioners to help optimise training leading to a major competition through
      evidence base practise. A fourth area will describe on-going work designed to
      address the optimisation of wheelchair configurations for wheelchair court
      sports. It will focus on four sports: wheelchair racing, wheelchair tennis,
      wheelchair basketball and wheelchair rugby. The first topic will discuss the
      concept of pushing economy and mechanical efficiency of wheelchair propulsion.
      The second topic will show how technology assists the coaching process. The third
      topic will illustrate the concept of sports classification, and show how training
      volume 'in terms of basketball shooting' may need to be individually assigned and
      finally future research within wheelchair team sports and chair configurations
      will be examined.

PG  - 199-211
AB  - This study examined (a) variations in the perceptions of peer- and
      coach-generated motivational climate within and between teams and (b) individual-
      and group-level factors that can account for these variations. Participants were 
      483 athletes between 12 and 16 years old. The results showed that perceptions of 
      both peer- and coach-generated climate varied as a function of group-level
      variables, namely team success, coach's gender (except for peer ego-involving
      climate), and team type (only for coach ego-involving climate). Perceptions of
      peer- and coach-generated climate also varied as a function of individual-level
      variables, namely athletes' task and ego orientations, gender, and age (only for 
      coach task-involving and peer ego-involving climate). Moreover, within-team
      variations in perceptions of peer- and coach-generated climate as a function of
      task and ego orientation levels were identified. Identifying and controlling the 
      factors that influence perceptions of peer- and coach-generated climate may be
      important in strengthening task-involving motivational cues.

AB  - The aim of this study was to characterize the learning styles of different groups
      of athletes grouped according to level of performance and sport. Seventy-one male
      athletes completed a questionnaire on learning styles at the beginning of the
      2008-2009 training season. Learning styles were assessed using the Honey-Alonso
      Learning Styles Questionnaire, and were also converted into learning styles
      described by Kolb. The Honey-Alonso learning styles were compared among the
      various groups using one-way analysis of variance, and the Kolb learning styles
      that were most favoured using a chi-square test. Pearson's correlation
      coefficient was used to verify the relationships between variables. No
      significant differences were observed in learning styles between different sports
      and physical activities. Years of experience did not correlate strongly with
      learning styles. With respect to level of performance, the pragmatic component
      was significantly lower in professional athletes than amateur and recreational
      athletes. These characteristics of learning styles preferred by the athletes
      should help coaches and physical trainers to reflect on their role as educators
      in the context of planning sports training.

TI  - The controlling interpersonal style in a coaching context: development and
      initial validation of a psychometric scale.
PG  - 193-216
AB  - This article outlines the development and initial validation of the Controlling
      Coach Behaviors Scale (CCBS), a multidimensional self-report measure designed to 
      assess sports coaches' controlling interpersonal style from the perspective of
      self-determination theory (Ryan & Deci, 2002). Study 1 generated a pool of items,
      based on past literature and feedback from coaches, athletes, and academic
      experts. The factorial structure of the questionnaire was tested using
      exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses across Studies 2 and 3. The final
      CCBS model in Study 3 comprised 4 factors (controlling use of rewards,
      conditional regard, intimidation, and excessive personal control) and was
      cross-validated using a third independent sample in Study 4. The scale
      demonstrated good content and factorial validity, as well as internal consistency
      and invariance across gender and sport type. Suggestions for its use in research 
      pertaining to the darker side of coaching and sport participation are discussed.

LID - 10.1249/JSR.0b013e3181df1179 [doi]
AB  - The use of artificial turf on playing fields has increased in popularity.
      Advances in technology have allowed for the development of turf that closely
      mimics the properties of natural grass. Overall injury incidence does not differ 
      between the two surfaces, but unique injury patterns are apparent between the two
      surfaces. Differences in shoe-surface interface, in-shoe foot loading patterns,
      and impact attenuation may provide insight into the different injury patterns.
      Player perceptions of artificial turf vary and may be related to different
      physiological demands between the two surfaces. Artificial turf has been
      implicated in skin infections, but concerns about other health consequences
      related to the synthetic materials have not been proven yet. Understanding the
      differences between artificial turf and natural grass will help physicians,
      athletic trainers, and coaches better care for and train their athletes.

AB  - The primary aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between
      confidence and subjective performance in addition to exploring whether coping
      mediated this relationship. A sample of 414 athletes completed a measure of
      confidence before performance. Athletes also completed a measure of coping and
      subjective performance after competing. Correlational findings revealed that
      confidence was positively and significantly associated with subjective
      performance. Furthermore, mediational analysis found that coping partly mediated 
      this relationship. In particular, task-oriented coping (i.e., mental imagery) and
      disengagement-oriented coping (i.e., resignation) had positive and negative
      mediational effects, respectively. Additionally, athletes who employed mental
      imagery generally coped more effectively than those using resignation. These
      findings imply mental imagery has the potential not only to improve confidence,
      but also subsequent performance, while resignation coping may have the opposite
      effect. Overall, these results lend some credence to Vealey's integrated sports
      confidence model.

TI  - Differences in strength and conditioning coach self-perception of leadership
      style behaviors at the National Basketball Association, Division I-A, and
      Division II levels.
PG  - 1440-50
LID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181d321ec [doi]
AB  - Leader behaviors have been found to vary by competitive level (6,9,11,26).
      Similar differences based on the competitive environment have been reported with 
      strength coaches and their training emphases (15,28) but not their leadership
      style behaviors. This latter area is important to explore because strength coach 
      leader behaviors may result in enhanced cooperation, improved communication, and 
      improved athlete psychological and emotional well-being (14,23,25,27).
      Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to examine the differences in
      self-perceived leadership styles of National Basketball Association, Division I-A
      (DI-A) men's basketball, and Division II (DII) men's basketball strength and
      conditioning coaches. The self-perceived leadership styles of 145 men's
      basketball strength coaches (National Basketball Association [NBA]=22, DI-A=92,
      and DII=31) were obtained using the Revised Leadership Scale for Sport (26,41).
      Frequency data about demographics and training methods were also collected. No
      significant differences were reported for positive feedback. Otherwise, NBA
      strength coaches reported more democratic leadership style behaviors than DI-A
      strength coaches. Division I-A strength coaches were found to be more autocratic 
      than NBA or DII strength coaches. Both NBA and DI-A strength coaches indicated a 
      higher level of training and instruction than did DII strength coaches. National 
      Basketball Association strength coaches also reported engaging in more
      situational and socially supportive leader behaviors than DI-A and DII strength
      coaches. Leader behaviors can positively and negatively impact an athlete (23);
      thus, strength coaches need to evaluate their competitive environment and reflect
      on the impact of their behaviors and how their approach to leading athletes may
      need to vary based on the situation.

PG  - 1070-5

AB  - Although several studies showed the positive effects of exercise and physical
      activity on health and well-being for individuals with ID, there is a lack of
      information about the influence of sport specialization on fitness and health
      components. Therefore, the aims of this study were to assess: (a) physical
      fitness of athletes with intellectual disability (ID) compared with individuals
      included in recreational and leisure activity programs (non-athletic people); (b)
      contribution of sport specialization on athletes' fitness; and c) correlation of 
      each fitness variable with subjects' ID levels. Twenty-two track and field, 19
      basketball, and 23 non-athletic adults were recruited. Before and after a 9-month
      period, all participants performed fitness tests assessing body composition,
      flexibility (SR), arm muscular strength (HG), lower and upper-body muscular
      strength and endurance (SUP and PUP), explosive leg power (SLJ), cardiovascular
      endurance (ST), balance ability (FT), motor coordination (TUGT). The results
      showed that participants' weight, BMI and FT were significantly affected by time;
      SLJ by activity; ST, HG, PUP, SUP, and TUGT by both time and activity. Only track
      and field athletes increased significantly ST. All athletes improved
      significantly HG, PUP and SUP, instead non-athletic people decreased
      significantly SUP (p<0.01). TUGT improved significantly in track and field
      athletes (p<0.05), and decreased significantly in non-athletic people. ID level
      was positively correlated to TUGT. Findings of this study showed that physical
      activity improved fitness in adult athletes with ID, decreasing health risks.
      Athletes with lower ID obtained higher performance scores in motor coordination
      test.

TI  - The rodeo athlete: sport science: part I.
PG  - 417-31
LID - 10.2165/11531390-000000000-00000 [doi]
AB  - Based on the tradition, history and lore of the American West, as well as the
      individualistic nature and lifestyle of the sport of rodeo, the rodeo athlete has
      achieved iconic status in sport, literature, art and entertainment. For over half
      a century, rodeo has become a staple of organized sport programmes in high
      schools, universities and international competitions. The origins of rodeo grew
      from ranch work dating back to the Spanish vaqueros in the 1700s. The sport was
      officially organized in 1929 and, by the 1930s, championships were determined and
      the sport of rodeo surpassed baseball and auto racing in spectator attendance.
      Since then, sponsorship has grown, resulting in extensive worldwide popularity
      through major media outlets. Despite growing popularity, few investigations exist
      regarding the scientific aspects of the sport. Rodeo competition is an activity
      that is basically intermittent in nature, with short periods of highly intense
      activity. When considering that experience and, thus, improvement in rodeo is
      achieved solely through constant and punishing practices involving actual and
      repetitive, human versus livestock competition, the practices closely imitate a
      sport-specific form of interval training. Studies, which address the
      anthropometric and performance characteristics of rodeo competitors, reveal that 
      they are comparable to athletes in more traditional sports. The psychological
      constructs conducive to performance in rodeo have been varied and limited, with
      most research efforts focused on personality characteristics, sensation seeking
      and competitive anxiety. Nevertheless, when evaluated relative to higher levels
      of traditional sport performance, rodeo participants closely resemble their
      mainstream counterparts. Although efforts to quantify this non-traditional sport 
      are still in the initial stages, information concerning what the optimal fitness 
      level of rodeo athletes should be for maximal performance levels, in a basically 
      anaerobic sport, remains to be determined and is an area for future study. Rodeo 
      performance, as with all sports, is based on a multifactorial array of variables 
      and, therefore, interdisciplinary efforts encompassing expertise across medicine,
      science and coaching are encouraged. Taking a comprehensive approach in the
      assessment of athletes, as well as the development and quantification of
      event-specific training protocols, may ultimately enhance athletic potential,
      minimize opportunity for injury and possibly provide information to coaches and
      allied health professionals for the appropriate development and optimal medical
      care of these athletes.

PG  - 101-6
LID - 10.3810/psm.2010.04.1767 [doi]
AB  - Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) is hyponatremia that occurs <or= 24 hours 
      after prolonged physical activity. It is a potentially serious complication of
      marathons, triathlons, and ultradistance events, and can occur in hot and cold
      environments. Clear evidence indicates that EAH is a dilutional hyponatremia
      caused by excessive fluid consumption and the inappropriate release of arginine
      vasopressin. Cerebral and pulmonary edema can cause serious signs and symptoms,
      including altered mental status, respiratory distress, seizures, coma, and death.
      Rapid diagnosis and urgent treatment with hypertonic saline is necessary to
      prevent severe complications or death. Prevention is based on educating athletes 
      to avoid excessive drinking before, during, and after exercise.

TI  - An analysis of practice activities and instructional behaviours used by youth
      soccer coaches during practice: exploring the link between science and
      application.
PG  - 483-95
LID - 10.1080/02640410903582750 [doi]
AB  - We examined the practice activities and instructional behaviours employed by 25
      youth soccer coaches during 70 different practice sessions. We evaluated the
      extent to which these activities and behaviours differ from those shown in
      contemporary research to best facilitate skill acquisition. Nine coaches worked
      with the under-9 years age group and eight coaches each with the under-13 and
      under-16 years age groups; nine of those coaches were employed at the elite
      level, nine at the sub-elite level, and seven at the non-elite level. Coaches had
      players spend more time in activities that were deemed less relevant to soccer
      match performance, termed "training form" (e.g. physical training, technique and 
      skills practices), than activities deemed more relevant, termed "playing form"
      (e.g. small-sided/conditioned games and phase of play activities). Coaches
      provided high levels of instruction, feedback, and management, irrespective of
      the activity in which players engaged. Few differences in practice activities and
      instructional behaviours were reported across skill and age groups, implying the 
      absence of any notable age- or skill-related progression. Findings are discussed 
      with reference to recent research in the areas of skill acquisition, motor
      learning, and expert performance.

TI  - Associations between sport and screen-entertainment with mental health problems
      in 5-year-old children.
PG  - 30
LID - 10.1186/1479-5868-7-30 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined the benefits of regular physical activity, 
      and risks of sedentary behaviour, in young children. This study investigated
      associations between participation in sports and screen-entertainment (as
      components of physical activity and sedentary behaviour), and emotional and
      behavioural problems in this population. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of
      data from 13470 children (50.9% boys) participating in the nationally
      representative UK Millennium Cohort Study. Time spent participating in sports
      clubs outside of school, and using screen-entertainment, was reported by the
      child's mother at child age 5 years, when mental health was also measured using
      the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. RESULTS: 45% of children did not
      participate in sport clubs and 61% used screen-entertainment for >/= 2 hours per 
      day. Children who participated in sport had fewer total difficulties; emotional, 
      conduct, hyperactivity-inattention and peer relationship problems; and more
      prosocial behaviours. These relationships were similar in boys and girls. Boys
      and girls who used screen-entertainment for any duration, and participated in
      sport, had fewer emotional and behavioural problems, and more prosocial
      behaviours, than children who used screen-entertainment for >/= 2 hours per day
      and did not participate in sport. CONCLUSIONS: Longer durations of
      screen-entertainment usage are not associated with mental health problems in
      young children. However, our findings suggest an association between sport and
      better mental health. Further research based on longitudinal data is required to 
      examine causal pathways in these associations and to determine the potential role
      of this and other forms of physical activity in preventing mental health
      disorders.

TI  - Mental toughness profiles and their relations with achievement goals and sport
      motivation in adolescent Australian footballers.
PG  - 615-25
LID - 10.1080/02640410903582792 [doi]
AB  - The aims of this study were to identify the mental toughness profiles of
      adolescent Australian footballers and to explore the relations between the mental
      toughness clusters and achievement goals and sport motivation. A total of 214
      non-elite, male Australian footballers aged 16-18 years (mean = 16.8, s = 0.7)
      provided self-reports of mental toughness, achievement goals, and sport
      motivation. Cluster analysis supported the presence of two-groups in which
      players evidenced moderate and high levels of all four mental toughness
      subscales. Significant multivariate effects were observed for achievement goals
      and sport motivation with the high mental toughness group favouring both mastery-
      and performance-approach goals and self-determined as well as extrinsic
      motivational tendencies. The results suggest that adolescent Australian
      footballers' self-perceptions of mental toughness fall within two clusters
      involving high and moderate forms of all four components, and that these profiles
      show varying relations with achievement goals (particularly mastery-approach) and
      sport motivation.

TI  - Talent development in adolescent team sports: a review.
PG  - 103-16
AB  - Traditional talent development pathways for adolescents in team sports follow
      talent identification procedures based on subjective games ratings and isolated
      athletic assessment. Most talent development models are exclusive rather than
      inclusive in nature. Subsequently, talent identification may result in
      discontentment, premature stratification, or dropout from team sports.
      Understanding the multidimensional differences among the requirements of
      adolescent and elite adult athletes could provide more realistic goals for
      potential talented players. Coach education should include adolescent
      development, and rewards for team success at the adolescent level should reflect 
      the needs of long-term player development. Effective talent development needs to 
      incorporate physical and psychological maturity, the relative age effect,
      objective measures of game sense, and athletic prowess. The influences of media
      and culture on the individual, and the competing time demands between various
      competitions for player training time should be monitored and mediated where
      appropriate. Despite the complexity, talent development is a worthy investment in
      professional team sport.

TI  - Evaluation of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's concussion
      initiative for high school coaches: "Heads Up: Concussion in High School Sports".
PG  - 112-8
LID - 10.1111/j.1746-1561.2010.00491.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To reduce the number of sports-related concussions, the Centers for
      Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), with the support of partners and experts in
      the field, has developed a tool kit for high school coaches with practical,
      easy-to-use concussion-related information. This study explores the success of
      the tool kit in changing knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to the
      prevention and management of concussions. METHODS: A mail questionnaire was
      administered to all eligible high school coaches who received the tool kit.
      Follow-up focus groups were conducted for additional information. Both
      quantitative data from the surveys and qualitative data from the focus groups
      were analyzed to support the objectives of the study. RESULTS: Respondents
      self-reported favorable changes in knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward the
      prevention and management of concussions. Qualitative responses augmented the
      quantitative data. CONCLUSION: Barriers to concussion prevention and management
      are complex; however, these results highlight the role that coaches can play in
      school settings in establishing a safe environment for their athletes.

TI  - Coaching: an effective leadership intervention.
PG  - 39-48
LID - 10.1016/j.cnur.2009.11.001 [doi]
AB  - Organizations are transitioning from a management industrial era to a humanistic 
      era. This transition will require a different set of leadership competencies.
      Competencies that reflect relationships, connections with employees, and having
      the skill to unleash the human capability at all levels of an organization are
      essential. Similar to when a sports team needs a different play book to be
      successful, leaders need a new play book. Coaches within the sports team are the 
      ones who assist players in learning how to adapt to a different set of rules.
      They teach the players how to show up differently and how to implement different 
      plays, with the overall goal of being a successful team. New competencies are
      being required to reflect a humanistic approach to leadership. It is critical
      that organizations offer coaching as an intervention to all levels of leadership.
      This actual case study demonstrates that coaching not only assisted leaders in
      learning a new way of leading but also improved overall organizational
      effectiveness. The results that have been accomplished through the use of
      implementing a 360-degree feedback system, with coaching, reaped overall
      organization improvement.

TI  - The effect of coaching intervention on elite fast bowling technique over a two
      year period.
PG  - 261-74
LID - 10.1080/14763140903469908 [doi]
AB  - Fast bowling in cricket is an activity that is well recognised as having high
      injury prevalence and there has been debate regarding the most effective fast
      bowling technique. The aim of this study was to determine whether two-year
      coaching interventions conducted in a group of elite young fast bowlers resulted 
      in fast bowling technique alteration. Selected kinematics of the bowling action
      of 14 elite young fast bowlers were measured using an 18 camera Vicon Motion
      Analysis system before and after two-year coaching interventions that addressed
      specific elements of fast bowling technique. Mann-Whitney tests were used to
      determine whether any changes in kinematic variables occurred pre- and
      post-intervention between those who had the coaching interventions and those who 
      didn't. The coaching interventions, when applied, resulted in a more side-on
      shoulder alignment at back foot contact (BFC) (p = 0.002) and decreased shoulder 
      counter-rotation (p = 0.001) however, there was no difference in the degree of
      change in back and front knee flexion angles or lower trunk side-flexion. This
      study has clearly shown that specific aspects of fast bowling technique are
      changeable over a two-year period in elite level fast bowlers and this may be
      attributed to coaching intervention.

PG  - 129-36

AB  - Previous researches have established models that specify psychological factors
      that could predict sport injuries. One example is Williams and Andersen's
      stress-injury model stressing factors such as anxiety, negative life stress and
      few coping resources. The purpose of the current study was to find psychological 
      factors that could lead to an increased injury risk among junior soccer players, 
      in addition to construct an empirical model of injury risk factors for soccer
      players. The participants were 108 male and female soccer players (m=17, 6)
      studying at soccer high schools in southwest Sweden. Five questionnaires were
      used, State Trait Anxiety Inventory, Sport Anxiety Scale, Life Events Survey for 
      Collegiate Athletes, Athletic Coping Skills Inventory-28 and Swedish universities
      Scales of Personality. Injury record was collected by athletic trainers at the
      schools during a period of 8 months. The result suggested four significant
      predictors that together could explain 23% of injury occurrence. The main factors
      are life event stress, somatic trait anxiety, mistrust and ineffective coping.
      These findings partly support Williams and Andersen's stress-injury model and are
      organized into an empirical model. Recommendations are given to sport medicine
      teams and coaches concerning issues in sport injury prevention.

PG  - 423-34
LID - 10.1080/02640410903536442 [doi]
AB  - In the present study, we examined an expanded model of sport commitment by adding
      two determinants (perceived costs and perceived competence) and behavioural
      commitment as a consequence of psychological commitment, as well as identifying
      psychological commitment as a mediator of relationships between determinants and 
      behavioural commitment. Competitive female gymnasts (N = 304, age 8-18 years)
      completed relevant measures while coaches rated each gymnast's training
      behaviours as an indicator of behavioural commitment. Path analysis revealed that
      the best fitting model was one in which original determinants (enjoyment,
      involvement opportunities, investments, attractive alternatives) and an added
      determinant (perceived costs) predicted psychological commitment, in addition to 
      investments and perceived costs directly predicting behavioural commitment. These
      results provide further, but partial, support for the sport commitment model and 
      also suggest that additional determinants and behavioural consequences be
      considered in future research.

TI  - Coaching behaviors, motivational climate, and psychosocial outcomes among female 
      adolescent athletes.
PG  - 475-92
AB  - Based on Harter's (12,13) competence motivation theory, this study examined the
      relationship of coaches' performance feedback and motivational climate with
      female athletes' perceived competence, enjoyment, and intrinsic motivation.
      Female adolescent soccer players (N = 141) completed measures of relevant
      constructs toward the latter part of their season. Canonical correlation analysis
      revealed that athletes' perceptions of greater positive and informational
      feedback given by coaches in response to successful performance attempts, greater
      emphasis placed on a mastery climate, and less emphasis placed on a performance
      climate, were significantly related to greater ability perceptions, enjoyment,
      and intrinsic motivation. Exploratory analyses also showed that the relationship 
      between feedback and the psychosocial outcomes may vary as a function of the
      perceived motivational climate. Overall, these results suggest that coaching
      feedback and motivational climate are important contributors to explaining
      adolescent females' continued motivation to participate in sport.

TI  - Why do we follow sporting events?
PG  - 1065-70
AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate the motives for following sporting events
      and their dependence upon gender and age of spectators. The study was based on a 
      survey of 1727 adult Slovenes. According to the results the most important
      motives could be classified in the category of Dionysian values. This means that 
      the role of sport in a spectator's life is not that influential; it is much more 
      considered a source of relaxation and pleasure. Higher values of all motives were
      given by men. Women found the motive "National importance of sport" more
      important, while the motives "Attraction of sports" and "Competitiveness,
      fighting spirit, victory" were placed higher by men. Younger spectators evaluated
      the motives higher, with motives "Pleasure, Entertainment" and "Sport Dynamism"
      being most important. The data reveal those attributes of sport that have always 
      caught and will also continue to catch the eye of the spectators.

TI  - Sports and games for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
PG  - CD007171
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD007171.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Traumatic experiences evoke emotions such as fear, anxiety and
      distress and may encourage avoidance of similar situations in the future. For a
      proportion of those exposed to a traumatic event, this emotional reaction becomes
      uncontrollable and can develop into Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
      (Breslau 2001). Most of those diagnosed with PTSD fully recover while a small
      proportion develop a chronic PTSD a year after the event (First 2004). Sports and
      games may be able to alleviate symptoms of PTSD. OBJECTIVES: PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:
      1. To assess the effectiveness of sports, and games in alleviating and/or
      diminishing the symptoms of PTSD when compared to usual care or other
      interventions. SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: 2. To assess the effectiveness of different
      types of sports and games in alleviating and/or diminishing symptoms of PTSD.
      SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis
      Controlled Trials Registers (CCDAN-CTR) were searched up to June 2008.The
      following databases were searched up to June 2008: the Cochrane Central registry 
      of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; EMBASE; CINAHL; PsycINFO. Reference lists of
      relevant papers were searched and experts in the field were contacted to
      determine if other studies were available. SELECTION CRITERIA: To be included,
      participants had to be diagnosed with PTSD using criteria outlined in the
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM IV) and/or ICD
      criteria. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that considered one or more
      well-specified sports or games for alleviating and/or diminishing symptoms of
      PTSD were included.Sports, and games were defined as any organized physical
      activity done alone or with a group and non-physical activities such as computer 
      games and card games done alone or with a group. Psychological interventions such
      as music therapy, art therapy and play therapy and behavioural therapy were
      excluded. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers (SL and MD) separately
      checked the titles and abstracts of the search results to determine which studies
      met the pre-determined inclusion criteria. A flow chart was used to guide the
      selection process. No studies met the inclusion criteria. MAIN RESULTS: The
      search strategy identified five papers but none of the studies met inclusion
      criteria. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: No studies met the inclusion criteria. More
      research is therefore required before a fair assessment can be made of the
      effectiveness of sports and games in alleviating symptoms of PTSD.

TI  - Psychiatric conditions in sports: diagnosis, treatment, and quality of life.
PG  - 29-34
AB  - The social stigma surrounding psychiatric illness may prevent athletes from
      seeking counseling, psychotherapy, medication, or other treatment when needed.
      Few controlled studies on athletes exist to guide the team physician, clinician, 
      or psychiatrist who must deal with diagnostic issues. Management involves setting
      realistic goals, educating as well as inducing the patient into treatment,
      soliciting support from family or significant others, and delivering appropriate 
      treatment (the most difficult task). The objective is to improve performance and 
      quality of life. Confidentiality issues are paramount during diagnosis and
      treatment. Physicians who understand sports and team dynamics may have more
      success in helping patients follow through with treatment.

      on Concussion in Sport held in Zurich, November 2008.
PG  - 141-59
LID - 10.3810/psm.2009.06.1721 [doi]
AB  - This paper is a revision and update of the recommendations developed following
      the 1st (Vienna) and 2nd (Prague) International Symposia on Concussion in Sport. 
      The Zurich Consensus statement is designed to build on the principles outlined in
      the original Vienna and Prague documents and to develop further conceptual
      understanding of this problem using a formal consensus-based approach. A detailed
      description of the consensus process is outlined at the end of this document
      under the "background" section (see Section 11). This document is developed for
      use by physicians, therapists, certified athletic trainers, health professionals,
      coaches and other people involved in the care of injured athletes, whether at the
      recreational, elite, or professional level. While agreement exists pertaining to 
      principal messages conveyed within this document, the authors acknowledge that
      the science of concussion is evolving, and therefore management and
      return-to-play (RTP) decisions remain in the realm of clinical judgment on an
      individualized basis. Readers are encouraged to copy and distribute freely the
      Zurich Consensus document and/or the Sports Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT2)
      card, and neither is subject to any copyright restriction. The authors request,
      however, that the document and/or the SCAT2 card be distributed in their full and
      complete format.

TI  - Interactive effects of team cohesion on perceived efficacy in semi-professional
      sport.
PG  - 320-5
AB  - The present study examined the relationships among cohesion, self-efficacy,
      coaches' perceptions of their players' efficacy at the individual level and
      athletes' perceptions of their teammates' efficacy. Participants (n = 76)
      recruited from four semi- professional soccer and basketball teams completed
      cohesiveness and efficacy questionnaires who. Data were analyzed through a
      correlational methodology. Results indicated significant correlations between
      self-efficacy and task cohesion and social cohesion. Regression analysis results 
      suggest task cohesion positively related to coaches and teammate's perception of 
      efficacy. These results have implications for practitioners in terms of the
      importance of team building to enhance team cohesion and feelings of efficacy.
      Key pointsThis paper increases the knowledge about soccer and basketball match
      analysis.Give normative values to establish practice and match objectives.Give
      applications ideas to connect research with coaches' practice.

TI  - Portuguese Coaches' Perceptions of and Preferences for Knowledge Sources Related 
      to their Professional Background.
PG  - 480-9
AB  - The purpose of this study was to analyse Portuguese coaches' perceptions of, and 
      preferences for, knowledge sources as related to professional background; namely 
      academic education level, coach education level and coaching experience. The
      study's participants comprised 336 Portuguese coaches from twenty-two sports. A
      questionnaire was used to identify coaches' demographic characteristics and
      representations about their preferred sources of coaching knowledge. MANOVA using
      Tukey's HSD test was used to compare groups. The results highlighted that coaches
      perceived that coaching knowledge is built from a broad range of sources from
      personal coaching and playing experiences to more explicit formal, informal and
      non-formal learning situations. Results indicated that the coaches ascribed more 
      importance to experiential sources such as working with experts, learning by
      doing, interacting with peer coaches and attending informal seminars and clinics,
      than to the formal learning situations provided by the national coaching
      certification programs. Differences, however, were found in that coaches who had 
      a greater background within higher education (physical) and sport valued informal
      and non-formal learning sources more than did coaches who were defined as not
      coming from an academic background. The findings point to the importance of
      developing new learning, experientially-based, opportunities within the
      Portuguese context, where curricula content continues to be delivered via
      didactic means. Key pointsCoaches recognized that learning is obtained from a
      broad range of sources of coaching knowledge and each source has a particular
      role in the development of a coach.Experiential guided sources reached more
      importance to coaches as working with experts, learning by doing, attending
      seminars/clinics outside of the formal system and interaction with peers were the
      most acknowledged.The only source that is related to formal learning, national
      certification programs, was recognized as the less importance than all informal
      and non-formal learning situations.The profile of the source of coaching
      knowledge showed to be stable among coaches as only the academic education level 
      differentiated the coaches' perceptions.

TI  - Coaches' perceptions of competence and acknowledgement of training needs related 
      to professional competences.
PG  - 62-70
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to examine coaches' perceptions of
      competence and acknowledgement of training needs related to professional
      competences according to the professional experience and academic education. The 
      participants were 343 coaches from several sports, who answered to a
      questionnaire that includes a scale focused on perceptions of competence and
      another scale on acknowledgment of training needs. An exploratory factor analysis
      with Maximum Likelihood Factoring was used with Oblimin rotation for the
      identification of emergent factors. Comparison on coaches' perceptions in
      function of coaching experience and coaches' academic background were made
      applying One-way ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc multiple comparisons. Factor analysis
      on coaches' perceptions of competence and acknowledgement of training needs made 
      apparent three main areas of competences, i.e. competences related to annual and 
      multi-annual planning; competences related to orientation towards practice and
      competition; and personal and coaching education competences. Coaches'
      perceptions were influenced by their experience, as low experienced coaches rated
      themselves at lower levels of competence and with more training needs; also
      coaches with high education, in Physical Education or others, perceived
      themselves as more competent than coaches with no higher education. Finally, the 
      majority of the coaches perceived themselves to be competent but, nevertheless,
      they indicated to have training needs, which brings an important feedback to
      coach education. This suggests that coaches are interested in increasing their
      knowledge and competence in a broad range of areas which should be considered in 
      future coach education programs. Key pointsCoaches' perceptions of competence and
      acknowledgement of training needs resulted in three main areas: competences
      related to annual and multi-annual planning, competences related to practice and 
      competition orientation and, finally, personal and coaching education
      competences.The professional tasks that coaches had the most need in performing
      were related to the training orientation.Coaches with higher education degrees
      (P.E. or others) perceive themselves as more competent than coaches with no
      higher education.Low experienced coaches perceived themselves less competent than
      high experienced coaches. Also, they pointed out more training needs in issues
      related to practice and competition orientation, and annual and multi-annual
      planning.

TI  - Prediction of sport adherence through the influence of autonomy-supportive
      coaching among spanish adolescent athletes.
PG  - 8-14
AB  - The purpose of this study was to test a motivational model of the coach-athlete
      relationship, based on self-determination theory and on the hierarchical model of
      intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. The sample comprised of 608 athletes (ages of
      12-17 years) completed the following measures: interest in athlete's input,
      praise for autonomous behavior, perceived autonomy, intrinsic motivation, and the
      intention to be physically active. Structural equation modeling results
      demonstrated that interest in athletes' input and praise for autonomous behavior 
      predicted perceived autonomy, and perceived autonomy positively predicted
      intrinsic motivation. Finally, intrinsic motivation predicted the intention to be
      physically active in the future. The results are discussed in relation to the
      importance of the climate of autonomy support created by the coach on intrinsic
      motivation and adherence to sport by adolescent athletes. Further, the results
      provide information related to the possible objectives of future interventions
      for the education of coaches, with the goal of providing them with tools and
      strategies to favor the development of intrinsic motivation among their athletes.
      In conclusion, the climate of autonomy support created by the coach can predict
      the autonomy perceived by the athletes which predicts the intrinsic motivation
      experienced by the athletes, and therefore, their adherence to athletic practice.
      Key pointsImportance of the climate of autonomy support created by the coach on

AB  - A prototype system for monitoring, transmitting and processing performance data
      in sports for the purpose of providing feedback has been developed. During
      training, athletes are equipped with a mobile device and wireless sensors using
      the ANT protocol in order to acquire biomechanical, physiological and other
      sports specific parameters. The measured data is buffered locally and forwarded
      via the Internet to a server. The server provides experts (coaches,
      biomechanists, sports medicine specialists etc.) with remote data access,
      analysis and (partly automated) feedback routines. In this way, experts are able 
      to analyze the athlete's performance and return individual feedback messages from
      remote locations.

TI  - Psychological stress in sports coaches: a review of concepts, research, and
      practice.
PG  - 127-37
LID - 10.1080/02640410903406208 [doi]
AB  - Sports coaches operate within a complex, ever-changing environment that imposes
      many pressures on them. Here, we address the psychological impact of these
      demands via a critical review of the literature pertaining to stress in sport
      coaches. The narrative is divided into three main sections: (1) conceptual and
      definitional issues, (2) theoretical and empirical issues, and (3) implications
      for applied practice. The review focuses on the environmental stressors that
      coaches encounter, their appraisals of and responses to these demands, and the
      impact this has on their personal well-being and job performance. The influence
      of various personal and situational characteristics is also discussed. A key
      message to emerge from this review is that the potential health and performance
      costs of psychological stress to sports coaches are significant. The rapid rate
      of change in contemporary sport and the dynamic nature of stress mean that stress
      in coaches is an ongoing problem that needs to be monitored and addressed.

TI  - How the number of years of sports experience and the frequency of sports
      activities can influence the quality of life of people with challenges.
PG  - 19-26
AB  - The present study focused on the users of sports centres for people with
      challenges to identify the relationship between sports activities and quality of 
      life (QOL) of the users. A centre established in H Prefecture in 1996 (Centre H) 
      and another in T Prefecture in 2006 (Centre T) were studied to find out how
      differences in the number of years of sports experience and frequency of sports
      activities could affect QOL scores of the 36-Item Medical Outcomes Study
      Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). The examination of the relationship between the
      number of years of sports experience and the total QOL scores of the respondents 
      at both centres revealed significantly better QOL scores on the bodily pain (BP) 
      and role emotional (RE) scales among the respondents with three or more years of 
      sports experience, compared to those with less than three years of sports
      experience. On the whole, the higher the number of years of sports experience and
      the greater the frequency of sports activities, the better the QOL scores were.
      These results suggest that sports activities contribute greatly to the
      improvement of the everyday QOL of challenged individuals and long years of
      frequent sports activities have a beneficial impact on the QOL of
      physically-challenged individuals.

TI  - Evaluation of a mental health literacy training program for junior sporting
      clubs.
PG  - 475-479
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to describe and evaluate a training program 
      designed to improve mental health literacy in junior sporting club coaches and
      leaders. It was anticipated that participants would demonstrate an improvement in
      knowledge, confidence, and attitudes in relation to mental disorders and help
      seeking. Methods: A training program called Read the Play was delivered to 40
      participants from junior AFL football and netball leagues in the Barwon region of
      Victoria. The effects of the training were evaluated using pre- and
      post-questionnaires. Results: The course led to significant improvement in
      knowledge about mental disorders, increased confidence in helping someone with a 
      mental disorder and more positive attitudes towards people with mental disorders.
      Conclusions: Training programs delivered within sporting settings may be
      effective in improving mental health literacy. Future evaluations would benefit
      from assessing whether these changes are sustained over time and whether trainees
      subsequently assist young club members to seek appropriate professional help.

AB  - Given the social nature of participation in sport, we hypothesized that club
      sports participants would have greater well-being and quality of life than
      participants in other forms of physical activity (PA). PURPOSE: The purpose of
      this study was to examine health-related quality of life and life satisfaction in
      women who participate in three contrasting forms of PA: club sport, gym
      activities, and walking. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of the
      relationship between type of PA setting and measures of health-related quality of
      life (Short-Form Health Survey [SF-36]) and life satisfaction in 818 women living
      in rural Victoria, Australia, in 2007. Data were also compared with those from a 
      normative sample of 2345 women. RESULTS: After adjustment for potential
      confounders (age, education, marital status, children aged <16 yr, perceived
      financial stress, and level of recreational PA), four of the eight SF-36
      subscales, the SF-36 mental health component summary score, and life satisfaction
      were significantly higher in the club sport group than that in the other groups. 
      CONCLUSION: Although cross-sectional research cannot establish causal links, the 
      results suggest that participation in club sport may enhance the health benefits 
      of PA.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Ice hockey is a fast-paced sport played by an increasing
      number of children and teens across the nation. RECENT FINDINGS: The risk of
      injury in youth hockey is high due to contact from body checking. Youth hockey
      programs need to educate players, coaches, and parents about the importance of
      knowing and following the rules as well as the dangers of body checking another
      player from behind. SUMMARY: In this article, we will present an overview of the 
      types and rates of injuries that occur in ice hockey and then present a detailed 
      review of hip/groin injuries that are commonly diagnosed in these athletes.

TI  - The sports and exercise life-course: a survival analysis of recall data from
      Ireland.
PG  - 711-9
LID - 10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.11.006 [doi]
AB  - Recall data from a representative sample of 3080 adults in Ireland in 2003 is
      used to investigate transitions into and out of regular participation in sports
      and exercise--an important contributor to overall physical activity. The method
      produces a continuous picture of participation across the life-course, allowing
      key transition periods in the life-course to be identified and the determinants
      of transitions to be analysed with multivariate models. Late adolescence emerges 
      as an important period, when many people drop out from team sports, especially
      females. Participation in adulthood mostly involves taking up individual sports
      and exercise activities. The likelihood of making this transition is strongly
      associated with socio-economic status. Transitions in activity during adulthood
      do not display significant sex differences, suggesting that the gender gap for
      involvement in sports and exercise has its roots in childhood. The method also
      allows age and cohort effects to be distinguished, revealing higher participation
      among more recent cohorts. The findings must be interpreted carefully, since they
      are reliant on the accuracy of personal recall. Yet they have implications for
      how physical activity policy applies over the life-course, suggesting possible
      returns to targeting lower socio-economic groups in early adulthood, to offering 
      a broader range of activities to young females, and to researching and promoting 
      those activities most likely to be of interest to current young adults as they
      age.

TI  - 'I am in blood Stepp'd in so far...': ethical dilemmas and the sports team
      doctor.
PG  - 175-8
LID - 10.1136/bjsm.2009.068056 [doi]
AB  - There are many ethical dilemmas that are unique to sports medicine because of the
      unusual clinical environment of caring for players within the context of a team
      whose primary objective is to win. Many of these ethical issues arise because the
      traditional relationship between doctor and patient is distorted or absent. The
      emergence of a doctor-patient-team triad has created a scenario in which the
      team's priority can conflict with or even replace the doctor's primary obligation
      to player well-being. As a result, the customary ethical norms that provide
      guidelines for most forms of clinical practice, such as patient autonomy and
      confidentiality, are not easily translated in the field of sports medicine.
      Sports doctors are frequently under intense pressure, whether implicit or
      explicit, from management, coaches, trainers and agents, to improve performance
      of the athlete in the short term rather than considering the long-term sequelae
      of such decisions. A myriad of ethical dilemmas are encountered, and for many of 
      these dilemmas there are no right answers. In this article, a number of ethical
      principles and how they relate to sports medicine are discussed. To conclude, a
      list of guidelines has been drawn up to offer some support to doctors facing an
      ethical quandary, the most important of which is 'do not abdicate your
      responsibility to the individual player.''I am in blood Stepp'd in so far that,
      should I wade no more, Returning would be as tedious as to go o'er' -Macbeth: Act
      III, Scene IV, William Shakespeare.

AB  - The job of a strength and conditioning coach is to prepare athletes for a
      successful outcome in their sport. Methods must be grounded in science and proved
      effective through research and trial and error. A comprehensive sports
      performance team includes physician, physical therapist, or athletic trainer;
      strength and conditioning coach; sport coach; and, when possible, sports
      psychologist and sports nutritionist. This article serves to help members of a
      sports performance team gain an understanding of the role of a strength and

AB  - Determining the criteria for an injured athlete's return to competition can be a 
      confusing scenario when all the individuals involved are brought in. These may
      include the athlete, parents, guardians, coaches, family physician, the athletic 
      trainer, and others. Providing a foundation from which all can understand the
      reasoning is key. It must be understood that the primary responsibility is to
      cause no harm to the athlete, while enabling him or her to participate at the
      highest level possible. This article discusses the importance of establishing
      guidelines, athletes' behavioral responses to RTP decisions, testing procedures, 
      and the level of sport and intangible factors related to RTP criteria.

TI  - A comparison of high school sports injury surveillance data reporting by
      certified athletic trainers and coaches.
PG  - 645-52
LID - 10.4085/1062-6050-44.6.645 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: High school athletes sustain more than 1.4 million injuries annually.
      National high school sports injury surveillance forms the foundation for
      developing and evaluating preventive interventions to reduce injury rates. For
      national surveillance, individuals must report consistently and accurately with
      little one-on-one interaction with study staff. OBJECTIVE: To examine the
      feasibility of relying on high school coaches as data reporters in a national,
      Internet-based sports injury surveillance study, using the same methods that have
      already proven successful in the National High School Sports-Related Injury
      Surveillance Study, which calls on certified athletic trainers (ATs) as
      reporters. DESIGN: Prospective injury surveillance study. SETTING: Eighteen
      United States high schools PARTICIPANTS: Athletic trainers and varsity coaches
      for football, boys' and girls' soccer, and boys' and girls' basketball. MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Quantity and quality of exposure and injury reports. RESULTS:
      All enrolled ATs participated, compared with only 43.0% of enrolled coaches.
      Participating ATs submitted 96.7% of expected exposure reports, whereas
      participating coaches submitted only 36.5%. All ATs reported athlete exposures
      correctly, compared with only 2 in 3 coaches. Participating ATs submitted 338
      injury reports; participating coaches submitted only 55 (16.3% of the 338
      submitted by ATs). Injury patterns differed between AT-submitted and
      coach-submitted injury reports, with ATs reporting a higher proportion of ankle
      injuries and coaches reporting a higher proportion of knee injuries. The reports 
      submitted by ATs and coaches for the same injury had low agreement for diagnosis 
      and time loss, with only 63.2% and 55.3% of pairs, respectively, providing the
      same response. The ATs lacked more responses for demographic questions, whereas
      coaches lacked more responses regarding the need for surgery. CONCLUSIONS:
      Whenever possible, ATs should be the primary data reporters in large, national
      studies. In high schools without access to an AT, researchers must be willing to 
      devote significant time and resources to achieving high participation and
      compliance from other reporters.

      learning in adolescents with mental retardation.
PG  - 81-6
LID - 10.1016/j.ridd.2009.07.022 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of five variations of
      imagery and physical practice on learning of Basketball free throws in
      adolescents with mental retardation (AWMR). Forty AWMR were randomly assigned to 
      five groups and performed a variation of practice: physical practice, mental
      practice, physical practice followed by mental practice, mental practice followed
      by physical practice, and no practice. The groups exercised the task for 24
      sessions. Following training, posttest and retention test were taken. All
      variations of practice resulted in performance improvement, yet the mental
      practice followed by physical practice resulted in better improvement. The
      results suggest that mental practice associated with physical practice results in
      an outstanding performance improvement in AWMR.

TI  - Heat injury in youth sport.
PG  - 8-12
LID - 10.1136/bjsm.2009.068171 [doi]
AB  - Heat injury is a potentially lethal condition that is considered to be completely
      preventable. Fatal heat injury is relatively rare (0.20 per 100 000
      player-seasons in US high school football) and there are very limited data on
      non-fatal incidence. Expert recommendations for prevention include gradual
      acclimatisation of youth athletes to hot conditions, reductions in activity in
      hot and humid conditions, wearing light and light-coloured clothing, careful
      monitoring of athletes for signs of heat injury to facilitate immediate
      detection, having the resources to immediately and rapidly cool affected
      athletes, and education of athletes, care givers, and coaches about heat injury. 
      Although a base of observational case data, physiological information, and expert
      opinion exists, the science surrounding this field is devoid of health
      communication and health behaviour research, and there is a pressing need for
      analytical studies to evaluate intervention programmes and/or identify new risk
      factors. There is also a need for ongoing data collection on heat injury
      incidence and on the knowledge, attitudes and behaviours towards heat injury
      among youth athletes, their care givers and their coaches.

TI  - Divine service, music, sport, and recreation as medicinal in Australian asylums
      1860s-1945.
PG  - 128-48
AB  - Australian asylum records (circa 1860 to circa 1945) demonstrate that medical
      staff went to great lengths to provide recreation to suitable patients. This
      article examines how the demarcation of Australian institutional spaces along
      gender divisions was also mirrored by the gender-specific recreational activities
      provided in purpose-built facilities. Using Australian examples I demonstrate how
      the main forms of recreation-that is divine service, music and dance, and
      sport-were justified to governments on medical grounds. Some designated
      recreational spaces even offered select female and male patients the opportunity 
      to mix under medical supervision. Recreation was therapeutic because of its
      psychological, physical, social, and moral benefits, and government authorities
      funded the construction of costly chapels, recreation halls, and sports grounds
      expressly for this medical purpose.

TI  - Individual, team, and coach predictors of players' likelihood to aggress in youth
      soccer.
PG  - 425-43
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine personal and socioenvironmental factors 
      of players' likelihood to aggress. Participants were youth soccer players (N =
      258) and their coaches (N = 23) from high school and club teams. Players
      completed the Judgments About Moral Behavior in Youth Sports Questionnaire
      (JAMBYSQ; Stephens, Bredemeier, & Shields, 1997), which assessed athletes' stage 
      of moral development, team norm for aggression, and self-described likelihood to 
      aggress against an opponent. Coaches were administered the Coaching Efficacy
      Scale (CES; Feltz, Chase, Moritz, & Sullivan, 1999). Using multilevel modeling,
      results demonstrated that the team norm for aggression at the athlete and team
      level were significant predictors of athletes' self likelihood to aggress scores.
      Further, coaches' game strategy efficacy emerged as a positive predictor of their
      players' self-described likelihood to aggress. The findings contribute to
      previous research examining the socioenvironmental predictors of athletic
      aggression in youth sport by demonstrating the importance of coaching efficacy
      beliefs.

AB  - A total of 288 high school coaches completed a survey on their attitudes toward
      and involvement in alcohol prevention among male high school athletes. Results
      indicated that coaches felt alcohol use was less of a problem among high school
      student-athletes than high school students in general. Only one-third of coaches 
      (39%) worked at a school requiring them to talk to their athletes about alcohol
      use. Coaches most likely to be involved in alcohol prevention were those who had 
      attended an alcohol prevention class/workshop and those who worked for schools
      with strong alcohol prevention policies and schools that required them to talk
      with athletes about alcohol use.

TI  - Understanding the relationship between perceived development of the competition
      plan and sport performance: mediating effects of self-efficacy and state
      depression.
PG  - 304-14
AB  - The effectiveness of competition plans on athletes' performance outcomes was
      assessed while accounting for the mediating influence of state depression and
      self-efficacy. Competition plans reflect an integrated and personalized plan that
      consists of a set of decision-making rules based on the principles of
      self-control and self-efficacy development that are tailored to the specific
      demands of an upcoming competition in a given sport and highly individualized to 
      take into account the specific qualities of the athlete. The relationship between
      the development of a competition plan and athletes' evaluations of their
      competitive outcomes was of interest. 11 elite athletes participating in 104
      competitions involving 7 different sports participated. Results support the
      beneficial effect of a well-developed competition plan in affecting athletes'
      perceived performance; the relationship was mediated by state depression and
      self-efficacy. Coaches and sport psychologists should devote increased attention 
      to the development and refinement of athletes' precompetition performance plans
      while also considering participants' self-efficacy and mood characteristics.

      sports seasons.
PG  - 2345-50
LID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181bb7313 [doi]
AB  - Although sport for athletes with mental retardation (MR) is achieving an
      important role, literature concerning basketball test and training is still poor.
      The aims of this study were to assess basketball ability before (PRE) and after
      (POST) a 6-month training in athletes with MR across 2 sports seasons (ss) and to
      analyze the variation of basketball abilities by subjects' MR level. Fifteen
      trained basketball players with MR participated (11 men and 4 women; age range
      19-43 years; MR: 3 Mild, 8 Moderate, 3 Severe, and 1 Profound). Athletes were
      tested PRE and POST a 6-month training during 2 following sports seasons (ss1 and
      ss2). The tests assessed 4 ability levels, each one characterized by the analysis
      of 4 fundamental areas (ball handling, reception, passing, and shooting), divided
      into 5 specific components. The athletes' global score improved after training in
      both ss1 (41.5 +/- 12.0 vs. 48.6 +/- 15.4; p < 0.01) and ss2 (41.7 +/- 12.4 vs.
      50.8 +/- 16.2; p < 0.01). Levels II, III, and IV showed an increase both after
      each ss and the 2 following ss (p < 0.01). No significant difference was found
      between POST-ss1 and POST-ss2 due to score decrease during the resting period
      between the 2 ss. In both ss, global and level scores were negatively correlated 
      to MR level indicating that athletes with a lower MR obtained higher ability
      scores. In conclusion, a 6-month training caused a general improvement,
      especially evident in levels II and III in both ss. Global and level scores were 
      negatively correlated to MR level (p < 0.05) indicating that athletes with a
      lower MR obtained higher scores. Therefore, the basketball test battery could be 
      useful for improving and monitoring training.

AB  - The study examined the psychometric properties of the Belgian coach version of
      the Coach-Athlete Relationship Questionnaire (CART-Q). The questionnaire includes
      three dimensions (Closeness, Commitment, and Complementarity) in a model that
      intends to measure the quality of the coach-athlete relationship. Belgian coaches
      (n=144) of athletes who performed at various competition levels in such sports as
      football, basketball, and volleyball responded to the CART-Q and to the
      Leadership Scale for Sport (LSS). A confirmatory factor analysis proved to be
      slightly more satisfactory for a three-order factor model, compared with a
      hierarchical first-order factor model. The three factors showed acceptable
      internal consistency scores. Moreover, functional associations between the three 
      factors and coach leadership behaviors were found offering support to the
      instrument's concurrent validity. The findings support previous validation
      studies and verify the psychometric properties of the CART-Q applied to Belgian
      coaches of team sports.

AB  - Regardless of one's stance on the topic, drugs are an important issue in sports. 
      Sports pages in newspapers around the globe routinely report on athletes at every
      level ofcompetition using performance enhancing substances to gain an unfair
      advantage over their competitors. The level of sophistication in beating drug
      testing, and developing "next-generation" agents continues to raise. The relative
      paucity of well designed research has been an additional factor impeding attempts
      to adequately address the problem. Very limited funds are currently available to 
      conduct the necessary research. Without credible data, athletes are more
      vulnerable to the claims made by those benefiting from the sales of these
      compounds. Many younger fans and those dreaming of a similar future admire highly
      successful professional athletes. A strong, consistent statement admonishing drug
      use is needed. Actions speak louder than words. Every time a successful athlete
      is caught using PE drugs, every effort to diminish drug use is negatively
      impacted. The "win at all cost" and "second place is the first loser" mentality
      needs to be continually challenged by words and actions in youth sports at every 
      level of competition. Finally, the war on drugs in sports needs to be a
      coordinated, well organized international undertaking as sports play an important
      role in virtually every culture. If we are to maintain the integrity of
      competition and protect the health of the athletes, we must dramatically increase
      our efforts to eliminate performance enhancing drugs as an acceptable option for 
      any athlete. Sports science professionals and sports psychiatrists need to work
      with coaches, trainers, athletes, and national governing bodies to educating
      athletes on the effects of performance enhancing drug use. To achieve this
      important goal everyone involved in sports needs to be knowledgeable on the
      negative impact this has on all aspects of organized sports. It is a difficult
      challenge, but one that must be addressed.

TI  - Understanding the coach's role in the development of mental toughness:
      perspectives of elite Australian football coaches.
PG  - 1483-96
LID - 10.1080/02640410903150475 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore elite coaches' perceptions of how they
      can both facilitate and impede the development of key mental toughness
      characteristics in the context of Australian football. Eleven coaches from a
      previous study (Gucciardi, Gordon, & Dimmock, 2008) were re-interviewed and the
      transcribed verbatim data were analysed using grounded theory data analytical
      procedures (Strauss & Corbin, 1998). Five categories that appear to be central to
      the coach's role in the development of mental toughness in Australian football
      emerged. Four of these categories (coach-athlete relationship, coaching
      philosophy, training environments, and specific strategies) were said to
      facilitate the developmental process, whereas the final category (negative
      experiences and influences) was said to impede this process. A grounded theory in
      which the aforementioned categories enable coaches to nurture a "generalized
      form" of mental toughness acquired during one's formative years into a
      "sport-specific form" pertinent to Australian football is presented. The
      theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - Over the past three decades, the world of both amateur and professional sports
      has expanded greatly and become more complex. In part related to these changes - 
      and relatively unknown to sports medicine practitioners - the field of sport
      psychiatry has steadily evolved and grown. This paper focuses on what these
      changes have been. A sport psychiatrist is a physician-psychiatrist who diagnoses
      and treats problems, symptoms and/or disorders associated with an athlete, with
      their family/significant others, with their team, or with their sport, including 
      spectators/fans. The primary aims of the specialty are to (i) optimize health,
      (ii) improve athletic performance, and (iii) manage psychiatric symptoms or
      disorders. The training includes medical training to provide knowledge and skills
      unique to physicians; psychiatric training to provide knowledge and skills
      inherent in that field, and training and/or experience in sport psychiatry to
      provide knowledge and skills about psychiatric aspects of sports. The sport
      psychiatrist first makes an individual, family-systems and phenomenological
      diagnosis of the clinical situation. Based on this evaluation, he sets goals for 
      not only the athlete, but also for significant others involved. He delivers
      treatment based on the psychiatric disorder or problem using a combination of
      medication, psychotherapy or self-help group interventions plus strategies
      targeted to specific sport performance issues. Evolution of the International
      Society of Sport Psychiatry as well as the field, including incorporation into
      school and professional team sports, is described along with a 'typical day' for 
      a sport psychiatrist. Case examples, a training curriculum and core literature
      are included.

TI  - The effect of a carbohydrate-caffeine sports drink on simulated golf performance.
PG  - 681-8
LID - 10.1139/H09-057 [doi]
AB  - A round of golf lasts approximately 4 h, during which time homeostasis could be
      challenged through either hypoglycemia or hypohydration. This might result in
      impaired motor skill or cognitive performance. Given the high cognitive demand of
      putting and the potential fatiguing effects from prolonged walking, the
      combination of a caffeine and carbohydrate drink could be beneficial in
      offsetting hypoglycemia and hypohydration. This study used a laboratory-simulated
      round of golf to examine the effect of an isotonic carbohydrate and caffeine
      sports drink on putting performance during a round of golf. After institutional
      ethics approval, 20 male golfers (mean +/- standard deviation: age 23 +/- 4
      years, stature 176.4 +/- 5.6 cm, mass 72.8 +/- 17.4 kg, handicap 15 +/- 4, daily 
      caffeine consumption 157.3 +/- 47.2 mg) consumed either an isotonic sports drink 
      containing caffeine (6.4 g carbohydrate and 16 mg caffeine per 100 mL) or a
      no-energy, flavour-matched placebo drink in a double-blind, randomized,
      counter-balanced crossover design . Drinks were consumed preround (5 mL.kg-1 body
      mass (BM)) and at holes 6 and 12 (2.5 mL.kg-1 BM). Participants therefore
      consumed 1.6 mg.kg-1 BM of caffeine and 0.64 g.kg-1 BM of carbohydrate throughout
      the trial. Five and 2 m putting performance were assessed at each hole.
      Self-rated mood assessments were carried out every third hole. Putting
      performance over 5 m and 2 m and self-rated scores for alertness and relaxation
      showed a main effect for drink (p < 0.05). Ratings of mental fatigue and
      tiredness significantly increased during the round (p < 0.001). In experienced
      golfers, the consumption of an isotonic carbohydrate sports drink containing
      caffeine prior to and during a round of golf improved putting performance and
      increased feelings of alertness.

TI  - Can sports events affect suicidal behavior? A review of the literature and
      implications for prevention.
PG  - 144-52
LID - 10.1027/0227-5910.30.3.144 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Engagement in sports and physical activity, either actively as an
      athlete or in a passive way as a spectator, impacts interpersonal behavior and
      physical and mental health. AIMS: The study reviews literature on the
      relationship between sports spectatorship and suicidal behavior to ascertain
      whether sports spectatorship has an impact on suicidal behavior, either
      increasing the risk or being a protective factor. METHODS: The literature was
      searched via PubMed/MEDLINE and PsycINFO. Nine studies published between 1986 and
      2006 were identified. RESULTS: The reviewed studies focused on the impact of
      sports events on the societal level, and analyzed data regarding national or
      local suicide rates. Their results indicate that sports events can have an impact
      on suicide mortality and morbidity, but this relationship seems to be mediated by
      age, gender, marital status, and alcohol consumption, as well as the process and 
      outcome of the game (e.g., victory vs. defeat of the favored team). CONCLUSIONS: 
      There is some evidence that sports events can reduce the rates of suicide on the 
      societal level; however, there is a lack of studies exploring how sports
      spectatorship might influence levels of suicide risk in individuals and how
      mediating variables might operate on the individual level.

PG  - 1335-46
LID - 10.1080/02640410903277427 [doi]
AB  - Ubiquitous (pervasive) computing is a term for a synergetic use of sensing,
      communication and computing. Pervasive use of computing has seen a rapid increase
      in the current decade. This development has propagated in applied sport science
      and everyday life. The work presents a survey of recent developments in sport and
      leisure with emphasis on technology and computational techniques. A detailed
      analysis on new technological developments is performed. Sensors for position and
      motion detection, and such for equipment and physiological monitoring are
      discussed. Aspects of novel trends in communication technologies and data
      processing are outlined. Computational advancements have started a new trend -
      development of smart and intelligent systems for a wide range of applications -
      from model-based posture recognition to context awareness algorithms for
      nutrition monitoring. Examples particular to coaching and training are discussed.
      Selected tools for monitoring rules' compliance and automatic decision-making are
      outlined. Finally, applications in leisure and entertainment are presented, from 
      systems supporting physical activity to systems providing motivation. It is
      concluded that the emphasis in future will shift from technologies to intelligent
      systems that allow for enhanced social interaction as efforts need to be made to 
      improve user-friendliness and standardisation of measurement and transmission
      protocols.

AB  - Spectators of the Olympic Games can enjoy a wide variety of sports, including
      strength, team, timed, endurance, and artistic sports. In the Olympic program,
      there are two synchronized events: synchronized diving and synchronized swimming.
      The precision of the synchronization of the athlete's movements and skills is an 
      added feature of entertainment. Synchronized athletes have additional training
      requirements to perfect the synchronization of their skills. The physical demands
      on the athlete from the repetition of training required for the perfection of
      synchronization result in injuries unique to these sports. Although both
      traumatic and overuse injuries occur, overuse injuries are more common. As these 
      disciplines are artistic, judged sports, these athletes also are susceptible to
      eating disorders and the female athlete triad. This article reviews the training 
      regimen of these athletes and outlines the injuries and health concerns that are 
      common in the synchronized sports.

      strategies is necessary. It is equally important to explore involvement of other 
      resources in society, such as sports associations. This study was designed to
      investigate the possibility of reducing the degree of obesity in obese children
      by focusing on physical activity as an intervention. METHODS: Seventy-six
      children (40 boys) aged 8-12 years (mean age 10.5 years, mean body mass index
      (BMI) 28.9, standard deviation (SD) 3.0; mean BMI z-score 3.24, SD 0.49) were
      invited to participate in a one-week sports camp and six-month support system.
      After the camp a sports coach from a local sports club supported the child during
      participation in a chosen sport for six months. Weight, height, body composition 
      (using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry and magnetic resonance imaging), and
      lifestyle (using a questionnaire) were measured at baseline and after 12 months. 
      Data were pooled from two camps, one with a self-selected control group and one
      randomized controlled trial. RESULTS: Twelve months after the camp the
      intervention group had a significant decrease in BMI z-score (baseline BMI
      z-score 3.22; follow up 3.10, p = 0.023). The control group also reduced their
      BMI z-score (baseline BMI z-score 3.27; follow up 3.18, p = 0.022). No
      differences were found in baseline values, follow-up values, or changes in BMI
      z-score between groups, nor between boys and girls. CONCLUSIONS: The focus on
      physical activity as an intervention had no effect on degree of obesity when
      compared with a waiting list control group.

TI  - Recovery from injury in sport: considerations in the transition from medical care
      to performance care.
PG  - 392-5
AB  - Return from athletic injury can be a lengthy and difficult process. The injured
      athlete commonly receives care from several providers during rehabilitation. As
      their condition improves, injured athletes resume strength and conditioning
      programs and sport-specific activities in preparation for return to play. Until
      full medical clearance is provided to return to sport and the athlete is
      psychologically ready to return to play, the injured athlete remains a patient
      regardless of who is developing and supervising each component of the recovery
      process. An understanding of and commitment to the plan of care for each athlete,
      as well as communication among health care providers, strength and conditioning
      specialists, coaches, and the athletes, are essential to the safest and most
      efficient recovery from injury.

PG  - 361-9
AB  - CONTEXT: The vast differences between individual athletes makes identifying and
      evaluating sports-related concussion one of the most complex and perplexing
      injuries faced by medical personnel. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: This review summarizes
      the existing literature supporting the use of a multifaceted approach to
      concussion evaluation on the sideline of the athletic field. Information was
      drawn from a PubMed search (MEDLINE) for the terms sport concussion for the most 
      recent and relevant literature. CONCLUSIONS: By using a standardized clinical
      examination that is supported by objective measures of concussion-related
      symptoms, mental status, and postural control, the medical professional becomes
      well equipped to make an informed diagnosis.

PG  - 52-62
LID - 10.1016/j.brainres.2009.08.014 [doi]
AB  - Numerous studies provide evidence that motor skill acquisition is associated with
      dynamic changes in cortical and subcortical regions. Athletes are a professional 
      population who are engaged in extensive motor training for long periods. However,
      the neural substrates of extreme level motor performance have not been clarified.
      We used kinesthetic imagery task to induce the mental representation of sport
      expert's extraordinary performance in view of the shared substrates of executing 
      movement and motor imagery. For the first time, we compared, through functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the pattern of cerebral activations in 12
      professional divers and 12 normal people without extensive training, during
      imagery of professional skills and imagery of simple motor skills. The sport
      experts showed significant activation in the parahippocampus during imagery of
      professional skills relative to the novices, which might reflect the
      representation adapted to experience-related motor tasks. No significant
      difference was found between experts and novices when they imagined simple motor 
      skills. These results indicated the experts might utilize their kinesthetic
      imagery more efficiently than novices, but only for the activity in which they
      had expertise. The sport experts also demonstrated more focused activation
      patterns in prefrontal areas in both of imagery tasks, which may be relevant to
      higher order of motor control during motor imagery. Moreover, this study
      suggested that the brains of sport experts could be regarded as the ideal
      subjects to explore the relationship between cerebral plasticity and learning of 
      complex motor skills.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine relationships among coaching staff
      diversity, perceptions of diversity, value congruence, and life satisfaction.
      Data were collected from 71 coaching staffs (N=196 coaches). Observed path
      analysis was used to examine the study predictions. Results indicate that actual 
      staff diversity was positively related to perceptions of such heterogeneity,
      which were negatively related to value congruence among the coaches. Finally,
      value congruence was positively associated with life satisfaction of members of
      the coaching staff Results are discussed in terms of research and practical
      implications.

TI  - The relation between athletic sports and prevalence of amenorrhea and
      oligomenorrhea in Iranian female athletes.
PG  - 16
LID - 10.1186/1758-2555-1-16 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 1992, the concept of female athlete triad was introduced to
      describe the interrelated problems of amenorrhea, eating disorders and
      osteoporosis seen in female athletes. To gain a clearer picture of
      amenorrhea/oligomenorrhea in Iran, one of the main components of the female
      athlete triad, we therefore established this study on the prevalence of
      amenorrhea/oligomenorrhea in elite Iranian female athletes, also evaluating the
      risk factors of these disorders in the same population. METHODS: This study
      performed as a cross-sectional study. All elite Iranian female athletes of 34
      sports federation, including female athletes in national teams and medalists of
      Tehran were invited to participate. A total of 788 (95% response rate) returned
      the questionnaires and were examined. Younger athletes under the age of menarche 
      were excluded. Each athlete completed a self-administered questionnaire, which
      covered the following questions about participant's demographic information,
      athletic history, history of injuries and menstrual pattern. In order to diagnose
      the causes of amenorrhea/Oligomenorrhea including polycystic ovary
      syndrome(PCOS), participants with amenorrhea/Oligomenorrhea underwent further
      investigation. They were evaluated by following Para clinic investigation, and an
      ultrasonographic study of ovary. RESULTS: The age ranged from 13-37 (mean = 21.1,
      SD = 4.5). Seventy one (9.0%) individuals had amenorrhea/oligomenorrhea, among
      those, 11 (15.5%) had PCOS.There was also a positive association between
      amenorrhea/oligomenorrhea and the following: age under 20 OR; 2.67, 95%CI(1.47 - 
      4.85), weight class sports OR; 2.09, 95%CI(1.15 - 3.82), endurance sports OR;
      2.89, 95%CI(1.22 - 6.84), late onset of menarche OR; 3.32 95%CI(1.04-10.51), and 
      use of oral contraceptive pills OR; 6.17, 95%CI(3.00 - 12.69). Intensity of
      training sport or BMI were not risk factors. CONCLUSION: These findings support
      the previous findings in the literature that the prevalence of
      amenorrhea/oligomenorrhea is high in athletes. Furthermore, we provided the first
      report on the prevalence of PCOS in female athletes with
      amenorrhea/oligomenorrhea. Athletes would be greatly benefited by greater general
      awareness about the complications of amenorrhea/oligomenorrhea.To increase
      awareness of exercise-associated menstrual cycle irregularities, it is necessary 
      to design complete and comprehensive education programs for female athletes,
      their parents, their coaches, and the relevant authorities.

PG  - 306-18
LID - 10.1080/10894160902876804 [doi]
AB  - This article utilizes cultural studies praxis, queer theory, and feminist
      poststructuralism to explore the ways in which eight collegiate-level coaches who
      self-identify with non-normative sexualities transgress heteronormative
      boundaries by being "out" or visible in sporting spaces. Data were collected
      through semi-structured qualitative interviews and analyzed within a
      queer-feminist hybrid framework (Sykes, 1998). I found that compulsory
      heterosexuality continually worked to silence female coaches with non-normative
      sexualities despite their efforts to change heterosexist sport cultures. Many of 
      these women engaged in necessary practical strategies for historically silenced
      groups (Sedgewick, 1990) to create change, such as changing language in athletic 
      department policy, and using a politics of difference to challenge the status quo
      on several fronts (e.g., gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality). However, in spite
      of conscientious efforts to do otherwise, poststructuralist and queer
      deconstructions of the transcripts illustrated how forced norms and discursive
      practices inherent in sport regulated both silence and speech for many of the
      interviewees.

AB  - Public-private partnerships allow communities and corporate entities to pool
      resources to address a mission of relevance to their common constituency or
      consumer base. Collaborations between public health and professional sports may
      present unique opportunities to improve health outcomes related to physical
      activity since athletes are fitness icons, both for adults and children. There
      are many "win-win" opportunities, as sports venues regularly host huge numbers of
      spectators, offering food and entertainment, providing hours of exposure, and
      introducing new ideas for engaging fans in order to remain a competitive draw. In
      2008, the San Diego Padres embarked on a communitywide fitness initiative,
      FriarFit, including incorporating 10-minute Instant Recess breaks during their
      Sunday homestand pre-game shows. Many lessons have been learned that may be
      useful to others mounting such initiatives, such as: there is more at stake in
      cost-benefit and risk-benefit assessment for sports executives, requiring greater
      caution and circumspection than is typical for public health projects; the core
      business of the corporate entity must be accommodated without undermining the
      health objectives; and health aims must be addressed in a way that is financially
      viable and delivers tangible value for profit-making concerns, in terms of
      marketing, revenues or brand enhancement.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the joint effects of movie smoking exposure and team sports
      participation on established smoking. DESIGN: Longitudinal study. SETTING:
      School- and telephone-based surveys in New Hampshire and Vermont between
      September 1999 through November 1999 and February 2006 through February 2007.
      PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2048 youths aged 16 to 21 years at follow-up. Main
      Exposures Baseline movie smoking exposure categorized in quartiles assessed when 
      respondents were aged 9 to 14 years and team sports participation assessed when
      respondents were aged 16 to 21 years. Main Outcome Measure Established smoking
      (having smoked > or =100 cigarettes in one's lifetime) at follow-up. RESULTS: At 
      follow-up, 353 respondents (17.2%) were established smokers. Exposure to the
      highest quartile of movie smoking compared with the lowest increased the
      likelihood of established smoking (odds ratio = 1.63; 95% confidence interval,
      1.03-2.57), and team sports nonparticipants compared with participants were twice
      as likely to be established smokers (odds ratio = 2.01; 95% confidence interval, 
      1.47-2.74). The joint effects of movie smoking exposure and team sports
      participation revealed that at each quartile of movie smoking exposure, the odds 
      of established smoking were greater for team sports nonparticipants than for
      participants. We saw a dose-response relationship of movie smoking exposure for
      established smoking only among team sports participants. CONCLUSIONS: Team sports
      participation clearly plays a protective role against established smoking, even
      in the face of exposure to movie smoking. However, movie smoking exposure
      increases the risk of established smoking among both team sports participants and
      nonparticipants. Parents, teachers, coaches, and clinicians should be aware that 
      encouraging team sports participation in tandem with minimizing early exposure to
      movie smoking may offer the greatest likelihood of preventing youth smoking.

TI  - Shoulder muscle recruitment patterns and related biomechanics during upper
      extremity sports.
PG  - 569-90

AB  - Understanding when and how much shoulder muscles are active during upper
      extremity sports is helpful to physicians, therapists, trainers and coaches in
      providing appropriate treatment, training and rehabilitation protocols to these
      athletes. This review focuses on shoulder muscle activity (rotator cuff,
      deltoids, pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, triceps and biceps brachii, and
      scapular muscles) during the baseball pitch, the American football throw, the
      windmill softball pitch, the volleyball serve and spike, the tennis serve and
      volley, baseball hitting, and the golf swing. Because shoulder electromyography
      (EMG) data are far more extensive for overhead throwing activities compared with 
      non-throwing upper extremity sports, much of this review focuses on shoulder EMG 
      during the overhead throwing motion. Throughout this review shoulder kinematic
      and kinetic data (when available) are integrated with shoulder EMG data to help
      better understand why certain muscles are active during different phases of an
      activity, what type of muscle action (eccentric or concentric) occurs, and to
      provide insight into the shoulder injury mechanism. Kinematic, kinetic and EMG
      data have been reported extensively during overhead throwing, such as baseball
      pitching and football passing. Because shoulder forces, torques and muscle
      activity are generally greatest during the arm cocking and arm deceleration
      phases of overhead throwing, it is believed that most shoulder injuries occur
      during these phases. During overhead throwing, high rotator cuff muscle activity 
      is generated to help resist the high shoulder distractive forces approximately
      80-120% bodyweight during the arm cocking and deceleration phases. During arm
      cocking, peak rotator cuff activity is 49-99% of a maximum voluntary isometric
      contraction (MVIC) in baseball pitching and 41-67% MVIC in football throwing.
      During arm deceleration, peak rotator cuff activity is 37-84% MVIC in baseball
      pitching and 86-95% MVIC in football throwing. Peak rotator cuff activity is also
      high is the windmill softball pitch (75-93% MVIC), the volleyball serve and spike
      (54-71% MVIC), the tennis serve and volley (40-113% MVIC), baseball hitting
      (28-39% MVIC), and the golf swing (28-68% MVIC). Peak scapular muscle activity is
      also high during the arm cocking and arm deceleration phases of baseball
      pitching, with peak serratus anterior activity 69-106% MVIC, peak upper, middle
      and lower trapezius activity 51-78% MVIC, peak rhomboids activity 41-45% MVIC,
      and peak levator scapulae activity 33-72% MVIC. Moreover, peak serratus anterior 
      activity was approximately 60% MVIC during the windmill softball pitch,
      approximately 75% MVIC during the tennis serve and forehand and backhand volley, 
      approximately 30-40% MVIC during baseball hitting, and approximately 70% MVIC
      during the golf swing. In addition, during the golf swing, peak upper, middle and
      lower trapezius activity was 42-52% MVIC, peak rhomboids activity was
      approximately 60% MVIC, and peak levator scapulae activity was approximately 60% 
      MVIC.

      strength and conditioning coaches.
PG  - 1084-90
LID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e318199d8c4 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine whether male and female Division I team 
      sport athletes prefer same-sex or opposite-sex strength and conditioning coaches.
      Participants included 476 (male = 275, female = 201) National Collegiate Athletic
      Association Division I collegiate football, soccer, and volleyball athletes; the 
      men were from football programs and the women were from soccer and volleyball
      programs. The Attitudes of Athletes toward Male versus Female Coaches
      Questionnaire was used to assess the attitudes and feelings of male and female
      athletes toward the gender of their strength coach (29). The results of a 2 x 2
      multivariate analysis of variance (athlete gender x coach gender) revealed that
      the male athletes (all football players) were less comfortable with a female
      strength coach in all regards and preferred to have a male strength coach (p <
      0.05). Female athletes did not have a gender preference, nor did they have any
      negative attitudes toward a strength coach. The women would be productive
      training with any qualified strength coach, whereas the men would prefer working 
      with a male strength coach no matter how qualified the female coach might be. As 
      a result of this study, one suggestion is for male athletes to be exposed to
      female strength coaches much earlier in their sport experience. This might help
      reduce gender bias later in their athletic careers.

TI  - Coach autonomy support and quality of sport engagement in young soccer players.
PG  - 138-48
AB  - Based on the self-determination theory (Ryan & Deci, 2000), this study tested a
      model of the assumed sequential relationships between perceived autonomy support,
      psychological need satisfaction, self-determined motivation, and
      enjoyment/boredom. The hypothesized mediational roles of psychological need
      satisfaction and self-determined motivation were also studied. In a sample of 370
      young male soccer players, path analysis results offered support for the proposed
      model. Total mediation was supported in the case of the psychological need
      satisfaction in the relationship between autonomy support and self-determined
      motivation, and partial mediation for self-determined motivation in the links
      between psychological need satisfaction and enjoyment (positive) and boredom
      (negative). Implications of autonomy-supportive behaviors provided by coaches for
      the quality of sport involvement among young athletes are discussed.

TI  - Sport concussion assessment tool: baseline values for varsity collision sport
      athletes.
PG  - 730-4
LID - 10.1136/bjsm.2009.059832 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine baseline symptom and neurocognitive norms for
      non-concussed and previously concussed varsity athletes using the sport
      concussion assessment tool (SCAT). STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive cohort study.
      SETTING: University of Calgary. SUBJECTS: 260 male and female university
      football, ice hockey and wrestling athletes over three seasons (2005-7). METHODS:
      A baseline SCAT was completed during preseason medical evaluation. Subjects were 
      grouped as follows: all participants, men, women, never concussed (NC) and
      previously concussed (PC). MAIN RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 20.5
      years (range 17-32). In total, 41.2% of all athletes had a total post-concussion 
      symptom scale (PCSS) score of 0. The mean baseline PCSS scores were as follows:
      all participants 4.29; men 3.52; women 6.39; NC 3.75 and PC 5.25. The five most
      frequently reported symptoms for all athletes were fatigue/low energy (37% of
      subjects), drowsiness (23%), neck pain (20%), difficulty concentrating (18%) and 
      difficulty remembering (18%). The median immediate recall score was 5/5 for all
      groups. Women scored a median of 5/5 on delayed recall, whereas all remaining
      groups scored a median of 4/5. Months in reverse order were successfully
      completed by 91.6% of subjects. All participants, women and PC scored a median of
      6 on reverse digits, whereas men and NC scored a median of 5. CONCLUSIONS: The
      mean SCAT baseline PCSS score was approximately 5, although just under half of
      the athletes scored 0. Female athletes scored better on tests of neurocognitive
      function. PC athletes scored better than NC athletes on all neurocognitive tests 
      except delayed five-word recall.

TI  - Promoting a skills-based agenda in Olympic sports: the role of skill-acquisition 
      specialists.
PG  - 1381-92
LID - 10.1080/02640410902874737 [doi]
AB  - We highlight the importance of promoting a skills-based agenda in the development
      and preparation of Olympic athletes. The role that specialists with a background 
      in skill acquisition can play is illustrated and the need to move towards a
      culture where evidence-based practice permeates all aspects of this process
      reiterated. We provide examples from contemporary research to illustrate how
      skill-acquisition theory and practice can help inform and guide practitioners,
      coaches, and administrators in their quest to develop Olympic athletes. Although 
      the acquisition and refinement of skills are essential to performance in most
      Olympic sports, paradoxically the area of skill acquisition has not impacted in a
      concerted and meaningful way on this agenda. Skill-acquisition specialists need
      to be more proactive in forging links with elite sport, whereas practitioners,
      coaches, and administrators need to appreciate the important role that sports
      scientists with a background in this area can play in helping to develop future
      generations of podium athletes.

AB  - We examined the influence of order effects on assessments of sporting ability.
      Club-standard ultimate frisbee players (n = 240) viewed footage of a target
      player performing a series of ultimate frisbee skills. Participants viewed either
      a declining (successful to unsuccessful) pattern of performance or an ascending
      (unsuccessful to successful) pattern. Ratings were made on three descriptors of
      ultimate frisbee ability. One group of participants made ratings at the end of
      the sequence of clips, one group updated their ratings after each clip in a
      step-by-step manner, and one group used an extended step-by-step processing
      strategy. Finally, a fourth group made end-of-sequence ratings, but a delay
      condition was used to control for the time taken to make step-by-step ratings.
      Analyses of covariance (order vs. judgement condition) were conducted on the
      ratings. Results revealed primacy effects for the ratings of the target player in
      the end-of-sequence and delay conditions, and in the first step-by-step
      condition, but no order effects in the second step-by-step condition. Findings
      indicate order effects can be reduced by using a more thorough step-by-step
      processing strategy.

      Sport Discus databases were reviewed. 52 journal articles, 20 websites and 2
      books were reviewed. RESULTS: The methods in which individuals experience optimal
      learning varies and should be considered when developing effective concussion
      education strategies. Physician knowledge and performance are impacted by
      education outreach, interaction and reminder messages. Educational strategies
      associated with optimal learning for physio and athletic therapists include
      problem and evidence-based practice, socialisation and peer-assisted learning.
      From a coaching perspective, research supports the reflective process as a
      learning modality. Student athletes have strengths and weaknesses in different
      areas and so perform differently on activities requiring distinct strategies.
      Knowing the impact of sport concussion resources on knowledge enhancement and
      modifying attitudes and behaviours toward concussion requires evaluation
      strategies. Review of concussion resources using the perspective of knowledge
      transfer and methods for improvement is discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge
      transfer is a relatively new concept in sports medicine and its influence on
      enhancing concussion education is not well known. The needs and optimal learning 
      styles of target audiences coupled with evaluation need to be a piece of the
      overall concussion education puzzle to effectively impact knowledge of and
      attitudes and behaviours towards sport concussion.

TI  - Maximal anaerobic power test in athletes of different sport disciplines.
PG  - 751-5
LID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181a07a9a [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the values of anaerobic energetic
      capacity variables in athletes engaged in different sport disciplines and to
      compare them in relation to specific demands of each sport. Wingate anaerobic
      tests were conducted on 145 elite athletes (14 boxers, 17 wrestlers, 27 hockey
      players, 23 volleyball players, 20 handball players, 25 basketball players, and
      19 soccer players). Three variables were measured as markers of anaerobic
      capacity: peak power, mean power, and explosive power. The highest values of peak
      power were measured in volleyball 11.71 +/- 1.56 W.kg and basketball players
      10.69 +/- 1.67 W.kg, and the difference was significant compared with the other
      athletes (p <or= 0.05). The lowest value of peak power (8.58 +/- 1.56 W.kg) was
      registered in handball players. The mean power variable showed a similar
      distribution as peak power among groups. The highest values of explosive power
      were also registered in volleyball 1.75 +/- 0.33 W.s.kg and basketball players
      1.64 +/- 0.35 W.s.kg, but there was no significant difference in values between
      volleyball players and wrestlers, between boxers and wrestlers, between boxers
      and basketball players, and between volleyball and hockey players (p > 0.05). The
      measured results show the influence of anaerobic capacity in different sports and
      the referral values of these variables for the elite male athletes. Explosive
      power presented a new dimension of anaerobic power, i.e., how fast maximal energy
      for power development can be obtained, and its values are high in all sports
      activities that demand explosiveness and fast maximal energy production. Coaches 
      or other experts in the field could, in the future, find useful to follow and
      improve, through training process, one of the variables that is most informative 
      for that sport.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Considering the search for adventure activities as a form of improving
      life quality, the present paper aimed at analyzing the perception of some
      dimensions of that category among hang-gliding apprentices. METHODS: A
      questionnaire was applied to 30 brasilians hang-gliding and paragliding
      apprentices in order to identify aspects such as, physical activity, preventive
      behavior, nutrition, stress control and social relationships. RESULTS: Comparing 
      results with the ones found in other adventure sports, it was observed that
      flyers adopt a competitive and risky behavior, not showing good results in
      relation to affectionate relationships and physical exercises. On the other hand,
      all of them are considered as wealthy and more used to dealing with stress. Even 
      not possessing good physical conditioning, individuals practice flight just due
      to their technical knowledge and the dominium of technology Thus, apprentices use
      those sport tensions as a form of training the stress control in risky
      situations. CONCLUSIONS: Regarding mental health, activities of active leisure
      are highly recommended as an escape valve to stress. The group studied showed
      that besides increasing the tolerance to stress, generated by risky situations,
      individuals went beyond, once it was observed that the risks of such sport have
      turned the individuals into more and more insensitive to the professional life
      pressure.

TI  - Job stressors and the pursuit of sport activities: a day-level perspective.
PG  - 165-81
LID - 10.1037/a0014953 [doi]
AB  - This article addresses the relation between day-specific experiences of job
      stressors and the pursuit of off-job activities. Following the limited-resources 
      model of self-regulation, the authors proposed that job stressors and long
      working hours are negatively related to pursuit of sport activities after work
      because, after stressful days, employees have no resources left for initiating
      and persisting in effortful behaviors such as sport. Routines for off-job
      activities were hypothesized to be positively related to the pursuit of sport
      activities after work. Seventy-eight police employees completed a daily survey
      over 5 working days and indicated that they perceive sport to be highly useful
      for recovery. Random coefficient modeling showed that job stressors (particularly
      situational constraints) encountered on a specific day were negatively related to
      self-regulatory resources and to the amount of time spent on sport activities
      after work, whereas the relation with low-effort activities was positive. Thus,
      after a stressful day when an effective recovery activity such as sport is highly
      needed, persons tend to engage less in such an activity.

LID - 10.1080/10615800802629922 [doi]
AB  - The effects of perceived stress (PS) on the relationship between adaptive and
      maladaptive forms of perfectionism and burnout were examined. Smith's
      (1986)stress appraisal model and Kelley, Eklund, and Ritter-Taylor's (1999) model
      of coach burnout were used to test two models of burnout in a sample of college
      coaches (N=177). The results indicated that there is an indirect effect of
      self-evaluative perfectionism (i.e., maladaptive form of perfectionism) on
      burnout through PS as well as a significant direct link to burnout, accounting
      for 56% of its variance. In contrast, conscientious perfectionism (CP) (i.e.,
      adaptive perfectionism) did not directly impact burnout, nor was there an
      indirect effect through PS. Based on Lazarus's (1999) ideas about stress
      appraisal, the results suggested that maladaptive forms of perfectionism resulted
      in more threatening perceptions of stress, thus, potentially leading to the
      experience of burnout. However, adaptive forms of perfectionism did not seem to
      result in increased appraisals of stress or result in burnout. The results did
      indicate a significant correlation between the two forms of perfectionism, which 
      may explain why CP did not significantly impact PS or burnout.

TI  - Use of mouthguard rates among university athletes during sport activities in
      Erzurum, Turkey.
PG  - 318-22
LID - 10.1111/j.1600-9657.2009.00769.x [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the attitudes of mouthguard users in
      Erzurum, Turkey. The participants' appreciation in the use of protective devices,
      such as mouthguards, during sport activities was also evaluated. In this study, a
      10-item questionnaire was distributed to 50 coaches and a 10-item questionnaire
      was distributed to 768 university athletes of three different sport modalities
      (basketball, soccer and volleyball) in the Ataturk University Sport Competitions.
      The Sport Competitions are composed of 20 faculty, except the faculty of
      dentistry. The result of the coaches' questionnaires indicated that none of the
      athletes used mouthguards while participating in sports. Of the coaches, 64% had 
      seen orofacial trauma in their athletes during sport activities and 76% believed 
      that mouthguards prevented oral injuries. Of the coaches, 76% reported that
      university athletes should use mouthguards in sport activities. The result of the
      university athletes' questionnaires revealed that the mouthguard utilization rate
      was 0%. Of all players, 78.1% were males (age 17-29) and 21.9% were females (age 
      18-23). Of all players, 7.31% had suffered from one or more type of oral injury
      while not wearing mouthguards. The results indicate that in Turkey, the use of
      mouthguards is rare in sports. It should be a combined duty of dentists, sports
      physicians, and coaches to encourage the use of mouthguards during training and
      sport activities. Doctors and dentists need to recommend a more intensive
      education of students in sports medicine and sports dentistry.

TI  - Development and preliminary validation of the Injury-Psychological Readiness to
      Return to Sport (I-PRRS) scale.
PG  - 185-9
LID - 10.4085/1062-6050-44.2.185 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Only a few scales measure confidence within sport; however, these scales
      are insufficient to measure confidence after athletic injuries. Therefore, better
      measures are needed to determine the psychological readiness of injured athletes 
      to return to sport participation. OBJECTIVE: To develop a scale that measures the
      psychological readiness of injured athletes to return to sport participation and 
      to provide preliminary evidence of reliability and validity for the scale.
      DESIGN: The Delphi method was used to develop the Injury-Psychological Readiness 
      to Return to Sport scale (I-PRRS). Two 1-way analyses of variance with repeated
      measures and 6 Pearson product moment correlations were computed to help validate
      the scale. SETTING: Athletic training clinics at 3 National Collegiate Athletic
      Association (NCAA) schools. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Four certified
      athletic trainers (ATs) and professors of Commission on Accreditation of Athletic
      Training Education-accredited athletic training programs and 3 NCAA Division III 
      coaches made up a panel of experts that participated in the Delphi portion of the
      study to develop the I-PRRS. In the second part of the study, 22 injured
      athletes, who missed a minimum of 1 week of practice, from 3 NCAA schools in
      Divisions II and III were surveyed along with their respective ATs. The injured
      athletes and ATs participated in the validation of the I-PRRS. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURE(S): The injured athlete completed the Profile of Mood States (POMS) short
      form and the I-PRRS shortly after injury, before returning to the first practice,
      before returning to competition, and immediately after competition. The
      respective AT completed the I-PRRS before and after competition. The I-PRRS is a 
      6-item scale that measures the psychological readiness of injured athletes to
      return to sport, and the POMS short form is a 30-item scale that measures mood
      states. I added the negative moods of the POMS and subtracted the positive moods 
      of the POMS to calculate a Total Mood Disturbance (TMD) score. RESULTS: The
      I-PRRS scores were negatively correlated with the TMD scores of the POMS short
      form at all 4 time intervals, showing concurrent validity. The I-PRRS scores were
      lowest after injury, increased before practice, increased again before
      competition, and had no change after competition. The I-PRRS as completed by the 
      athlete and respective AT was positively correlated both before and after
      practice, demonstrating external validity. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary evidence for 
      reliability and validity of the I-PRRS was demonstrated. The I-PRRS can be a
      beneficial tool for ATs to assess an athlete's psychological readiness to return 
      to sport participation after injury.

TI  - The effects of autonomy-supportive coaching, need satisfaction, and
      self-perceptions on initiative and identity in youth swimmers.
PG  - 320-8
LID - 10.1037/a0014027 [doi]
AB  - This study tested a sequential process model linking youth sport coaching
      climates (perceived coach behaviors and perceived need satisfaction) to youth
      self-perceptions (perceived competence and global self-esteem) and youth
      development outcomes (initiative, identity reflection, identity exploration). A
      sample of 119 youth between the ages of 10 and 18 who participated in a
      community-directed summer swim league completed questionnaires over the course of
      the 7-week season. Results indicated that coaches' autonomy support, particularly
      via process-focused praise, predicted youth competence need satisfaction and
      relatedness need satisfaction in the coaching relationship. Youth competence need
      satisfaction predicted self-esteem indirectly via perceived competence. Finally, 
      self-esteem predicted identity reflection, and perceived competence predicted
      both identity reflection and initiative. Effects of age, sex, and perceptions of 
      direct contact with the coach were not significant. Findings suggest that the
      quality of the coaching climate is an important predictor of the developmental
      benefits of sport participation and that one pathway by which the coaching
      climate has its effect on initiative and identity reflection is through
      developing youth self-perceptions.

TI  - The sport experience of athletes with intellectual disabilities: a national
      survey of special olympics athletes and their families.
PG  - 68-85
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the sport experience for athletes with
      intellectual disabilities (ID) who participate in Special Olympics (SO). This
      study included a nationally representative sample of 1,307 families and 579
      athletes in the U.S., focusing on sport involvement over the lifespan and motives
      for participating and for leaving SO. Athletes with ID are similar to athletes
      without disabilities in that sport is a significant life experience. They
      participate in sport for fun (54%) and social interaction (21%). Like athletes
      without disabilities, SO athletes leave sport because of changes in interest
      (38%) but also because of program availability (33%). These findings suggest that
      we continue to document the involvement of people with ID in sports and work to
      expand the sport opportunities available.

TI  - Does a free-of-charge distribution of boil-and-bite mouthguards to young adult
      amateur sportsmen affect oral and facial trauma?
PG  - 69-72
LID - 10.1111/j.1600-9657.2008.00708.x [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the compliance
      effectiveness of free-of-charge distribution of boil-and-bite mouthguards to
      amateur sportsmen who exercise and play without a formal team, a coach, or
      regulations. Several infantry units in the Israel Defense Forces distributed
      maxillary boil-and-bite mouthguards to their recruits. Target companies from
      these battalions and from similar battalions (comparison group--mouthguards not
      supplied), were selected. Soldiers were interviewed using a structured
      questionnaire. Of the 630 male participants, 272 received a mouthguard and 358
      served as the comparison group. No differences were found between groups
      regarding demographic parameters or overall trauma cases. When compliance to a
      free-of-charge distributed boil-and-bite mouthguard was assessed, 93 (34.2%)
      participants reported using the mouthguard during sport activities. Compliance
      was high for martial arts, but low for other sports. Although the number of
      self-reported sport-related oral/dental trauma cases was similar between
      mouthguard users and non-users, the users group showed less severe injuries.
      However, free distribution to young amateur sportsmen does not affect oral and
      dental trauma unless accompanied by education and motivation.

TI  - A sports setting matrix for understanding the implementation context for
      community sport.
PG  - 973-8
LID - 10.1136/bjsm.2008.056069 [doi]
AB  - There has been increasing recognition of the need for effectiveness research
      within the real-world intervention context of community sport. This is important 
      because, even if interventions have been shown to be efficacious in controlled
      trials, if they are not also widely adopted and sustained, then it is unlikely
      that they will have a public health impact. There is very little information
      about how to best conduct such studies, but application of health promotion
      frameworks, such as the RE-AIM framework, to evaluate the public health impact of
      interventions could potentially help to understand the implementation context.
      Care needs to be taken when directly applying the RE-AIM framework, however,
      because the definitions for each of its dimensions will depend on the level/s the
      intervention is targeted at. This paper provides a novel extension to the RE-AIM 
      framework (the RE-AIM Sports Setting Matrix (RE-AIM SSM)), which accounts for the
      fact that many sports injury interventions need to be targeted at multiple levels
      of sports delivery. Accordingly, the RE-AIM components also need to be measured
      across all tiers of possible influence on the rate of uptake and effectiveness.
      Specific examples are given for coachdelivered exercise training interventions.
      The RE-AIM SSM is specific to the community sports setting implementation context
      and could be used to guide the delivery of future sports safety, and other health
      promotion, interventions in this area.

TI  - Sports injuries to high school athletes with disabilities.
PG  - 690-6
LID - 10.1542/peds.2008-0603 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Physical activity in sports comes with an inherent risk for injury.
      For children with disabilities, their injury risk may be complicated by
      preexisting disability. However, very little research exists on sports injuries
      to young athletes with disabilities. To best manage potential injuries to
      children with disabilities, data on sports injury patterns are needed. The
      purpose of this study was to measure the frequency of and risk factors for injury
      to high school athletes with disabilities. METHODS: A total of 210 athletes from 
      8 special education high schools that are part of an interscholastic sports
      league participated in the study. Seven of the 8 schools were followed for 1
      season each of basketball, softball, soccer, and field hockey, and 1 school
      enrolled only during field hockey. Data were collected from coaches on daily
      exposure sessions (game, practice, and conditioning, as well as length of
      session), athlete characteristics (disability, gender, age, seizure history, and 
      behavioral problems), and nature of injuries resulting in any type of medical
      treatment. RESULTS: Thirty-eight injuries were reported among 512 special
      athletes for a rate of 2.0 per 1000 athlete exposures. Soccer (3.7 per 1000) had 
      the highest rate of injury. More than half of the injuries were abrasions and
      contusions. Those at highest risk for injury were athletes with autism, athletes 
      with histories of seizures, and starters. Athletes with autism had approximately 
      5 times the injury rate of athletes with mental disabilities. Athletes with
      seizures had >2.5 times the rate of injury reported among those with no seizure
      history. CONCLUSIONS: This adapted sports program is a reasonably safe activity
      for children with disabilities. Nonetheless, findings have important implications
      for prevention. The preparticipation medical examination may be an excellent
      opportunity to create special guidelines, particularly for athletes with autism
      and seizure history.

TI  - Sport psychology education: a preliminary survey on chartered physiotherapists'
      preferred methods of training delivery.
PG  - 399-412
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To gain an insight to the existing suggestions and recommendations on 
      chartered physiotherapists' preferred methods of delivery for further training in
      sport psychology. PARTICIPANTS: 22 delegates (14 women, 8 men) from the 2006
      Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Sports Medicine/International
      Federation of Sports Physiotherapy annual conference (response rate 53.7%).
      MEASUREMENTS: A questionnaire survey for best method of sport psychology delivery
      was developed. RESULTS: The most suitable methods for sport-psychology-training
      delivery were workshops, seminars, mentoring, and coaching. Intense training days
      and weekends were considered most appropriate. The vast majority were willing to 
      travel over 50 miles to receive training, and they indicated that the most
      suitable organizations to arrange training would be professional bodies and
      associations. CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide suggestions into how further
      training in sport psychology for chartered physiotherapists could be delivered.
      To gain more detailed information on these issues, however, further research with
      a larger sample size is recommended.

      experience.
PG  - 48-54, 2
AB  - Coaching has traditionally been associated with sports, where coaches help teams 
      and individuals focus on improving their athletic performance and achieving top
      results. Coaches do not play the game; rather, they stand on the side and provide
      advice and guidance to those who are playing. Increasingly, organizations are
      recognizing the value of coaching to develop and train leaders, managers and
      employees to become top performers. Ontario's Wait Times Strategy--which was
      launched in November 2004--adopted the concept of coaching to help hospitals
      improve access to services and reduce wait times.

TI  - Health promotion profile of youth sports clubs in Finland: club officials' and
      coaches' perceptions.
PG  - 26-35
LID - 10.1093/heapro/dan040 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this article is to examine the current health promotion
      orientation of youth sports clubs in Finland in view of the standards created
      previously for the health promoting sports club (HPSC). Ninety-seven youth sports
      clubs participated, and 273 sports club officials and 240 coaches answered the
      questionnaires. To describe clubs health promotion orientations, an HPSC index
      was created. The HPSC index was formulated on sub-indices by factor analysis. The
      sub-indices were: policy, ideology, practice and environment indexes. The results
      indicate that youth sports clubs are fairly health promoting in general. On
      average, the clubs fulfilled 12 standards for HPSC out of 22. Every fourth club
      was categorized as higher health promoting (> or = 15 fulfilled standards), and
      every third as lower health promoting (<11 fulfilled standards). The variation
      between clubs was wide. The clubs that had been recognized as exemplary and hence
      certified by the Young Finland Association were more likely to recognize health
      promotion than non-certified clubs (OR = 2.36, p = 0.016). The sports club
      officials were twice as likely to evaluate their clubs as higher health promoting
      than the coaches (OR = 2.04, p = 0.041). Under the sub-indices, ideologies were
      recognized best, others less. These findings indicate that minority of the youth 
      sports clubs have realized health promotion comprehensively as a part of their
      activities. There is a lot of need for development, especially in the area of
      health promotion policies and practices. The instruments used proved valid and
      reliable and can therefore be recommended for international use.

TI  - Proximal and distal factors associated with dropout versus maintained
      participation in organized sport.
PG  - 9-16
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate a large number of determinants of
      sport dropout among French adolescents, in order to reveal proximal and distal
      factors of dropout. 261 current and 106 dropout athletes (M = 14.6) participated 
      to the study. The data were collected by a questionnaire assessing demographic
      information, athletes' perceptions on their experience, their parents, teammates 
      and coach. t-tests revealed that current and former athletes were distinct on
      numerous variables. A discriminant function analysis showed three proximal
      predictors of sport dropout (perceived value of the activity, satisfaction,
      parents' investment). Subsequent regression analyses showed that perceived value 
      was positively predicted by perceived competence, the value of the activity for
      teammates, coach's investment, and negatively by conflicts of interest and goal
      conflict with teammates; satisfaction was positively predicted by the coach's
      mastery climate, but negatively predicted by conflicts of interest and goal
      conflict with teammates and with the coach; parents investment was negatively
      predicted by the goal conflicts with them. This study permitted to discriminate
      between proximal and more distal psychological antecedents of the dropout
      behaviour. It brings information relative to the possible targets of
      interventions aiming at preventing dropout from organized sport. Key
      pointsGeographical, financial and time constraints did not predict dropout from
      organized sport.The value of the activity, the level of satisfaction of the
      athlete, and the perceived parental investment, were identified as proximal
      predictors of maintained participation.Athletes' perceptions about themselves
      (perceived competence, conflict of interest) or their coach (investment, climate,
      goal conflicts), peers (value, goal conflicts) or parents (goal conflicts), seem 
      to act as distal factors.

TI  - The sports science of curling: a practical review.
PG  - 495-500
AB  - Curling is a sport played on ice in which two teams each deliver 8 granite stones
      towards a target, or 'house'. It is the only sport in which the trajectory of the
      projectile can be influenced after it has been released by the athlete. This is
      achieved by sweeping the ice in front of the stone to change the stone-ice
      friction and thereby enable to stone to travel further, curl more or stay
      straight. Hard sweeping is physically demanding. Different techniques of sweeping
      can also have different effects on the stone. This paper will review the current 
      research behind sweeping a curling stone, outline the physiological demands of
      sweeping, the associated performance effects and suggest potential strategies of 
      sweeping that can be used by both coaches and curling teams. Key pointsSweeping a
      curling stone can be highly physically demanding.Effective sweeping requires a
      combination of downward force and brush head speed, determined by the stone
      velocity.Sweeping on the left or right of a stone can help the stone to remain
      straight or curl more depending on the rotation of the stone.This can lead to the
      development of sweeping and playing tactics and contribute to team selection.

TI  - [Anorexia athletica's place in female sports athletes].
PG  - 88-92
LID - 10.1016/j.arcped.2008.10.021 [doi]
AB  - This work analyzes the links between eating disorders and intensive exercise
      training and tries to define the anorexia athletica's place in this context.
      Through a review of the literature, we examined the arguments favoring the
      hypothesis of a "princeps" disorder, which would orientate girls towards some
      sports, and the arguments, which emphasize the capacity of some sports to lead to
      the apparition of these eating disorders. The description of a clinical case
      allows the evocation of the complexity of this relationship showing that
      intensive exercise training may be a facilitatory factor as well as a limitatory 
      factor of the severity of the anorexia nervosa. In this situation, it seems
      interesting to use the anorexia athletica's concept to improve coach and doctor's
      vigilance around the young female athlete. Lastly, we propose to replace the
      concept of sport by "exercise practice" where the intensity, the sport
      "centration", the weight stress became risk factors and to define populations at 
      risk (adolescents, females). Based on these data, prevention actions should be
      started in populations particularly exposed.

TI  - Efficacy of injury prevention related coach education within netball and soccer.
PG  - 32-5
LID - 10.1016/j.jsams.2008.07.010 [doi]
AB  - In 2004, Netball New Zealand and New Zealand Football adapted a generic 10-point 
      action plan for sports injury prevention, SportSmart, to create NetballSmart and 
      SoccerSmart, as part of their coach education programmes. A small-size
      descriptive study was conducted in both sports, to assess the efficacy of
      integrating sports injury prevention into coach education. NetballSmart was
      evaluated at the end of 2005, via a telephone survey of 217 coaches (53% response
      rate) who had attended a NetballSmart course earlier in the year. SoccerSmart was
      evaluated at the start of 2007, via an Internet questionnaire completed by 71
      coaches (20% response rate) who had attended a SoccerSmart course in 2006. The
      evaluations focused on the quality and use of the course resource material, as
      well as assessing the extent to which coaches had incorporated injury prevention 
      behaviours into player practices. After attending a NetballSmart course, 89% of
      coaches changed the way they coached, with 95% reported using knowledge from the 
      course and passing it on to players. Ninety-six percent of football/soccer
      coaches also changed the way they coached, with most change relating to
      warm-up/cool-down and stretch (65%), technique (63%), fitness (60%) and
      nutrition/hydration (58%) practices. Although this was a descriptive study in
      nature, with a small sample size, we conclude that integration of injury
      prevention content within coach education courses and resources may be a viable
      and effective strategy to help community coaches--and therefore community
      players--help reduce their risk of injury.

AB  - Weightlifting technique is a well-studied subject with regard to standard
      biomechanical analysis that includes barbell velocity as well as barbell
      trajectory, but kinematic data such as barbell acceleration have not often been
      reported. Real-time or near-real-time feedback can be more helpful to coaches and
      athletes than delayed feedback. The purpose of this study was to validate
      measures obtained by a commercially available accelerometer in comparison with
      kinematic data derived from video. The hypothesis was that there would be a high 
      positive relationship between accelerometer data and acceleration measures
      derived from video records of a barbell high-pull movement. Accelerometer values 
      and kinematic data from high-speed video were obtained from 7 volunteers
      performing 2 trials each of a barbell high-pull. The results showed that the
      accelerometer measures were highly correlated with derived acceleration data from
      video (r = 0.94-0.99). On the basis of these results, the device was considered
      to be validated; thus, the unit may be a useful tool to measure acceleration
      during real-time training sessions rather than only reserved for collecting data 
      in a laboratory setting. This device can be a valuable tool to provide instant
      feedback to coaches and athletes to assess individual barbell acceleration
      performance.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide background information on methodologic factors that
      influence and add variance to endocrine outcome measurements. Our intent is to
      aid and improve the quality of exercise science and sports medicine research
      endeavors of investigators inexperienced in endocrinology. BACKGROUND: Numerous
      methodologic factors influence human endocrine (hormonal) measurements and,
      consequently, can dramatically compromise the accuracy and validity of exercise
      and sports medicine research. These factors can be categorized into those that
      are biologic and those that are procedural-analytic in nature. RECOMMENDATIONS:
      Researchers should design their studies to monitor, control, and adjust for the
      biologic and procedural-analytic factors discussed within this paper. By doing
      so, they will find less variance in their hormonal outcomes and thereby will
      increase the validity of their physiologic data. These actions can assist the
      researcher in the interpretation and understanding of endocrine data and, in
      turn, make their research more scientifically sound.

AB  - Efforts at player motion tracking have traditionally involved a range of data
      collection techniques from live observation to post-event video analysis where
      player movement patterns are manually recorded and categorized to determine
      performance effectiveness. Due to the considerable time required to manually
      collect and analyse such data, research has tended to focus only on small numbers
      of players within predefined playing areas. Whilst notational analysis is a
      convenient, practical and typically inexpensive technique, the validity and
      reliability of the process can vary depending on a number of factors, including
      how many observers are used, their experience, and the quality of their viewing
      perspective. Undoubtedly the application of automated tracking technology to team
      sports has been hampered because of inadequate video and computational facilities
      available at sports venues. However, the complex nature of movement inherent to
      many physical activities also represents a significant hurdle to overcome.
      Athletes tend to exhibit quick and agile movements, with many unpredictable
      changes in direction and also frequent collisions with other players. Each of
      these characteristics of player behaviour violate the assumptions of smooth
      movement on which computer tracking algorithms are typically based. Systems such 
      as TRAKUS, SoccerMan, TRAKPERFORMANCE, Pfinder and Prozone all provide extrinsic 
      feedback information to coaches and athletes. However, commercial tracking
      systems still require a fair amount of operator intervention to process the data 
      after capture and are often limited by the restricted capture environments that
      can be used and the necessity for individuals to wear tracking devices. Whilst
      some online tracking systems alleviate the requirements of manual tracking, to
      our knowledge a completely automated system suitable for sports performance is
      not yet commercially available. Automatic motion tracking has been used
      successfully in other domains outside of elite sport performance, notably for
      surveillance in the military and security industry where automatic recognition of
      moving objects is achievable because identification of the objects is not
      necessary. The current challenge is to obtain appropriate video sequences that
      can robustly identify and label people over time, in a cluttered environment
      containing multiple interacting people. This problem is often compounded by the
      quality of video capture, the relative size and occlusion frequency of people,
      and also changes in illumination. Potential applications of an automated motion
      detection system are offered, such as: planning tactics and strategies; measuring
      team organisation; providing meaningful kinematic feedback; and objective
      measures of intervention effectiveness in team sports, which could benefit
      coaches, players, and sports scientists.

      Questionnaire.
PG  - 81-8
AB  - To explore athletes' perceptions related to coaching and athletic training care, 
      the Coaching and Athletic Training Questionnaire was developed. A 10-item version
      was administered to 708 varsity athletes from three Division I universities in
      the National Collegiate Athletic Association. 341 women and 344 men completed
      questionnaires. Data from half of the sample of 685 were used for an exploratory 
      factor analysis using principal components analysis with oblique rotation and the
      second half for a confirmatory factor analysis. Analyses yielded three
      interpretable factors, accounting for 68% of the variance, which were labeled
      Comfort with Athletic Trainer or Coach, Sex Influence on Quality of Care, and
      Athletic Trainer Preference. Multivariate analysis of variance indicated that
      factor scores of women and men differed significantly, and at followup women and 
      men differed significantly on Comfort with Athletic Trainer or Coach, but the
      small effect size minimizes its meaningfulness. No significant difference was
      noted for the other two factors. It appears coaches should be sensitive and
      available in case of injury or other need. Athletes' perceived quality of care by
      athletic trainers does not appear related to sex of athlete or trainer.

      mental illness.

AB  - Social support is important for people experiencing serious mental illness and is
      also important during the initiation and maintenance of exercise. In this article
      we draw on interpretive research into the experiences of 11 men with serious
      mental illness to explore four dimensions of social support both for and through 
      exercise. Our findings suggest that informational, tangible, esteem, and
      emotional support were both provided for and given by participants through
      exercise. We conclude that experiences of both receiving and giving diverse forms
      of support in this way are significant for some people living with and recovering
      from serious mental illness.

TI  - Passion in sport: on the quality of the coach-athlete relationship.
PG  - 541-60
AB  - Vallerand et al. (2003) developed a dualistic model of passion, wherein two types
      of passion are proposed: harmonious (HP) and obsessive (OP) passion that predict 
      adaptive and less adaptive interpersonal outcomes, respectively. In the present
      research, we were interested in understanding the role of passion in the quality 
      of coach-athlete relationships. Results of Study 1, conducted with athletes
      (N=157), revealed that HP positively predicts a high-quality coach-athlete
      relationship, whereas OP was largely unrelated to such relationships. Study 2 was
      conducted with coaches (N=106) and showed that only HP positively predicted the
      quality of the coach-athlete relationship. Furthermore, these effects were fully 
      mediated by positive emotions. Finally, the quality of the coach-athlete
      relationship positively predicted coaches' subjective well-being. Future research
      directions are discussed in light of the dualistic model of passion.

TI  - [Sports injuries of temporomandibular joints and oral muscles in basketball
      players].
PG  - 19-22
AB  - All sporting activities have an associated risk of orofacial injuries due to
      falls, collisions with players, devices, and hard surfaces. Many authors have
      reported about incidence of orofacial injuries during sports activities. Flanders
      and Bhat concluded that 34% of all injuries in basketball are orofacial injuries,
      while orofacial injuries account for only 0.07% of all injuries in American
      football. AIM, METHODS AND EXAMINEES: The aim of this investigation was to
      identify the incidence, type and severity of temporomandibular joint injuries,
      stiffness and pain in oral muscles, and pain during opening and closure of the
      mouth while playing basketball. The sample consisted of 195 basketball players,
      135 professionals and 60 non-professionals. They filled out the questionnaire
      individually with help of the researchers. RESULTS: The data received by the
      survey revealed a total of 350 temporomandibular joint injuries and/or pain, oral
      muscles stiffness and pain during opening and closure of the mouth during
      basketball career. The incidence of injuries was higher in professional 72.6%
      (254) than in non-professional players 27.4% (96). Twenty-four professional and 9
      non-professional players reported pain or oral muscles stiffness, while 58
      professional and 15 non-professional players reported pain during opening and
      closing the mouth. Only 1 non-professional player and 6 professional players
      reported injuries of the temporomandibular joint. All basketball players who were
      injured during their career had more than one injury. During career, professional
      players reported pain while opening and closing of the mouth more often than
      non-professional players, on the average 1.3 and 0.9 times, respectively. Pain or
      oral muscles stiffness during basketball career was reported 0.6 times on the
      average by non-professional players, as compared to 0.5 times by professional
      players. Non-professional players reported 5.2% injuries of temporomandibular
      joints during their career, while professional players only 3.2%. With regard to 
      positions in the team, most injuries of temporomandibular joints, stiffness and
      pain in oral muscles were reported by forwards, on the average 2.33 incidents.
      Centers were the second most frequently injured group with an average of 1.96
      incidents, followed by point guards with 1.74, power forwards with 1.62 and
      guards with 1.55 incidents. CONCLUSION: Only 2 basketball players (1%) frequently
      used a mouthguard and 93.3% of them never even tried to wear a mouthguard.
      Implementation of mandatory mouthguard usage in sports, such as basketball, would
      decrease such a large number of sports injuries. Mouthguards would absorb the
      force of impact and consequently stiffness and pain in oral muscles so that
      injuries of temporomandibular joints would be reduced or even avoided. Such a low
      percentage of mouthguard use in basketball players reflects poor awareness and
      education of both athletes and coaches, as well as an insufficient role of
      dentists in sports medicine and education.

TI  - [Development of a scale to measure leadership capacity of players in sports
      teams].
PG  - 913-7
AB  - This study describes the process of developing a scale to measure the leadership 
      capacity of players in sports teams. Research into sports leadership has focused 
      almost exclusively on the formal leadership of the coach, in which the studies by
      Chelladurai, with his five-factor model, have become an essential point of
      reference. Nevertheless, hardly any research has been carried out into the
      leadership that certain players exercise over the other team members. For this
      purpose, a sample of 143 male basketball players was used; these participants
      were asked to evaluate the characteristics of the sports leader over a total of
      54 indicators. Firstly, explanatory factor analysis was performed with
      participants' responses, using principal axis and oblique rotation methods. The
      factor structure obtained was then subjected to confirmatory factorial analysis, 
      enabling us to propose a Sports Leader Evaluation Scale (EELD, in Spanish) with
      18 items grouped into 3 factors, denominated empathy and responsibility,
      assertiveness, and impulsiveness. Satisfactory fit indices were obtained for the 
      model, for the reliability of items and for the internal consistency of factors.

TI  - A confirmatory study of rating scale category effectiveness for the Coaching
      Efficacy Scale.
PG  - 300-11
AB  - This study extended validity evidence for measures of coaching efficacy derived
      from the Coaching Efficacy Scale (CES) by testing the rating scale
      categorizations suggested in previous research. Previous research provided
      evidence for the effectiveness of a four-category (4-CAT) structure for high
      school and collegiate sports coaches; it also suggested that a five-category
      (5-CAT) structure may be effective for youth sports coaches, because they may be 
      more likely to endorse categories on the lower end of the scale. Coaches of youth
      sports (N = 492) responded to the CES items with a 5-CAT structure. Across rating
      scale category effectiveness guidelines, 32 of 34 evidences (94%) provided
      support for this structure. Data were condensed to a 4-CAT structure by
      collapsing responses in Category 1 (CAT-1) and Category 2 (CAT-2). Across rating 
      scale category effectiveness guidelines, 25 of 26 evidences (96%) provided
      support for this structure. Findings provided confirmatory, cross-validation
      evidence for both the 5-CAT and 4-CAT structures. For empirical, theoretical, and
      practical reasons, the authors concluded that the 4-CAT structure was preferable 
      to the 5-CAT when CES items are used to measure coaching efficacy. This
      conclusion is based on the findings of this confirmatory study and the more
      exploratory findings of Myers, Wolfe, and Feltz (2005).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize differences in the perception and understanding of the
      placebo effect between sports physicians, coaches, athletes, and sports science
      personnel. DESIGN: A short 11-item questionnaire was administered addressing
      demographic details, understanding of the placebo effect, and willingness to use 
      the effect in an elite sport setting. SETTING: All participants were involved in 
      national level sporting programs. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 187 individuals (17
      sports physicians, 44 sports scientists, 30 national-level coaches, and 96
      national-level athletes) completed the questionnaire. All participants were
      contacted and invited to participate voluntarily. INTERVENTIONS/ASSESSMENT OF
      RISK FACTORS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported responses 
      on understanding and use of placebo effect in sport. RESULTS: A total of 94% of
      physicians and 98% of scientists, but only 44% of athletes, indicated a good
      understanding of the placebo effect. A majority of scientists (63%) and
      physicians (59%) administered placebo at least once a year. Most of scientists
      (95%) and a majority of physicians (71%) either mildly or strongly encouraged use
      of the placebo in their clinical practice. About 60% of athletes indicated they
      would not care if they were unknowingly administered a placebo: however, 30% of
      them would not appreciate being misled. CONCLUSIONS: There is a substantial
      difference in the level of understanding of the placebo effect between physicians
      and athletes in elite sport. Although athletes are willing to use the placebo
      effect, physicians need to be mindful of the manner of its implementation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe and identify predictors of 12-month outcomes of serious
      orthopaedic injuries due to sport and active recreation. DESIGN: Prospective
      cohort study with 12-month follow-up. SETTING: Two Level 1 adult trauma centers
      in Victoria, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 366 adults admitted to two Level
      1 trauma centers for an orthopaedic sport and active recreation injury between
      August 2003 and March 2006. Patients were captured by the Victorian Orthopaedic
      Trauma Outcomes Registry (VOTOR), followed up at 12 months, and were free of
      moderate to severe disability prior to injury. ASSESSMENT OF RISK FACTORS:
      Independent variables assessed for predictors of outcome were sporting group,
      age, sex, marital status, education level, Injury Severity Score, injury
      patterns, and head injury status. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: The 12-item Short
      Form Health Survey and maximum pain scores. RESULTS: At 12 months postinjury,
      22.8% of patients reported moderate to severe physical disability, 12.1% reported
      moderate to severe mental health disability, and 11.1% reported moderate to
      severe pain. There were significant differences in physical outcomes between
      sporting groups, with motor and equestrian sports reporting the worst physical
      outcomes. Multivariate analysis indentified increasing age (P = 0.010) and
      patterns of injury (P = 0.040) as significant predictors of a poor physical
      outcome at 12 months. No significant independent predictors of outcome for mental
      health and maximum pain at 12 months were identified. CONCLUSION: Almost
      one-quarter of participants reported moderate to severe physical disability at 12
      months postinjury. Increasing age and patterns of injury were found to be
      significant predictors of a poor physical outcome at 12 months.

TI  - On passion and sports fans: a look at football.
PG  - 1279-93
LID - 10.1080/02640410802123185 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of the present research was to test the applicability of the
      Dualistic Model of Passion (Vallerand et al., 2003) to being a sport (football)
      fan. Three studies provided support for this dualistic conceptualization of
      passion. Study 1 showed that harmonious passion was positively associated with
      adaptive behaviours (e.g. celebrate the team's victory), whereas obsessive
      passion was positively associated with maladaptive behaviours (e.g. risking
      losing one's job to go to a game). Study 2 used a short Passion Scale and showed 
      that harmonious passion was positively related to the positive affective life of 
      fans during the 2006 FIFA World Cup, psychological health (self-esteem and life
      satisfaction), and public displays of adaptive behaviours (e.g. celebrate the
      team's victory into the streets), whereas obsessive passion was predictive of
      maladaptive affective life (e.g. hating opposing teams' fans) and behaviours
      (e.g. mocking opposing teams' fans). Finally, Study 3 examined the role of
      obsessive passion as a predictor of partner's conflict that in turn undermined
      partner's relationship satisfaction. Overall, the present results provided
      support for the Dualistic Model of Passion. The conceptual and applied
      implications of the findings are discussed.

TI  - Assessing Autonomy-Supportive Coaching Strategies in Youth Sport.
PG  - 671-684
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Autonomy support is a component of the motivational climate in youth 
      sport that may promote youth's internalization of behaviors and attitudes. This
      study examined the psychometric properties of the Autonomy-Supportive Coaching
      Questionnaire (ASCQ), a measure of two forms of autonomy-supportive coaching
      perceived by young athletes. DESIGN: The study design was non-experimental.
      METHODS: Over a six-week season, youth (N = 165) participating in a recreational 
      summer swim league completed measures of perceived coaching behavior (weeks 1 and
      5), autonomy-supportive coaching (week 5) and psychological need satisfaction
      (weeks 1 and 6). RESULTS: Responses to the ASCQ could be reduced to two
      correlated factors representing an "interest in athlete's input" and "praise for 
      autonomous behavior." These factors exhibited slightly different relations with
      perceived coaching behaviors and positively predicted coaching-associated
      contrasts in the satisfaction of all three basic psychological needs.
      CONCLUSIONS: The ASCQ appears to provide a valid assessment of young athlete's
      perceptions of autonomy-supportive coaching. Autonomy-supportive coaching should 
      be evaluated as a potential source of motivational consequences of coaching and
      as a potential moderator of coaching effects on youth internalization.

TI  - Contractual obligations and the sharing of confidential health information in
      sport.
PG  - e6
LID - 10.1136/jme.2008.024794 [doi]
AB  - As an employee, a sports doctor has obligations to their employer, but also
      professional and widely accepted obligations of a doctor to the patient (in this 
      case the individual team member). The conflict is evident when sports doctors are
      asked by an athlete to keep personal health information confidential from the
      coach and team management, and yet both doctor and athlete have employment
      contracts specifying that such information shall be shared. Recent research in
      New Zealand shows that despite the presence of an employment contract, there
      appears to be a wide range of behaviours among sports doctors when an athlete
      requests that information about them be kept from team management. Many seem
      willing to honour requests to keep health information about the athlete
      confidential, thereby being in breach of the employment contract, while others
      insist on informing team management against the wishes of the athlete. There are 
      a number of potential solutions to this dilemma from forcing doctors to meet
      their contractual obligations, to limiting the expectations of the employment
      contract. This paper suggests that at times it may be appropriate to do both,
      making the position of the doctor clearer and supporting the ability of this
      group to resist pressure by coaches and management through having a robust code
      of ethics.

TI  - Virtual harm reduction efforts for Internet gambling: effects of deposit limits
      on actual Internet sports gambling behavior.
PG  - 27
LID - 10.1186/1477-7517-5-27 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In an attempt to reduce harm related to gambling problems, an
      Internet sports betting service provider, bwin Interactive Entertainment, AG
      (bwin), imposes limits on the amount of money that users can deposit into their
      online gambling accounts. We examined the effects of these limits on gambling
      behavior. METHODS: We compared (1) gambling behavior of those who exceeded
      deposit limits with those who did not, and (2) gambling behavior before and after
      exceeding deposit limits. We analyzed 2 years of the actual sports gambling
      behavior records of 47000 subscribers to bwin. RESULTS: Only 160 (0.3%) exceeded 
      deposit limits at least once. Gamblers who exceeded deposit limits evidenced
      higher average number of bets per active betting day and higher average size of
      bets than gamblers who did not exceed deposit limits. Comparing the gambling
      behavior before and after exceeding deposit limits revealed slightly more
      unfavorable gambling behavior after exceeding deposit limits. CONCLUSION: Our
      findings indicate that Internet gamblers who exceed deposit limits constitute a
      group of bettors willing to take high risks; yet, surprisingly, they appear to do
      this rather successfully because their percentage of losses is lower than others 
      in the sample. However, some of these gamblers exhibit some poor outcomes.
      Deposit limits might be necessary harm reduction measures to prevent the loss of 
      extremely large amounts of money and cases of bankruptcy. We discuss how these
      limits might be modified based on our findings.

TI  - Discordance in injury reporting between youth-athletes, their parents and
      coaches.
PG  - 633-6
LID - 10.1016/j.jsams.2008.06.001 [doi]
AB  - Hiring experienced health professionals to collect data on sport injuries is
      expensive, limits resources, and may be prohibitive for surveillance studies. The
      objective of this study was to obtain pilot data on whether youth self-report
      deserves further study. We followed 67 recreational and elite soccer players aged
      11-17 for one season and compared responses of injured players with those of
      their parents/coaches. We defined our main outcome of discordance as any
      disagreement in responses between the youth, parent and coach (triad). When one
      person didn't know the answer, we categorised the responses as "concordance" if
      the other two members agreed. We omitted data when two people responded "Don't
      Know". Of 10 injuries that could be analysed, 29/30 interviews occurred within 21
      days. For factual questions analysed, there was 100% concordance for the type and
      side of injury, and place where the injury occurred. There were 1-2 discordant
      triads for each of time of day, activity during injury and specific body part
      injured. There were greater discordances for date of injury, first-aid treatment,
      and opinions concerning underlying reasons for the injury. Interview-report by
      youth themselves should be explored as a possible low cost method of documenting 
      youth sport injuries.

TI  - Interventions implemented through sporting organisations for increasing
      participation in sport.
PG  - CD004812
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD004812.pub3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is now compelling scientific evidence that increased levels of 
      physical activity can bring wide-ranging health benefits. These benefits can
      extend beyond physical health to include other positive impacts relating to
      mental health and personal development. The sport and recreation sector is viewed
      as a priority area for increasing rates of physical activity. Participation rates
      in organised sport have been shown to be lower in females and to decline with
      age, and are reduced in lower socio-economic and minority groups including people
      from non-English speaking and Indigenous backgrounds. It is important to
      determine the most effective interventions that sporting organisations can use to
      increase people's participation. OBJECTIVES: To update a review of all controlled
      studies evaluating interventions implemented through sporting organisations to
      increase participation. SEARCH STRATEGY: We updated the original (2004) searches 
      in May 2007. We searched: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
      (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 2 2007); MEDLINE and MEDLINE In-Process and
      Other Non-Indexed Citations (2004 to Week 3 April 2007); EMBASE (2004 to Week 17 
      2007); PsyclNFO (2004 to April Week 1 2007); CINAHL (2004 to Week 1 May 2007);
      SPORTDiscus (2004 to April 2007); Sociological Abstracts (2004 to 2007);
      Dissertation Abstracts (2004 to May 2007), and a number of freely-available
      online health promotion and sports-related databases. We used the internet
      extensively to search for studies and locate information generated by sporting
      bodies throughout the world. SELECTION CRITERIA: Controlled studies evaluating
      any intervention designed to increase active and/ or non-active participation in 
      sport by people of all ages. Interventions could include: mass media campaigns;
      information or education sessions; management or organisational change
      strategies; policy changes, for example to improve the socio-cultural environment
      to encourage people of specific age, gender or ethnicity to participate; changes 
      to traditional or existing programs, for example club or association-initiated
      rule modification programs; provision of activities beyond traditional or
      existing programs, for example 'Come and Try' initiatives (teaser or taster
      programs); skill improvement programs; volunteer encouragement programs.
      Uncontrolled studies which met other inclusion criteria were to be reported in an
      annex to the review. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We assessed whether identified
      citations met the inclusion criteria. Two review authors independently inspected 
      abstracts (NP, RA). We obtained full papers where necessary. As we located no
      controlled evaluation studies, we did not undertake data collection or analysis. 
      We found no uncontrolled studies meeting other inclusion criteria, and therefore 
      present no annex to the review. MAIN RESULTS: Despite a thorough review of the
      published and unpublished literature, we found no rigorous studies evaluating the
      effects of interventions organised through sporting organisations to increase
      participation in sport. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is an absence of high quality
      evidence to support interventions designed and delivered by sporting
      organisations to increase participation in sport. Interventions funded and
      conducted in this area must be linked to a rigorous evaluation strategy in order 
      to examine overall effectiveness, socio-demographic differentials in
      participation and cost-effectiveness of these strategies.

TI  - Intervening with coaches to promote awareness and prevention of weight pressures 
      in cheerleaders.
PG  - 102-10
AB  - Research has found that athletes, particularly those involved in "aesthetically
      oriented" sports, experience significant pressures for thinness and are at
      increased risk for developing eating disorders. This study targeted cheerleading 
      coaches as potential change agents by training them to recognize the symptoms of 
      eating disorders and reduce the pressures for thinness among their squads.
      Cheerleading coaches at national or regional conferences attended an intervention
      workshop or a control workshop. Coaches who attended the intervention workshop
      received information regarding negative coaching behaviors, the symptoms of
      eating disorders, and ways to manage athletes with eating disorders. In addition,
      intervention coaches were encouraged to participate in six intervention
      strategies (e.g., reading materials, video, parent handouts, etc.) after
      attending the workshop. Eight months following the workshop, the coaches
      completed an assessment battery designed to test the effectiveness of the entire 
      intervention. The results indicated that the intervention was successful in
      producing behavior changes in coaches. However, the intervention was less
      successful in producing long-term change in knowledge about eating disorders.
      These findings imply that interventions can be implemented by important adult
      figures (e.g., coaches, teachers) but the overall effectiveness of these
      interventions must be enhanced in order to have a significant and long-term
      impact.

LID - 10.1016/j.ymeth.2008.06.001 [doi]
AB  - Key methodological issues for designing, analyzing, and interpreting neuroimaging
      experiments are presented from the perspective of the framework of Coordination
      Dynamics. To this end, a brief overview of Coordination Dynamics is introduced,
      including the main concepts of control parameters and collective variables,
      theoretical modeling, novel experimental paradigms, and cardinal empirical
      findings. Basic conceptual and methodological issues for the design and
      implementation of coordination experiments in the context of neuroimaging are
      discussed. The paper concludes with a presentation of neuroimaging findings
      central to understanding the neural basis of coordination and addresses their
      relevance for the sport sciences. The latter include but are not restricted to
      learning and practice-related issues, the role of mental imagery, and the
      recovery of function following brain injury.

TI  - Associations between parents' and 12-year-old children's sport and vigorous
      activity: the role of self-esteem and athletic competence.
PG  - 359-73
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aims of this study were to investigate parent-child physical
      activity (PA) associations and whether children's self-esteem or athletic
      competence mediates such associations. METHODS: The study population comprised
      1124 12-year-old children and their parents. Parents' PA was assessed using the
      Baecke questionnaire and a question about sport participation. Children's PA was 
      assessed by questions about participation in sport and vigorous activities. The
      children's self-esteem and athletic competence were assessed by Harter's
      Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents. RESULTS: Parents' PA was strongly
      associated with their children's PA. With 2 active parents, the odds ratio for
      their children to participate in sport was 3.9 (95% CI = 2.2-6.9, girls) and 8.8 
      (95% CI = 4.3-18.0, boys) compared with having inactive parents. Athletic
      competence partly mediated these associations. CONCLUSIONS: The family is an
      important target for interventions to increase PA among children, and it might be
      important to consider ways to reinforce children's athletic competence.

TI  - Stressors in elite sport: a coach perspective.
PG  - 905-18
LID - 10.1080/02640410801885933 [doi]
AB  - We examined the varying performance and organizational stressors experienced by
      coaches who operate with elite athletes. Following interviews with eleven
      coaches, content analysis of the data revealed coaches to experience comparable
      numbers of performance and organizational stressors. Performance stressors were
      divided between their own performance and that of their athletes, while
      organizational stressors included environmental, leadership, personal, and team
      factors. The findings provide evidence that coaches experience a variety of
      stressors that adds weight to the argument that they should be labelled as
      "performers" in their own right. A variety of future research topics and applied 
      issues are also discussed.

TI  - BodySense: an evaluation of a positive body image intervention on sport climate
      for female athletes.
PG  - 308-21
LID - 10.1080/10640260802115910 [doi]
AB  - The goal of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a selective
      prevention program designed to reduce pressures to be thin in sport, and to
      promote positive body image and eating behaviors in young female athletes.
      Participants were competitive female gymnasts (aged 11 to 18 years), parents, and
      coaches from 7 gymnastic clubs across Ontario, Canada. Four of the seven clubs
      were randomized to receive the 3-month intervention program (IG) aimed at
      increasing awareness and positive climate change of body image pressures for
      athletes in their clubs. Three clubs were randomized to the control group (CG). A
      total of 62 female gymnasts (IG n = 31; CG n = 31) completed self-report
      questionnaires examining perceptions of pressure to be thin within their sports
      clubs, self-efficacy over dieting pressures, awareness and internalization of
      societal pressure to be thin, body esteem, and eating attitudes and behaviours
      before and following the intervention. A total of 32 mothers (IG n = 24; CG n =
      8) completed measures examining their perceptions of their daughter's pressure to
      be thin, awareness and internalization of societal pressures to be thin,
      daughter's self-efficacy over dieting pressures, in addition to mothers' beliefs 
      regarding thinness and success for women in society, before and following the
      intervention. The findings revealed that participation in the BodySense program
      resulted in athletes perceiving a reduction in pressure from their sports clubs
      to be thin, though no changes were found in body esteem, the EAT, or the SATAQ.
      No significant change was observed over time on mothers' measures. The role of
      climate change for prevention of eating disorders in athletes is discussed.

TI  - [Eating disorders in sports: risk factors, health consequences, treatment and
      prevention].
PG  - 183-90
AB  - Eating disorders appear with relative frequency in sports, such as gymnastics,
      figure skating or resistance sports, in which weight control is important. Their 
      incidence is greater in women, frequently appearing a low self-esteem, a
      distorted body image in which the body is perceived with an excess of weight,
      inefficiency, perfectionism and a sense of control loss, with compensatory
      attempts exerted through food manipulation and the use of inadequate methods of
      control weight. Frequently, they are associated in female athletes to
      irregularities of the menstrual cycle, reduction of the bone mineral density and 
      osteoporosis, giving rise to so-called female athlete triad. Cardiovascular
      problems, a greater incidence of fractures, and muscular power and resistance
      losses which impair performance, can also develop. Between the risk for their
      appearance are attempts to lose weight, often by recommendation of the coach,
      increases of training loads associated to weight losses, characteristics of the
      personality that take to excessive preoccupation by body image, or injuries and
      traumatisms. Treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach, with participation 
      of physicians, psychologists/psychiatrists, nutricionists, coaches and family,
      being specially important the emphasis on preventive measures.

TI  - The triple-120 meter shuttle test: a sport-specific test for assessing anaerobic 
      endurance fitness in rugby league players.
PG  - 633-9
LID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e31816600e9 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to design a simple field test to measure the anaerobic 
      endurance fitness of rugby league players, which is an important fitness quality 
      in the game of rugby league. Twelve amateur football players with a mean (+/-SD) 
      age of 21.5 years (+/-2.2) volunteered to participate in the study. The subjects 
      completed 1 trial of the Wingate 60-second (W60) cycle test and 2 trials of the
      new Triple-120 meter shuttle (T120S) test. All trials were completed 4 days
      apart. The validity of the T120S was determined by comparing physiological
      responses (heart rate and blood lactate) and rating of perceived exertion to the 
      all-out W60 cycle test. The results indicate there is a significant relationship 
      between maximum heart rate (r = 0.63 and 0.71) for the 2 trials of the T120S and 
      the W60 cycle test. There was no significant relationship between the 2 trials
      and the W60 cycle test for post 3 minute lactate (r = 0.112 and 0.101) and rating
      of perceived exertion (r = 0.94 and 0.161). However, the T120S test elicited
      greater mean values for these measures than the W60 cycle test. The results
      indicate that the T120S is a valid test of anaerobic endurance and represents a
      sports specific test of this quality that may provide useful information for
      players and coaches involved in the sport of rugby league.

      judokas.
PG  - 350-8
LID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181635d25 [doi]
AB  - This study evaluated the sport-specific characteristics of the cross-sectional
      areas (CSAs) of trunk muscles and trunk muscle strength in wrestlers and judokas.
      We also examined whether their trunk muscles and muscle strength depended on
      athletic performance levels in each sport. The subjects comprised 14 male
      collegiate wrestlers and 14 judokas. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to
      assess the trunk muscle CSAs at the L3-4 level parallel to the lumbar disc space.
      A Biodex System3 was used to measure isokinetic trunk flexor and extensor muscle 
      strength of peak torque, work, average torque, and average power. The absolute
      and relative CSAs of the trunk muscles in the wrestlers and judokas were
      significantly different (rectus abdominis: wrestling > judo, P < 0.05; obliques: 
      wrestling < judo, P < 0.05; quadratus lumborum: wrestling < judo, P < 0.01). We
      confirmed that the absolute and relative trunk extensor and flexor strength of
      peak torque, work, and average torque were significantly higher in the collegiate
      wrestlers than in judokas. On athletic performance, the tendency of the CSAs and 
      muscular strength of trunk muscles was not consistent with athletic performance
      levels in each sport. Our findings indicated that the sport-specific
      characteristics of the CSAs of the trunk muscles and trunk muscle strength
      obviously differed between the 2 similar sports. Athletes should practice the
      sport-specific training of trunk muscles and develop sport specificity in their
      sports. Particularly, wrestlers have to train in trunk flexion and extension
      motions, and judokas need to strengthen trunk rotation and lateral flexion
      motions. This information will be available for athletes as well as strength and 
      technical training coaches in wrestling, judo, and the other sports.

TI  - Athletic trainers' and physical therapists' perceptions of the effectiveness of
      psychological skills within sport injury rehabilitation programs.
PG  - 258-64
LID - 10.4085/1062-6050-43.3.258 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Psychological skills are alleged to augment sport-injury rehabilitation;
      however, implementation of mental imagery within rehabilitation programs is
      limited. OBJECTIVE: To examine attitudes of athletic trainers (ATs) and physical 
      therapists (PTs) on the effectiveness of mental imagery, goal setting, and
      positive self-talk to improve rehabilitation adherence and recovery speed of
      injured athletes. DESIGN: The ATs and PTs were contacted via electronic or
      physical mailings to complete a single administration survey that measured their 
      beliefs about the effectiveness of psychological skills for increasing adherence 
      and recovery speed of injured athletes undergoing rehabilitation. SETTING:
      Professional member databases of the National Athletic Trainers' Association and 
      the American Physical Therapy Association. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Of the
      1000 ATs and 1000 PTs who were selected randomly, 309 ATs (age = 34.18 +/- 8.32
      years, years in profession = 10.67 +/- 7.34) and 356 PTs (age = 38.58 +/- 7.51
      years, years in profession = 13.18 +/- 6.17) responded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): 
      The Attitudes About Imagery (AAI) survey measures attitudes about psychological
      skills for enhancing adherence and recovery speed of injured athletes. The AAI
      includes demographic questions and 15 items on a 7-point Likert scale measuring
      attitudes about the effectiveness of mental imagery, self-talk, goal setting, and
      pain control on rehabilitation adherence and recovery speed of injured athletes. 
      Test-retest reliability ranged from .60 to .84 and Cronbach alphas ranged from
      .65 to .90. We calculated 1-way analyses of variance to determine whether
      differences existed in attitudes as a result of the professionals' education,
      training experience, and interest. RESULTS: Mean differences were found on
      attitudes about effectiveness of psychological skills for those who reported
      formal training and those who reported interest in receiving formal training (P <
      .05). In addition, ATs held more positive attitudes than PTs on 9 of 15 AAI items
      (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, ATs and PTs held positive attitudes on the
      effectiveness of psychological skills to augment the rehabilitation process.
      Clinical implications regarding the use of mental skills are discussed.

AB  - Sports success is dependent primarily on genetic endowment in athletes with
      morphologic, psychologic, physiologic and metabolic traits specific to
      performance characteristics vital to their sport. Such genetically-endowed
      athletes must also receive optimal training to increase physical power, enhance
      mental strength, and provide a mechanical advantage. However, athletes often
      attempt to go beyond training and use substances and techniques, often referred
      to as ergogenics, in attempts to gain a competitive advantage. Pharmacological
      agents, such as anabolic steroids and amphetamines, have been used in the past,
      but such practices by athletes have led to the establishment of anti-doping
      legislation and effective testing protocols to help deter their use. Thus, many
      athletes have turned to various dietary strategies, including the use of various 
      dietary supplements (sports supplements), which they presume to be effective,
      safe and legal.

TI  - Common lower limb sport-related overuse injuries in young athletes.
PG  - 315-9
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sports injuries in children and adolescent present a unique
      challenge to the physician. They are often seen for clinical conditions unique to
      their age group. This paper highlights the epidemiological aspect of
      sports-related overuse injuries in this age group. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This
      retrospective study reviewed all the paediatric patients diagnosed with overuses 
      injuries during a 5 years and 7 months period. The overuse injuries were anterior
      superior iliac spine avulsion fracture, Osgood-Schlatter disease,
      Sinding-Larson-Johansson disease, osteochondritis dissecan and Sever's disease.
      We reviewed the literature and attempted to give an overview for each condition
      and the anatomical differences that contributed to their occurrence in this age
      group. RESULTS: A total of 506 cases of the overuse injuries were seen during the
      study period. Seventy-three per cent were male patients. The knee joint was the
      commonest affected joint while the hip was the least affected joint. The mean age
      at diagnosis was younger in female compared to male for all conditions except in 
      Sinding-Larson Johansson syndrome. Female was diagnosed at a mean age of 11.7
      years while male at 10.8 years. Osgood-Schlatter disease was the commonest among 
      the overuse injuries. There was no discernible racial predilection for these
      conditions except in the patients with anterior superior iliac spine avulsion.
      CONCLUSIONS: Overuse injuries are not uncommon in children and adolescent. An
      adequate understanding of the anatomy of the sports the children participated in 
      as well as the anatomical differences between adult and children may assist the
      primary care providers better meet parents' and coaches' expectations.

TI  - Dehydration rates and rehydration efficacy of water and sports drink during one
      hour of moderate intensity exercise in well-trained flatwater kayakers.
PG  - 261-5
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study is to investigate the amount of water loss
      and percentage dehydration experienced during 1 hour of paddling on the kayak
      ergometer so as to help coaches and athletes tailor a suitable and adequate
      rehydration regime. Also, rehydration efficacy between water and a well
      established, commercially available sports drink (Gatorade, Quaker Oats company, 
      USA) was investigated in this cross-over study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten
      national flatwater kayakers were monitored in a controlled setting while paddling
      the kayak ergometer for 1 hour at an intensity sustainable for long distance
      marathon. They rehydrated themselves ad libitum with provided beverage. Post-void
      towel-dried body mass was measured before and after the exercise with percentage 
      dehydration calculated. Body core temperature (tympanic temperatures), ratings of
      perceived exertion and thirst index were monitored every 15 minutes. The amount
      of fluid consumed, urine output and urine specific gravity were obtained after
      exercise. RESULTS: The results [mean +/- standard deviation (SD)] showed that
      kayakers underwent 1.10 +/- 0.52% dehydration while rehydrating with water as
      compared to 0.72 +/- 0.38% while rehydrating with Gatorade. Also, athletes on
      water rehydration had higher rating of perceived exertion (RPE) at the 30th and
      60th minute mark of the exercise. Overall, athletes undergoing water rehydration 
      lost significantly more body mass (0.70 +/- 0.39 kg) as compared to rehydrating
      with Gatorade (0.46 +/- 0.27). CONCLUSION: Although the hydration efficacy of
      Gatorade proved superior to that of water, the athletes' hydration habits with
      either fluids did not provide adequate hydration. It is recommended that specific
      strategies be developed to address dehydration and rehydration issues of kayakers
      in Singapore.

TI  - 'I know it is only exercise, but to me it is something that keeps me going': a
      qualitative approach to understanding mental health service users' experiences of
      sports therapy.
PG  - 197-207

AB  - The relationship between exercise and mental health is well documented and has
      led to the inclusion of exercise into the treatment of people with mental health 
      problems. A qualitative (grounded theory) methodology, using focus groups,
      investigated the experiences of people with mental health problems, who had
      successfully participated in exercise as part of their treatment. The aim of this
      study was to investigate the experiences of service users who had successfully
      participated in sports therapy as part of their treatment. One of the researchers
      is also a service user who has participated in sports therapy and these
      experiences provided an insight into the research, especially in the design of
      the interview schedule, data collection (empathy with participants), and in the
      interpretation of the data. The dual role of service user and researcher is
      commended in contemporary mental health research and as such makes this study
      unique. A conceptual model is presented that explains the participants'
      subjective experiences, opinions, and perceptions of the role exercise has in
      their treatment, and their perceived outcomes from participation. The findings
      support sports therapy as an acceptable and beneficial adjunct to usual treatment
      for some people with mental health problems within the community, but that
      problems exist regarding knowledge and understanding of the theory underpinning
      its use.

TI  - Caffeine use in sports: considerations for the athlete.
PG  - 978-86
LID - 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181660cec [doi]
AB  - The ergogenic effects of caffeine on athletic performance have been shown in many
      studies, and its broad range of metabolic, hormonal, and physiologic effects has 
      been recorded, as this review of the literature shows. However, few caffeine
      studies have been published to include cognitive and physiologic considerations
      for the athlete. The following practical recommendations consider the global
      effects of caffeine on the body: Lower doses can be as effective as higher doses 
      during exercise performance without any negative coincidence; after a period of
      cessation, restarting caffeine intake at a low amount before performance can
      provide the same ergogenic effects as acute intake; caffeine can be taken
      gradually at low doses to avoid tolerance during the course of 3 or 4 days, just 
      before intense training to sustain exercise intensity; and caffeine can improve
      cognitive aspects of performance, such as concentration, when an athlete has not 
      slept well. Athletes and coaches also must consider how a person's body size,
      age, gender, previous use, level of tolerance, and the dose itself all influence 
      the ergogenic effects of caffeine on sports performance.

PG  - 254-9
AB  - The purpose of this research was to study the role of coaches' communication
      style and coach-created motivational climate in young soccer players' enjoyment
      and commitment. Four hundred and fifteen young soccer players of high competitive
      level in the age range from 14 to 16 completed the following questionnaires: a)
      coach-induced perceived motivational climate (PMCSQ-2), b) coaches' behaviour
      perception (CBAS-PBS), and c) sport commitment (SCQ). Results showed that
      coach-created motivational climate correlated highly with the perception of
      coaches' communication style. Moreover, coach-created motivational climate and
      communication style significantly determines players' sport commitment and
      enjoyment. Discussion focuses on the importance of seeking and training credible 
      coaches that favours athletes' commitment.

LID - 10.1177/1524839907309377 [doi]
AB  - This study evaluated school coaches' perceptions, assessments, and use of a
      toolkit to prevent and manage concussions among school athletes. A
      computer-assisted telephone survey was conducted with a stratified, random sample
      of high school coaches (n = 497; response rate = 39.3%; cooperation rate = 81.5%)
      from five states. Most reported that they had used or planned to use kit
      materials. Most (81%) in schools with a written plan for preventing and managing 
      concussions indicated that the toolkit could be used to improve it and 96% of
      coaches in schools without a plan indicated that the kit could be used to develop
      one. Most assessed the kit as visually appealing, easy to use, and containing
      appropriate content. There were no significant differences among coaches with
      differing professional experience or for sports with different injury rates.
      Among those with other concussion-prevention materials, most indicated greater
      satisfaction with the toolkit.

TI  - Effective prevention of sports injuries: a model integrating efficacy,
      efficiency, compliance and risk-taking behaviour.
PG  - 648-52
LID - 10.1136/bjsm.2008.046441 [doi]
AB  - In 1992 van Mechelen et al published a "sequence of prevention model" based on a 
      four-step process. This model has been widely used to implement preventive
      measures in response to sports injuries. However, the execution of this model has
      been shown to lack validity in determining the success of a preventive measure. A
      modified model has therefore been proposed which incorporates additional steps
      that enable the inclusion of external factors with a significant effect on the
      outcome of a prevention intervention. This expansion of van Mechelen's model
      leads to a more global model in which the compliance level and risk-taking
      behaviour of the individual and the assessment of efficiency of the stakeholders 
      have a key influence on the preventive measure. This model gives a better insight
      into the different processes in injury prevention that can be used by clinicians,
      coaches and managers to decide whether to implement a preventive measure
      programme.

LID - 10.1016/j.pmr.2007.12.003 [doi]
AB  - Injury rates are high among children and adolescent athletes. Psychosocial
      stressors, such as personality, history of stressors, and life event stress can
      influence injury occurrence. After injury, those same factors plus athletic
      identity, self-esteem, and significant others-such as parents, coaches, and
      teammates-can affect injury response, recovery and subsequent sport performance. 
      Goal setting, positive self-talk, attribution theory, and relaxation or mental
      imagery are psychologic interventions that can help injured athletes cope with
      psychosocial stressors. Medical professionals should be aware of the potential
      influence that psychosocial stressors and psychologic interventions can have on
      injury occurrence, injury recovery, and sport performance.

AB  - Children and adolescents with medical conditions present special issues with
      respect to participation in athletic activities. The pediatrician can play an
      important role in determining whether a child with a health condition should
      participate in certain sports by assessing the child's health status, suggesting 
      appropriate equipment or modifications of sports to decrease the risk of injury, 
      and educating the athlete, parent(s) or guardian, and coach regarding the risks
      of injury as they relate to the child's condition. This report updates a previous
      policy statement and provides information for pediatricians on sports
      participation for children and adolescents with medical conditions.

TI  - Exploring relations of wellness and athletic coping skills of collegiate
      athletes: implications for sport performance.
PG  - 1043-9
AB  - In exploring the relationship between wellness and athletic performance, this
      study assessed the link between wellness, as defined by a high score on five
      wellness dimensions of emotional, social, spiritual, intellectual, and physical
      well-being, with psychological variables thought to be related to athletic
      performance as measured by athletes' self-report of specific athletic coping
      skills. 142 collegiate athletes completed a survey composed of the Optimal Living
      Profile to measure wellness dimensions and the Athletic Coping Skills Inventory
      to measure specific psychological variables. Analysis indicated that athletes
      scoring higher on the dimensions of wellness also scored significantly higher on 
      athletic coping skills. Specifically, male athletes who scored higher on wellness
      also reported higher scores on coachability, concentration, goal setting/mental
      preparation, and peaking under pressure, and female athletes who scored higher on
      wellness also reported higher scores in coping with adversity, coachability,
      concentration, goal setting/mental preparation, and freedom from worry. Various
      dimensions of wellness seem related to better performance by involving the
      athletic coping skills of intercollegiate athletes. Implications for coaches and 
      sport psychologists are also discussed.

TI  - Gender, level of participation, and type of sport: differences in achievement
      goal orientation and attributional style.
PG  - 508-12
LID - 10.1016/j.jsams.2008.01.005 [doi]
AB  - Findings regarding gender differences in achievement goal orientations and
      attributional style have been somewhat inconsistent. One possible explanation for
      varied findings is that potentially confounding variables such as level of
      participation and type of sport have not been considered. Athletes (108 males and
      164 females) from team and individual sports, competing at recreational and
      competitive levels, completed the Task and Ego Orientation in Sport
      Questionnaire, the Sport Attributional Style Scale, and a demographic
      questionnaire. Athletes competing in individual sports had a higher ego
      orientation than those from team sports, and females scored higher in task
      orientation than males. Individual sport athletes made more internal, stable, and
      global, and less externally controllable attributions for positive events, and
      more internal attributions for negative events than team sport athletes.
      Competitive female athletes made less global attributions for positive events
      than did recreational female athletes. This difference was not observed in male
      athletes. Competitive individual, but not team, athletes made less global
      attributions than recreational individual athletes. The significant interactions 
      regarding globality suggest that the tradition in sport psychology attribution
      research to focus solely on internality, stability, and controllability may be
      inadequate. From an applied perspective, sport psychologists and coaches may find
      it beneficial to target individual sport athletes and males for interventions
      designed to enhance task orientation. Similarly, team sport athletes may be
      appropriate as a focus for attribution retraining programs.

TI  - Using sport to promote HIV/AIDS education for at-risk youths: an intervention
      using peer coaches in football.
PG  - 129-41
LID - 10.1111/j.1600-0838.2007.00744.x [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of an ongoing AIDS
      education intervention program (EMIMA) using peers in a sport context. A
      secondary purpose was to determine whether a mastery-based motivational strategy 
      would enhance the effectiveness of the peer coaches. A quasi field experimental
      study was employed in which at-risk children in Dar es Salaam in Tanzania (N=764)
      were recruited (average age=13.6 years) and were randomly grouped into two
      treatment groups and two control groups. The treatment groups were peer coaches
      conducting the AIDS education to the children within sport, one with mastery
      coaching strategies and one without. The two control groups were in-school
      children, who received traditional AIDS education, and out-of-school children,
      who received no education at all. The intervention lasted for 8 weeks. The
      results indicated that the intervention using peers in sport was more effective
      in transmitting HIV prevention knowledge, cognitions and perceived behaviors than
      the control groups. The mastery-based motivational strategies were effective in
      influencing some of the variables. Contrary to expectation, the school-based HIV 
      education was no more effective than the informal education obtained by the
      out-of-school children. The use of peer coaches within the EMIMA program was
      reliably the most effective means for HIV/AIDS education for these at-risk
      children.

      sports-related injuries are related to illegal activity?
PG  - 34-8
LID - 10.1136/ip.2007.017277 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare sport and gender differences in injury rates and
      proportions of injuries related to illegal activity and to describe the
      epidemiology of injuries related to illegal activity. DESIGN: Descriptive
      epidemiology study. SETTING: 100 US high schools. SUBJECTS: Athletes
      participating in nine sports: boys' football, soccer, basketball, wrestling, and 
      baseball plus girls' soccer, volleyball, basketball, and softball. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURES: Illegal activity-related injuries were analyzed using data from the
      2005-06 and 2006-07 National High School Sports-Related Injury Surveillance
      Study. RESULTS: Nationally, an estimated 98 066 injuries were directly related to
      an action that was ruled illegal activity by a referee/official or disciplinary
      committee, giving an injury rate of 0.24 injuries per 1000 athletic
      competition-exposures. Boys' and girls' soccer had the highest rates of injuries 
      related to illegal activity, and girls' volleyball, girls' softball, and boys'
      baseball had the lowest. Overall, 6.4% of all high school sports-related injuries
      were related to illegal activity, with the highest proportion in girls'
      basketball (14.0%), girls' soccer (11.9%), and boys' soccer (11.4%). A greater
      proportion of injuries related to illegal activity were to the head/face (32.3%) 
      and were concussions (25.4%) than injuries not related to illegal activity (13.8%
      (injury proportion ratio 2.35; 95% CI 1.82 to 3.04; p<0.001) and 10.9% (injury
      proportion ratio 2.35; 95% CI 1.71 to 3.22; p<0.001), respectively). CONCLUSIONS:
      Illegal activity is an overlooked risk factor for sports-related injury. Reducing
      illegal activity through enhanced enforcement of sports' rules and targeted
      education about the dangers of illegal activity for players, coaches, and
      referees/officials may reduce sports-related injuries.

TI  - The role of massage in sports performance and rehabilitation: current evidence
      and future direction.
PG  - 7-21
AB  - BACKGROUND: Massage is a popular treatment choice of athletes, coaches, and
      sports physical therapists. Despite its purported benefits and frequent use,
      evidence demonstrating its efficacy is scarce. PURPOSE: To identify current
      literature relating to sports massage and its role in effecting an athlete's
      psychological readiness, in enhancing sports performance, in recovery from
      exercise and competition, and in the treatment of sports related musculoskeletal 
      injuries. METHODS: Electronic databases were used to identify papers relevant to 
      this review. The following keywords were searched: massage, sports injuries,
      athletic injuries, physical therapy, rehabilitation, delayed onset muscle
      soreness, sports psychology, sports performance, sports massage, sports recovery,
      soft tissue mobilization, deep transverse friction massage, pre-event, and post
      exercise. RESULTS: RESEARCH STUDIES PERTAINING TO THE FOLLOWING GENERAL
      CATEGORIES WERE IDENTIFIED AND REVIEWED: pre-event (physiological and
      psychological variables), sports performance, recovery, and rehabilitation.
      DISCUSSION: Despite the fact clinical research has been performed, a poor
      appreciation exists for the appropriate clinical use of sports massage.
      CONCLUSION: Additional studies examining the physiological and psychological
      effects of sports massage are necessary in order to assist the sports physical
      therapist in developing and implementing clinically significant evidence based
      programs or treatments.

TI  - Supplements of interest for sport-related injury and sources of supplement
      information among college athletes.
PG  - 50-4
AB  - PURPOSE: This study examined incidence of sport-related injury, interest in
      supplements to treat injury, and sources of supplement information among 145
      college athletes (89 males, 56 females). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A survey was used
      to assess sport-related injuries, interest in three categories of supplements to 
      treat injury, and sources of supplement information among college athletes who
      used athletic training room and weight training facilities. Pearson chi2 was used
      to evaluate differences in frequency distribution of responses by sex. RESULTS:
      Sport-related injuries were experienced by 91% of athletes (93% males, 88%
      females). Overall, 17% of participants were interested in supplements to improve 
      circulation, 34% for joint and soft tissue repair, and 22% to reduce
      inflammation. Significant sex differences were not found for any supplements in
      any categories evaluated. Males were more likely than females to rely on strength
      coaches (37%, 20%) for supplement information. Athletic trainers (71% of
      athletes), coaches (60%), and physicians (41%) were the primary professionals,
      and the internet (79%), magazines (68%), and television (52%) the most popular
      sources of media for supplement information. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of
      athletes experience injury during their college athletic career and 17% to 34%
      express an interest in supplements for injury treatment. Athletes would benefit
      from scientifically sound guidance to identify appropriate supplements for injury
      treatment and internet sites for supplement information. Future research should
      identify if athletes are more likely to increase supplement use when they are
      injured or if supplement use is more prevalent among athletes who are prone to
      injury.

TI  - College athletes' perceptions of social support provided by their coach before
      injury and after it.
PG  - 107-12
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate athletes' perceptions of social
      support provided by their coach before injury and after it. METHODS: Participants
      were 29 high school athletes with minor to severe injuries, who were forced to
      sit out practice or competition for at least 3 days due to their injury. Male
      (n=17) and female (n=12) team sport and individual sport athletes ranged in age
      from 18 to 25 years (mean: 21.18; standard deviation: 1.26). Eight subjects (28%)
      had major injuries, 12 (41%) had moderate injuries, and 9 (29%) had minor
      injuries. Twenty-nine high school athletes completed a modified version of the
      Social Support Survey. Data were collected on who provides each of 6 types of
      social support, how satisfied the high school athletes are with the amount and
      type of support they received, and the perceived effect of support on their
      well-being. RESULTS: With two exceptions, results indicated no differences
      between preinjury and postinjury satisfaction with the support provided by
      coaches. The exceptions were for task challenge support and emotional challenge
      support. Results indicated no differences in the perceived importance to their
      well-being of support provided by coaches before injury and after it. The
      exceptions were for listening support and emotional support. CONCLUSION: These
      findings confirm the possible positive effects of coaches' listening and
      emotional support on injured high school athletes' recovery efforts.

TI  - What makes coaches tick? The impact of coaches' intrinsic and extrinsic motives
      on their own satisfaction and that of their athletes.
PG  - 664-73
LID - 10.1111/j.1600-0838.2007.00705.x [doi]
AB  - This study aims to investigate the influence of two types of motivational forces 
      on coach and athlete satisfaction. The focus is on intrinsic and extrinsic
      motives that initiate coach-related behavior. A questionnaire that measures both 
      types of motivation and three facets of satisfaction (i.e., satisfaction with
      performance, with instruction, and with the coach-athlete relationship) was
      completed by 138 coaches. One athlete from each of the coaches who participated
      in the study was also asked to complete a questionnaire that measures their
      satisfaction with performance, instruction, and the coach-athlete relationship.
      Results from a series of regression analyses indicated that while intrinsic
      motivation was moderately and positively related to all facets of coach
      satisfaction, extrinsic motivation was only related to coach satisfaction with
      the coach-athlete relationship. Athletes' satisfaction with the coach-athlete
      relationship was only associated with the coach's intrinsic motivation.
      Interaction effects among the two types of motivation were significant suggesting
      that extrinsic motivation can potentially undermine intrinsic motivation when
      intrinsic motivation is low. The findings are discussed based on assumptions put 
      forward by self-determination theory.

TI  - Prevention of traumatic dental lesions: cognitive research on the role of
      mouthguards during sport activities in paediatric age.
PG  - 193-8
AB  - AIM: This study reports a personal contribution and the analysis of the most
      recent literature on prevention of dentoalveolar traumas, and the lack of
      knowledge and use of protective oral devices in children (7-12 years old)
      practicing sports. Different oral protection devices will be illustrated, and
      among them the types more suitable for the investigated age group. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Recently we conducted a survey on a sample of 300 children between 8 and
      11 years of age practicing basketball, to assess the frequency of oral traumas,
      correlated predisposing factors, level of knowledge of mouthguards and possible
      frequency of use of such devices. RESULTS: From the survey it emerged that only
      30 subjects knew about mouthguards (15 of them received the information from
      their dentist) and none of them received information from the coach or within the
      sport club. Furthermore, only 3 subjects (1% of the sample) wore a mouthguard
      during practice. Our study and other literature contributions highlight the total
      lack of information of the practitioners, especially the young ones, and the
      unconcern for these problems by the organisations (clubs) where sports are
      practiced. A cycle of 2 brief conferences about orofacial trauma prevention and
      use of mouthguard was administered. Regarding the type of mouthguard more
      suitable to adolescent athletes, the semi-individual types of new generation seem
      to be the best choice, since they can be refitted multiple times in order to
      adapt to the dental and skeletal growth. Conclusion We can conclude reasserting
      the absolute need of providing information about the risks of orofacial trauma
      related with basketball and other contact sport activities, and to promote the
      use of mouthguards as a primary protective measure among athletes, which will
      considerably reduce the social costs associated with such trauma occurrences.

TI  - Goal striving, goal attainment, and well-being: adapting and testing the
      self-concordance model in sport.
PG  - 763-82
AB  - Grounded in self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985) and the
      self-concordance model (Sheldon & Elliot, 1999), this study examined the
      motivational processes underlying goal striving in sport as well as the role of
      perceived coach autonomy support in the goal process. Structural equation
      modeling with a sample of 210 British athletes showed that autonomous goal
      motives positively predicted effort, which, in turn, predicted goal attainment.
      Goal attainment was positively linked to need satisfaction, which, in turn,
      predicted psychological well-being. Effort and need satisfaction were found to
      mediate the associations between autonomous motives and goal attainment and
      between attainment and well-being, respectively. Controlled motives negatively
      predicted well-being, and coach autonomy support positively predicted both
      autonomous motives and need satisfaction. Associations of autonomous motives with
      effort were not reducible to goal difficulty, goal specificity, or goal efficacy.
      These findings support the self-concordance model as a framework for further
      research on goal setting in sport.

TI  - Predictors of poor sportspersonship in youth sports: personal attitudes and
      social influences.
PG  - 747-62
AB  - The present study examined personal and social correlates of poor
      sportspersonship among youth sport participants. Male and female athletes (n =
      676) in the fifth through eighth grades from three geographic regions of the U.S.
      participated in the study. Young athletes involved in basketball, soccer,
      football, hockey, baseball/ softball, or lacrosse completed a questionnaire that 
      tapped poor sportspersonship behaviors and attitudes, team sportspersonship
      norms, perceptions of the poor sportspersonship behaviors of coaches and
      spectators, and the sportspersonship norms of coaches and parents. Preliminary
      analyses revealed significant gender, grade, sport area, and location differences
      in self-reported unsportspersonlike behavior. The main analysis revealed that
      self-reported poor sport behaviors were best predicted by perceived coach and
      spectator behaviors, followed by team norms, sportspersonship attitudes, and the 
      perceived norms of parents and coaches. Results are discussed in relation to the 
      concept of moral atmosphere.

TI  - Effective speed and agility conditioning methodology for random intermittent
      dynamic type sports.
PG  - 1093-100
AB  - Different coaching methods are often used to improve performance. This study
      compared the effectiveness of 2 methodologies for speed and agility conditioning 
      for random, intermittent, and dynamic activity sports (e.g., soccer, tennis,
      hockey, basketball, rugby, and netball) and the necessity for specialized
      coaching equipment. Two groups were delivered either a programmed method (PC) or 
      a random method (RC) of conditioning with a third group receiving no conditioning
      (NC). PC participants used the speed, agility, quickness (SAQ) conditioning
      method, and RC participants played supervised small-sided soccer games. PC was
      also subdivided into 2 groups where participants either used specialized SAQ
      equipment or no equipment. A total of 46 (25 males and 21 females) untrained
      participants received (mean +/- SD) 12.2 +/- 2.1 hours of physical conditioning
      over 6 weeks between a battery of speed and agility parameter field tests.
      Two-way analysis of variance results indicated that both conditioning groups
      showed a significant decrease in body mass and body mass index, although PC
      achieved significantly greater improvements on acceleration, deceleration, leg
      power, dynamic balance, and the overall summation of % increases when compared to
      RC and NC (p < 0.05). PC in the form of SAQ exercises appears to be a superior
      method for improving speed and agility parameters; however, this study found that
      specialized SAQ equipment was not a requirement to observe significant
      improvements. Further research is required to establish whether these benefits
      transfer to sport-specific tasks as well as to the underlying mechanisms
      resulting in improved performance.

TI  - Neuropsychological evaluation in the diagnosis and management of sports-related
      concussion.
PG  - 909-16
AB  - A mild traumatic brain injury in sports is typically referred to as a concussion.
      This is a common injury in amateur and professional athletics, particularly in
      contact sports. This injury can be very distressing for the athlete, his or her
      family, coaches, and school personnel. Fortunately, most athletes recover quickly
      and fully from this injury. However, some athletes have a slow recovery, and
      there are reasons to be particularly concerned about re-injury during the acute
      recovery period. Moreover, some athletes who have experienced multiple
      concussions are at risk for long-term adverse effects. Neuropsychologists are
      uniquely qualified to assess the neurocognitive and psychological effects of
      concussion. The National Academy of Neuropsychology recommends neuropsychological
      evaluation for the diagnosis, treatment, and management of sports-related
      concussion at all levels of play.

TI  - From the sidelines: coaching as a nurse practitioner strategy for improving
      health outcomes.
PG  - 555-62
AB  - PURPOSE: The purposes of this study were to explore coaching as a nurse
      practitioner (NP) strategy for improving patient health outcomes and to lay a
      foundation for validating coaching benefits. DATA SOURCES: Review of coaching
      literature in psychology, sports, business, and nursing. CONCLUSIONS: Coaching
      has been reported as successful in psychology, sports, business, and more
      recently nursing, for assisting people to achieve goals that are important to
      them. Coaching may be very effective in encouraging, inspiring, and empowering
      patients to reach their maximum health potential, particularly if lifestyle
      change is required; however, coaching research is in its early stages. Coaching
      is not well defined, so claims of coaching benefits must be viewed cautiously.
      Coaching is an expected NP role competency, but it is not well explicated in the 
      literature. Defining the concept of coaching from multidisciplinary consensus,
      expanding knowledge of the coaching process, and consciously implementing
      coaching communication in the NP/patient primary care encounter may result in
      measurable outcomes that demonstrate coaching effectiveness. IMPLICATIONS FOR
      PRACTICE: Coaching fits well with the holistic, collaborative approach to patient
      care which NPs value. Coaching provides an opportunity to shift traditional
      thinking about patient/provider relationships and how to motivate patients toward
      behavior change. The challenge for NPs is to take the time to learn the coaching 
      process, employ coaching communication strategies in the primary care encounter, 
      and engage in research that measures coaching effectiveness.

TI  - [Psychometric evaluation of the Coach Orientation Questionnaire with a Spanish
      sample of handball coaches].
PG  - 699-705
AB  - The purpose of this study was to develop a questionnaire to investigate
      volleyball coaches' orientations toward the coaching process. The study was
      preceded by four developmental stages in order to improve user understanding,
      validate the content, and refine the psychometric properties of the instrument.
      Participants for the reliability and validity study were 334 Spanish volleyball
      team coaches, 86.5% men and 13.2% women. The following 6 factors emerged from the
      exploratory factor analysis: team-work orientation, technological orientation,
      innovative orientation, dialogue orientation, directive orientation, and social
      climate orientation. Statistical results indicated that the instrument produced
      reliable and valid scores in all the obtained factors (a> .70), showing that this
      questionnaire is a useful tool to examine coaches' orientations towards coaching.

TI  - [The influence of psychological variables on sports performance: assessment with 
      the Questionnaire of Sports Performance-related Psychological Characteristics].
PG  - 667-72
AB  - The purpose of this research was to observe the relationship among psychological 
      variables and three important issues in sports competition: achieving success,
      long-term continuance and sustaining injuries. Three studies were carried out
      with three groups of athletes from the areas of judo, football and swimming,
      using the Questionnaire of Sports Performance-related Psychological
      Characteristics as the measuring instrument. The analyses carried out revealed
      significantly statistical associations between the perception of stress control
      and of self-confidence, and between achieving success, long-term continuance in
      competition sports and sustaining injuries. These results indicate the importance
      of psychological skills training to aid sports performance and prevent injuries, 
      as well as the use of the above-mentioned questionnaire, which, with a limited
      number of items, measures a wide range of psychological variables in the specific
      context of sports.

TI  - Gay and lesbian coaches' teams: differences in liking by male and female former
      sport participants.
PG  - 270-2
AB  - Previous literature suggests that men, more than women, both adhere to
      traditional gender beliefs and evaluate violators more harshly. Thus, within the 
      heteronormative sport environment it was hypothesized that men's liking of a team
      coached by a gay or lesbian may be influenced more than women's liking.
      Respondents were college-age men (n=130) and women (n=98), former sport
      participants. Multivariate analysis of covariance (controlling for the presence
      of gay and lesbian friends and acquaintances) supported the hypothesis. Findings 
      are discussed in terms of sports' heterosexual environment, adherence to
      gender-role norms, and motivational sexual prejudice.

TI  - Coaches' encouragement of athletes' imagery use.
PG  - 351-63
AB  - To investigate whether coaches encourage their athletes to use imagery, two
      studies were undertaken. In the first, 317 athletes completed the Coaches'
      Encouragement of Athletes' Imagery Use Questionnaire. In the second, 215 coaches 
      completed a slightly modified version of this questionnaire. It was found that
      coaches and athletes generally agreed on the relative frequency with which
      coaches encourage athletes to use imagery across the 4 Ws (i.e., where, when,
      why, and what). Coaches promoted imagery use more in conjunction with competition
      than training and injury rehabilitation, and higher-level coaches encouraged
      imagery use far more than their recreational counterparts. In addition, the level
      of athlete being coached had a major impact on how much or little coaches
      encouraged their athletes to use imagery. Coaches encouraged higher level
      athletes (i.e., international, national, varsity) to use imagery more than club
      and recreational athletes.

TI  - Development and initial psychometric evaluation of the sport interference
      checklist.
PG  - 937-57
AB  - The Sport Interference Checklist (SIC) was developed in 141 athletes to assist in
      the concurrent assessment of cognitive and behavioral problems experienced by
      athletes in both training (Problems in Sports Training Scale, PSTS) and
      competition (Problems in Sports Competition Scale, PSCS). An additional scale
      (Desire for Sport Psychology Scale, DSPS) was developed to assess the degree to
      which athletes desire sport psychology assistance in areas that are determined to
      be problematic. Factor analysis of PSCS items reveals six factors (Dysfunctional 
      Thoughts and Stress, Academic and Adjustment Problems, Injury Concerns, Lack of
      Motivation, Overly Confident/Critical, Pain Intolerance), accounting for 64% of
      the total variance. PSTS and DSPS items yield four factors (Dysfunctional
      Thoughts and Stress, Academic Problems, Injury Concerns, Poor Team
      Relationships), accounting for 59% and 63% of total variance, respectively.
      Scores from these scales demonstrate acceptable internal consistency and
      convergent and discriminative validity. Response patterns of SIC scales are not
      influenced by gender or athlete type.

TI  - Intermediaries supporting sports-based youth development programs.
PG  - 107-18, 10-1
AB  - The authors describe intermediary organizations whose aim is to provide technical
      assistance to sports organizations about infusing a youth development emphasis
      into their programming. Team-Up for Youth, Sports PLUS Global, and the National
      Recreation and Park Association are the three organizations highlighted in this
      article. Team-Up for Youth's mission is to pioneer innovative strategies to
      support the healthy development of youth by strengthening and expanding
      afterschool sports and physical activity programs. Team-Up works with youth
      sports providers, policymakers and public officials, and staff and students at
      colleges and universities in the San Francisco Bay Area. It concentrates on five 
      areas: training and education, coaching corps, grant making, public policy, and
      knowledge creating and sharing. Sports PLUS Global is an international
      organization that delivers educational training to communities using sports to
      promote human development, social change, and human rights. It uses the Positive 
      Learning Using Sports (PLUS) method to reach children, coaches, and educators in 
      camps and afterschool programs. The PLUS method employs twelve steps that are
      described in detail in the article. The National Recreation and Park Association 
      (NRPA) engages national partners and local park and recreation agencies to
      improve the quality of youth sports nationwide. NRPA, in partnership with Sports 
      Illustrated magazine, developed and manages the Sports Illustrated GOOD SPORTS
      initiative. Communities are improving youth sports through the following
      elements: teaching life skills, empowering success among youth, promoting
      physical activity and healthy lifestyles, and strengthening communities.

TI  - Characteristics of sports-based youth development programs.
PG  - 75-84, 8-9
AB  - The term "sports-based youth development programs" is coined and defined in the
      context of the community youth development framework. Sports-based youth
      development programs are out-of-school-time programs that use a particular sport 
      to facilitate learning and life skill development in youth. Community youth
      development programs use a community youth development approach to create
      opportunities for youth to connect to others, develop skills, and use those
      skills to contribute to their communities. This, in turn, increases their ability
      to succeed. The authors describe how sports-based youth development programs can 
      be contexts that promote positive youth development. The features of positive
      developmental settings for youth from the work of the National Research Council
      and the Institute of Medicine, as well as the features identified by other
      researchers, are presented in the context of sports-based youth development
      programs. For example, a sports program that provides appropriate structure has
      delineated clear rules, expectations, and responsibilities for youth, parents,
      coaches, officials, and other organizers.

TI  - Improving health through youth sports: is participation enough?
PG  - 27-41, 6
AB  - The health benefits of engaging in regular physical activity are widely known:
      enhanced cardiorespiratory fitness, increased muscular strength and endurance,
      and favorable cholesterol and other profiles. Nevertheless, particularly in youth
      sports programs run by volunteer, and perhaps inadequately trained, coaches, many
      youth may not realize the health benefits of sports participation due to a number
      of factors, among them, inappropriate coach-child ratios, limited space, or
      mismatched expectations between coaches and those of children and their parents. 
      There are specific strategies that can be implemented to ensure that youth
      receive the maximize benefits from participation in sports. These strategies are 
      presented in the following areas: frequency, intensity, and duration;
      cross-training or complementary exercise; access points; utilization of space and
      time; nutrition; and rest. For instance, with regard to the frequency of physical
      activity, some sports, including soccer, basketball, and singles tennis, require 
      extensive physical effort over an extended period of time, while others, such as 
      baseball and football, have a lot of downtime. Thus, in order for children and
      youth to meet the recommendation of participating in moderate or vigorous
      physical activity at least four times per week, sports programs need to have
      opportunities for all athletes to practice hard. Finally, the author discusses
      the point at which participation in sports might be too much, leading to
      significant injuries, frustration, and resentment.

TI  - The effects of explanatory style on concussion outcomes in sport.
PG  - 161-7
AB  - Individuals with an optimistic explanatory style have generally been linked with 
      improved mental and physical health across a variety of chronic and serious
      conditions. The purpose of the current study was to examine the effects of
      explanatory style on recovery time and number of sport-related concussions
      suffered in the last 12 months. University varsity athletes (n=170) suffering
      from at least one concussion over the last 12 months from six contact or
      collision team sports completed both the Attributional Style Questionnaire and
      the Sport History Questionnaire. The results indicated that athletes with an
      optimistic explanatory style took longer to recover than athletes with a
      pessimistic or average explanatory style. More specifically, optimistic athletes 
      who suffered a complex concussion (requiring more than 7 days to recover) took
      significantly longer to return to play. However, the results showed that
      explanatory style did not influence whether an athlete suffered subsequent
      concussions. Overall, the current results can be used to better understand the
      psychology of concussions, as well as concussion prevention efforts and
      management strategies.

TI  - American College of Sports Medicine position stand. The female athlete triad.
PG  - 1867-82
AB  - The female athlete triad (Triad) refers to the interrelationships among energy
      availability, menstrual function, and bone mineral density, which may have
      clinical manifestations including eating disorders, functional hypothalamic
      amenorrhea, and osteoporosis. With proper nutrition, these same relationships
      promote robust health. Athletes are distributed along a spectrum between health
      and disease, and those at the pathological end may not exhibit all these clinical
      conditions simultaneously. Energy availability is defined as dietary energy
      intake minus exercise energy expenditure. Low energy availability appears to be
      the factor that impairs reproductive and skeletal health in the Triad, and it may
      be inadvertent, intentional, or psychopathological. Most effects appear to occur 
      below an energy availability of 30 kcal.kg(-1) of fat-free mass per day.
      Restrictive eating behaviors practiced by girls and women in sports or physical
      activities that emphasize leanness are of special concern. For prevention and
      early intervention, education of athletes, parents, coaches, trainers, judges,
      and administrators is a priority. Athletes should be assessed for the Triad at
      the preparticipation physical and/or annual health screening exam, and whenever
      an athlete presents with any of the Triad's clinical conditions. Sport
      administrators should also consider rule changes to discourage unhealthy weight
      loss practices. A multidisciplinary treatment team should include a physician or 
      other health-care professional, a registered dietitian, and, for athletes with
      eating disorders, a mental health practitioner. Additional valuable team members 
      may include a certified athletic trainer, an exercise physiologist, and the
      athlete's coach, parents and other family members. The first aim of treatment for
      any Triad component is to increase energy availability by increasing energy
      intake and/or reducing exercise energy expenditure. Nutrition counseling and
      monitoring are sufficient interventions for many athletes, but eating disorders

      athletes with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea.

TI  - Quality of life and sports activities in patients with haemophilia.
PG  - 38-43
AB  - Quality of life (QoL) is a multidimensional construct pertaining to an
      individual's physical, emotional, mental, social and behavioural components of
      well-being and functioning. QoL can be assessed using both generic and
      disease-specific instruments. QoL assessment in haemophilia is a relatively new
      area of study; the first data were published in 1990 using generic QoL
      questionnaires. Only recently have haemophilia-specific questionnaires been
      developed, first for children and then for adults. Because sports activities
      include not only physical and functional aspects, but also have an impact on an
      individual's self-esteem and social interactions, they should play an essential
      role in QoL assessment. Until the 1970s, persons with haemophilia were advised to
      avoid any kind of physical activity because of the risk of bleeds. Nowadays,
      however, the attitude towards sports for patients with haemophilia has changed,
      and the World Federation of Haemophilia has formulated recommendations concerning
      physical activities for patients with haemophilia. Although sports activities are
      recommended, their importance as an integral element in haemophilia management
      has not yet been widely recognized. Awareness of the importance of sports
      activities for this patient group has increased, and several sports projects are 
      ongoing. For example, a twice-annual sports camp for adult patients has been held
      in Germany for the past 2 years; and physical improvements, QoL and subjective
      training effects are being measured. Another study is investigating the
      prevalence of sports activities in Italian children with haemophilia and their
      attitudes towards sports and is also assessing QoL. In Israel, a study is planned
      in which haemophilic children will participate in a karate training programme,
      and a QoL evaluation will be added to the physical assessment. In conclusion,
      sports activities can improve not only physical well-being, but also the
      emotional and social well-being of persons with haemophilia and, therefore,
      should become part of the global approach to haemophilia management.

TI  - Australian chiropractic sports medicine: half way there or living on a prayer?
PG  - 14
AB  - Sports chiropractic within Australia has a chequered historical background of
      unorthodox individualistic displays of egocentric treatment approaches that
      emphasise specific technique preference and individual prowess rather than
      standardised evidence based management. This situation has changed in recent
      years with the acceptance of many within sports chiropractic to operate under an 
      evidence informed banner and to embrace a research culture. Despite recent
      developments within the sports chiropractic movement, the profession is still
      plagued by a minority of practitioners continuing to espouse certain marginal and
      outlandish technique systems that beleaguer the mainstream core of sports
      chiropractic as a cohesive and homogeneous group. Modern chiropractic management 
      is frequently multimodal in nature and incorporates components of passive and
      active care. Such management typically incorporates spinal and peripheral
      manipulation, mobilisation, soft tissue techniques, rehabilitation and
      therapeutic exercises. Externally, sports chiropractic has faced hurdles too,
      with a lack of recognition and acceptance by organized and orthodox sports
      medical groups. Whilst some arguments against the inclusion of chiropractic may
      be legitimate due to its historical baggage, much of the argument appears to be
      anti-competitive, insecure and driven by a closed-shop mentality.sequently,
      chiropractic as a profession still remains a pariah to the organised sports
      medicine world. Add to this an uncertain continuing education system, a lack of
      protection for the title 'sports chiropractor', a lack of a recognized specialist
      status and a lack of support from traditional chiropractic, the challenges for
      the growth and acceptance of the sports chiropractor are considerable. This
      article outlines the historical and current challenges, both internal and
      external, faced by sports chiropractic within Australia and proposes positive
      changes that will assist in recognition and inclusion of sports chiropractic in
      both chiropractic and multi-disciplinary sports medicine alike.

TI  - Perceptions of elite coaches and sports scientists of the research needs for
      elite coaching practice.
PG  - 1577-86
AB  - A major objective of sports scientists and elite coaches is the enhancement of
      athletic performance. Despite this common goal, there is a general perception
      that research in sports science does not meet the needs of coaches. A study using
      survey and interview examined the perceptions of elite coaches and sports science
      researchers in Australia regarding the research needs of elite coaching.
      Congruence was found between coaches and researchers regarding research practice 
      at the elite level. Both groups held common perceptions on the importance and
      application of research, the methods by which research questions are determined, 
      and the qualities valued in elite coaches and sports science researchers.
      However, elite coaches perceived a need for more research in the area of sports
      psychology, dissemination of research findings via coaching clinics and
      sports-specific magazines, and the use of more appropriate "lay" language in
      information dissemination.

TI  - Molecular diagnosis of certain nematode infections can save life and beauty, and 
      preserve breeds of socially relevant and sporting animals.
PG  - 1-5
AB  - The recognition that the health and welfare of some humans are improved through
      contact and relationships with animals is now established. Two commonly
      recognized assistance animals are dogs and horses. Both provide therapeutic
      benefits to humans with some physical and mental illnesses and both assist people
      with disabilities. Moreover, the public and scientific attention to the health
      and conservation of many animal breeds is also increasing worldwide. In the past 
      few years, two potentially life-threatening nematode infections that can induce
      tumours or tumour-like masses in canids and equids, spirocercosis and
      draschiosis/habronemosis, respectively, are emerging in several areas of the
      world. This article reviews and comments how recent insights into the molecular
      early diagnosis of these diseases can save and preserve life, beauty and breeds
      of socially relevant and sporting animals.

AB  - This study examined the relationship between organizational support, work-family 
      conflict, and job and life satisfaction among coaches. Data from collegiate head 
      coaches with families (N = 253) were gathered through a mailed questionnaire.
      Results from a series of covariance structure models indicated that a partially
      mediated model was the best fitting model, chi2 = (255, N = 253) 461.20, p <.
      001; root mean error of approximation = . 05; comparative fit index = .95;
      parsimonious normed fit index = .71. In partial support of the study hypotheses, 
      the results supported full mediation of the direct effect from organizational
      support to life satisfaction. Work-family conflict partially mediated the
      relationship between organizational support and job satisfaction. Job
      satisfaction partially mediated the effect of organizational support and
      work-family conflict to life satisfaction.

AB  - Several studies performed over the last 20 years have revealed an appreciable
      decrease in the average time spent daily on physical activity by children and
      adolescents in Europe. On the other hand, sports and physical activity improve
      not only motor ability and coordination, but also impact positively on cognitive 
      performance and mental health, and also reduce cardiovascular risks. Relevant
      associations agree that children should spend an hour a day indulging in moderate
      to higher-level physical activity. Daily periods of inactivity should be limited 
      to fewer than two hours. Measures aimed at improving mobility should be made
      available in kindergartens, schools and universities.

TI  - [Pharmacological approach to desychronization of the sleep-wakefulness cycle in
      the military and sport environment].
PG  - 258-64
AB  - Sports and military environments have many common features - intense physical
      activity, rigorous physical environment (heat, cold, high or low pressure,
      hypoxia, acceleration...), specific psychosocial atmosphere, team spirit. If
      combined with jet lag syndrome, these specific conditions can favor altered
      physical and mental performance. There is always the temptation to use drugs as a
      simple way to reduce the penalizing effects. The available compounds known to
      affect sleep and wakefulness include hypnotics, benzodiazepines and non
      benzodiazepines such as temazepam, zolopidem, and zopiclone, stimulants such as
      amphetamine and amphetamine-like agents, adrafinil, modafinil, caffeine and
      chronobiotics substances such as melatonin and, more recently, slow release
      caffeine. In the sports area, all of these substances except caffeine are on the 
      list of forbidden products, although special authorizations linked to known
      disease conditions are allowed. In the military setting, the environment may be
      similar, but the context of use is very different. In the context of a rescue
      mission, the current practice in the French military organization is to place
      modafinil pills in the ejection seat of fight planes and in rescue boats. A
      second context is the use of anti-sleep agents under orders; the debate continues
      on this and the appropriate recommendations in this context. Self-medication is a
      third condition, in which case no rules have been defined.

TI  - A review of epidemiology of paediatric elbow injuries in sports.
PG  - 717-35
AB  - The elbow is a common site of orthopaedic injury in the paediatric population.
      The number of these injuries continues to rise following increased levels of
      participation in paediatric recreational and competitive sport. Injuries to the
      paediatric elbow can be classified as either overuse or acute. Delineating injury
      patterns to the elbow in children can be challenging, given the cartilaginous
      composition of the distal humerus and the multiple secondary ossification centres
      that appear and unite with the epiphysis at defined ages. Pitching in baseball,
      serving in tennis, spiking in volleyball, passing in American football and
      launching in javelin-throwing can all produce elbow pathology by forceful valgus 
      stress, with medial stretching, lateral compression and posterior impingement. In
      children and adolescents, the epiphyseal plate is weaker than the surrounding
      ligaments, predisposing them to epiphyseal plate injuries. On the other hand,
      post-pubescent or skeletally mature athletes are more prone to tendinous or
      ligamentous injury. Injuries may cause significant impact on the athlete, parents
      and healthcare system. With the exception of baseball, there are few prospective 
      cohort studies on the epidemiological trends of childhood elbow injuries in other
      sports. This paper aims to describe the epidemiological trends in paediatric
      elbow injuries related to sports, suggests prevention strategies and discusses
      the scope for further research. A web-based search of existing articles
      pertaining to paediatric elbow injuries in sports was performed. The implications
      of acute and overuse injuries and the possibility of permanent damage should be
      understood by parents, coaches and the athletes. Proper understanding of the
      intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors that could lead to elbow injuries is thus
      required. Measures to prevent elbow injuries should include proper coaching,
      warm-up, officiation, legislation, medical expertise and protective gear. There
      are still many opportunities for prospective studies and other research projects 
      among young athletes in various sports. Current studies will serve as a baseline 
      for future research to assess the success of specific interventions in reducing
      the incidence of elbow injury in the paediatric athlete. Further epidemiological 
      studies in various sports will help expand our knowledge and prevent potential
      disability and deformity in the paediatric elbow.

TI  - A survey of sports medicine physicians regarding psychological issues in
      patient-athletes.
PG  - 2140-7
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the extent to which sports medicine physicians encounter
      and discuss psychological issues among athletes they treat and to evaluate
      physicians' perceptions of the availability and efficacy of sport psychologists
      and other mental health resources. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: 
      A survey was sent via e-mail to all physician members of 4 prominent sports
      medicine professional associations: the American Orthopaedic Society for Sports
      Medicine, American College of Sports Medicine, American Medical Society for
      Sports Medicine, and American Osteopathic Academy of Sports Medicine. RESULTS:
      The extent to which respondents discuss psychological issues with athletes varied
      by subspecialty and by specific issues assessed. Fears about reinjury, fears
      related to surgery, and lack of patience with recovery/rehabilitation were the 3 
      most common injury-related topics discussed with patient-athletes. The 3 most
      common non-injury-related topics discussed were stress/pressure, anxiety, and
      burnout. Family practitioners were more likely to discuss injury-related
      psychological issues than were orthopaedic surgeons. Orthopaedic surgeons
      reported the lowest frequencies of discussing non-injury-related psychological
      issues. Only 19% of all respondents indicated there were adequate numbers of
      sport psychologists and other mental health professionals in their geographical
      area to treat the needs of athletes. Three quarters of respondents reported they 
      rarely or never referred athletes to sport psychologists for injury-related
      issues, and two thirds indicated they rarely or never referred athletes to sport 
      psychologists for non-injury-related problems. Respondents rated sport
      psychologists and athletic trainers/physical therapists to be moderately
      effective in working with athletes regarding psychological problems. CONCLUSION: 
      Sports medicine physicians frequently encounter psychological issues with
      patient-athletes. There is a need for tools to facilitate assessment of these
      problems as well as greater communication between the mental health community and
      sports medicine physicians. In addition, knowledge of and access to professionals
      who are specifically trained to deal with the sometimes unique psychological
      needs of athletes should be improved.

TI  - Sporting achievement: what is the contribution of digit ratio?
PG  - 663-77
AB  - Second-to-fourth digit ratio, a marker for prenatal testosterone levels, has been
      shown to be associated with sporting achievement in men. It is unclear, however, 
      whether digit ratio makes a contribution over and above salient personality
      variables. The present study, which included female participants, measured four
      personality traits and one cognitive ability (mental rotation) that have been
      linked to both sports achievement and sex. The significant relationship between
      digit ratio and sporting achievement was nearly identical in women and men. A
      multiple regression showed that when significant correlates of sporting ability
      (weight, height, years playing, hours per week training, social potency, and
      mental rotation) were entered first, the contribution of digit ratio remained
      highly significant. We suggest that physiological as well as psychological
      factors may be an important avenue for future study.

TI  - Internal and external imagery perspective measurement and use in imagining open
      and closed sports skills: an exploratory study.
PG  - 387-404
AB  - This study explored the measurement and use of internal and external imagery
      perspectives during imagery of open and closed sports skills. Participants (N=41;
      male=23; female=18), ages 14 to 28 (M = 19.4 yr.; SD = 3.1), who were recruited
      from undergraduate classes in human movement and physical education, and local
      sporting teams, completed the Imagery Use Questionnaire and then imagined
      performing eight common sports skills, four open skills and four closed skills,
      in a random order. Participants provided concurrent verbalisation during their
      imagery. Immediately after imagining each skill, participants completed a rating 
      scale and retrospective verbalisation of imagery perspective use. Analysis
      indicated that the questionnaire gave a general imagery perspective preference
      but was not a strong predictor of imagery used on specific occasions. The three
      measures of imagery perspective were equivalent in imagining performing
      particular skills. Participants experienced more internal imagery than external
      imagery while imagining the eight sports skills, but there was no significant
      difference between perspective use on the open and closed skills.

TI  - Effects of a motivational climate inntervention for coaches on young athletes'
      sport performance anxiety.
PG  - 39-59
AB  - The mastery approach to coaching is a cognitive-behavioral intervention designed 
      to promote a mastery-involving motivational climate, shown in previous research
      to be related to lower anxiety in athletes. We tested the effects of this
      intervention on motivational climate and on changes in male and female
      athletes'cognitive and somatic performance anxiety over the course of a
      basketball season. Hierarchical linear modeling analyses revealed that the
      athletes in the intervention condition perceived their coaches as being more
      mastery-involving on the Motivational Climate Scale for Youth Sports when
      compared to athletes in an untreated control condition. Relative to athletes who 
      played for untrained coaches, those who played for the trained coaches exhibited 
      decreases on all subscales of the Sport Anxiety Scale-2 and on total anxiety
      score from preseason to late season. Control group athletes reported increases in
      anxiety over the season. The intervention had equally positive effects on boys
      and girls teams.

TI  - Qualitative biomechanical principles for application in coaching.
PG  - 109-18
AB  - Many aspects of human movements in sport can be readily understood by Newtonian
      rigid-body mechanics. Many of these laws and biomechanical principles, however,
      are counterintuitive to a lot of people. There are also several problems in the
      application of biomechanics to sports, so the application of biomechanics in the 
      qualitative analysis of sport skills by many coaches has been limited.
      Biomechanics scholars have long been interested in developing principles that
      facilitate the qualitative application of biomechanics to improve movement
      performance and reduce the risk of injury. This paper summarizes the major North 
      American efforts to establish a set of general biomechanical principles of
      movement, and illustrates how principles can be used to improve the application
      of biomechanics in the qualitative analysis of sport technique. A coach helping a
      player with a tennis serve is presented as an example. The standardization of
      terminology for biomechanical principles is proposed as an important first step
      in improving the application ofbiomechanics in sport. There is also a need for
      international cooperation and research on the effectiveness of applying
      biomechanical principles in the coaching of sport techniques.

TI  - Sport commitment among competitive female gymnasts: a developmental perspective.
PG  - 90-102
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine age and competitive level differences in
      the relationship between determinants and level of sport commitment. Gymnasts (N 
      = 304) comprised three age groups (8-11, 11-14.5, and 14.5-18 years) and two
      competitive levels (Levels 5-6 and 8-10). Multiple regression analyses revealed: 
      (a) perceived costs and social constraints from parents and best friends were the
      strongest predictors of commitment for the youngest gymnasts, (b) perceived
      costs, personal investments, and parent social constraints predicted commitment
      for 11-14.5-year-old gymnasts, and (c) perceived competence and costs predicted
      commitment for the oldest gymnasts. Competitive level differences also emerged;
      for Level 5-6 gymnasts, personal investments, perceived costs, coach social
      support, and social constraints by coach, best friend, and teammates were
      predictors of commitment. Personal investments and teammate social constraints
      were significant predictors for Level 8-10 gymnasts. Developmental factors and
      additional determinants are important to consider in further studies of the sport
      commitment model.

TI  - [Factors conditioning taking up sport activity by disabled people].
PG  - 864-9
AB  - The aim of the study was to answer the following questions: What factors
      determine that disabled people take up systematic sport activity or should make
      such a decision? What reasons are able to eliminate the handicapped from process 
      of regular going in for sport? Three groups of men participated. The group of
      disabled sportsmen included 39 subjects, the group of non-active disabled people 
      36 subjects and the group of able-bodied students 45 subjects. All the involved
      people answered the questions of the questionnaire, which concerned factors
      associated with sport activity of the handicapped and their socio-demographic
      characteristics, among other things. The opportunity of improvement of the health
      status is the main advantage of the sport for disabled people (53%). The chance
      of self-testing and sport competition was pointed out by 47% of subjects. The
      most common reason for taking up sport activity was sport passion (over 50%). The
      others were: possibility of creating new contacts with people, improvement of the
      physical condition, chance of self-testing and passing free time (23%). The lack 
      of free time was the factor eliminating from sport activity in the second group
      (28%). The other problem was the shortage of appropriate clubs, equipment,
      infrastructure etc. (almost 25%). Students concluded that sport for disabled
      people aims to improve the mental condition mainly (42%). Quite similar
      percentage of the group (38%) didn't see any reason that was able to exclude the 
      handicapped from goingin for sport. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Not only does active going
      in for sport improve the physical condition of the handicapped but strengthen
      them psychically as well. (2) The lack of sport activity in disabled people is to
      a high degree a result of low number of sport clubs, organisations, buildings as 
      well as presence of architectural barriers.

TI  - American College of Sports Medicine position stand. Exertional heat illness
      during training and competition.
PG  - 556-72
AB  - Exertional heat illness can affect athletes during high-intensity or
      long-duration exercise and result in withdrawal from activity or collapse during 
      or soon after activity. These maladies include exercise associated muscle
      cramping, heat exhaustion, or exertional heatstroke. While certain individuals
      are more prone to collapse from exhaustion in the heat (i.e., not acclimatized,
      using certain medications, dehydrated, or recently ill), exertional heatstroke
      (EHS) can affect seemingly healthy athletes even when the environment is
      relatively cool. EHS is defined as a rectal temperature greater than 40 degrees C
      accompanied by symptoms or signs of organ system failure, most frequently central
      nervous system dysfunction. Early recognition and rapid cooling can reduce both
      the morbidity and mortality associated with EHS. The clinical changes associated 
      with EHS can be subtle and easy to miss if coaches, medical personnel, and
      athletes do not maintain a high level of awareness and monitor at-risk athletes
      closely. Fatigue and exhaustion during exercise occur more rapidly as heat stress
      increases and are the most common causes of withdrawal from activity in hot
      conditions. When athletes collapse from exhaustion in hot conditions, the term
      heat exhaustion is often applied. In some cases, rectal temperature is the only
      discernable difference between severe heat exhaustion and EHS in on-site
      evaluations. Heat exhaustion will generally resolve with symptomatic care and
      oral fluid support. Exercise associated muscle cramping can occur with exhaustive
      work in any temperature range, but appears to be more prevalent in hot and humid 
      conditions. Muscle cramping usually responds to rest and replacement of fluid and
      salt (sodium). Prevention strategies are essential to reducing the incidence of
      EHS, heat exhaustion, and exercise associated muscle cramping.

TI  - Sport-related concussion misunderstandings among youth coaches.
PG  - 140-2
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the understanding of sport-related concussion among youth
      sports coaches. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: The survey was
      administered at coaches' meetings, following practices, and via mail.
      PARTICIPANTS: 156 active youth sports coaches, with 5.88 +/- 3.16 years (range
      1-22) of coaching experience. INTERVENTIONS: An original survey instrument
      developed to assess concussion knowledge. Internal validity of the instrument was
      established prior to the study (Cronbach's alpha = 0.83). MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASUREMENTS: Scores on the survey instrument reflecting symptom recognition and 
      management knowledge. RESULTS: For the 16 items comprising the symptom
      recognition survey, the mean number of correct responses was 9.78 +/- 2.07.
      Previous coaching education was predictive of better symptom recognition. On the 
      true/false portion, between 49.4% and 61.5% of coaches correctly answered the 4
      statements. CONCLUSION: This investigation revealed that, among youth sports
      coaches, coaching education was predictive of the ability to recognize signs and 
      symptoms of sport-related concussion. However, several misconceptions about
      concussion still exist, highlighting that education regarding concussion is
      necessary. The presence of qualified health care personnel, such as an athletic
      trainer, at the youth organization level may enhance early recognition,
      treatment, and referral of concussions.

TI  - Priorities for reducing the burden of injuries in sport: the example of
      Australian football.
PG  - 273-6
AB  - The promotion of safe sports participation has become a public health issue due
      to rising obesity rates and the potential for parental concerns about safety to
      inhibit sports participation. The safety of Australian football and its elite
      game, the Australian Football League (AFL), is often the focus of media
      commentary. Participation in the modified version of the game (Auskick) has been 
      shown to be safer but by the time children reach the under-15 age group, adult
      rules are in place and the umbrella of safety provided by modified rules is gone.
      Figures released recently by the AFL suggest that injury rates at the elite-level
      are at an historical low, but equivalent information for the more than 400,000
      non-elite participants is not available. Published literature related to
      preventing injuries in Australian football highlights a significant knowledge gap
      with respect to the aetiology of injuries in non-elite participants and only a
      very small evidence base for prevention of injuries in this sport. Gains in
      reducing the public health impact of football injuries, and injury-related
      barriers to Australian football participation, will only come from substantial
      investment in large-scale trials at the non-elite level, and a co-ordinated and
      multidisciplinary approach to dealing with safety and injury issues across all
      levels of play. Active and committed collaboration of key stakeholders such as
      government health agencies, peak sports bodies, sports administrators,
      clinicians, researchers, clubs, coaches and the participants themselves will be
      necessary.

TI  - The best of the best discourse on health: poetic insights on how professional
      sport socializes a family of men into hegemonic masculinity and physical
      inactivity.
PG  - 44-59
LID - 10.1177/1557988306294604 [doi]
AB  - This study examines how 4 men from the same family, representing different
      generations, construct health from their perceptions of professional athletes.
      Many men are socialized and participate in sport discourses that promote certain 
      truths about being a man that often have detrimental effects to their health. The
      capacity of research to inform men's construction of health is limited. In an
      attempt to engage male participants within the research process and cause a form 
      of catalytic validity, transcripts from interviews with the men were analyzed,
      and thematic findings were represented in a poetic form and shared with the
      participants for discussion and refinement. The findings revealed how the male
      participants reiterated messages that the media promotes, such as the importance 
      of physical and mental strength for a man. More significantly, the men became
      aware that they assumed a narrow definition of health portrayed by professional
      athletics that perpetuated a hegemonic masculinity. Reflections on changes in the
      men's lifestyle choices after engaging in the research process are offered in the
      conclusion.

TI  - Participation in weight-related sports is associated with higher use of
      unhealthful weight-control behaviors and steroid use.
PG  - 434-40
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether adolescents who participate in a weight-related
      sport are at increased risk for unhealthful weight-control behaviors and steroid 
      use. DESIGN: This was a population-based study (Project EAT [Eating Among
      Teens]). SUBJECTS/SETTING: Subjects were 4,746 adolescents (50.2% males, 49.8%
      females) from 31 public middle and high schools in the Minneapolis/St Paul area
      of Minnesota. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PERFORMED: Descriptive statistics, chi2
      analyses, and multiple logistic regression were used. Data were adjusted for
      sociodemographic variables and body mass index. MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLES:
      Unhealthful weight-control behaviors and steroid use. RESULTS: More males (20.4%)
      than females (16.2%) reported participation in a weight-related sport. Males who 
      reported participation in a weight-related sport had an increased risk of
      past-week vomiting (odds ratio [OR]=5.7), laxative use (OR=6.8), as well as
      past-year vomiting (OR=4.9), laxative use (OR=3.4), diuretic use (OR=6.0), and
      steroid use (OR=3.7), compared with those males who did not report participation.
      Females who reported participation in a weight-related sport had an increased
      risk of past week vomiting (OR=2.1), as well as past year vomiting (OR=2.0),
      laxative use (OR=2.6), and steroid use (OR=2.6), compared with those who did not 
      report participation in a weight-related sport. CONCLUSIONS: The current study
      shows that participation in a sport that adolescents perceive as emphasizing
      weight is strongly associated with unhealthful weight-control behaviors and
      steroid use. Preventive efforts, targeting parents, coaches, and adolescents are 
      needed to decrease this risk.

TI  - [A new model of sportive cooperation and its evaluation by means a
      questionnaire].
PG  - 425-32
AB  - We present in this paper the sportive cooperation as a theoretical framework for 
      the teams' dynamics, and as an alternative to others theories, specially the
      sportive cohesion. This theory has a double basis: 1) The rational and
      utilitarist decision taking upon the personal cooperation or not, with the team's
      goal, based on the internal teammates interaction, and the environmental stimuli;
      and 2) A personal, and more stable, disposition to cooperate, despite the
      possibility of obtain any counterparts for this behavior. From this framework, we
      have build--in a three phase process--a questionnaire addressed to evaluate the
      sportive cooperation. The final version--composed of 15 items with standard
      psychometric propierties--shows two kinds of factors. First, we have two
      dispositional, traitlike, factors: The Conditional cooperation, and the
      Unconditional cooperation. Second, we have three situational factors: the
      Cooperation with the Coach, with the teammates, and the Cooperation outside the
      game and the training. Lastly, we discuss the maining of this theory respect to
      the sportive team's dynamics, and its relevance for the applied psychology, both 
      for the evaluation and the interventions on the teams.

TI  - Youth sport dropout from the achievement goal theory.
PG  - 65-71
AB  - This study examined dropout behavior, using the conceptual framework of
      achievement goal theory. We hypothesized that dropout could be predicted by a
      high ego-oriented goal disposition in combination with a low perception of
      personal skill and the perception that the coach and sport peers maintained
      ego-oriented sport success criteria. The participants were 134 adolescent
      athletes involved in high-level competitive sports participation. The results of 
      structural equation modeling (SEM) supported these hypotheses. Furthermore, the
      variables that directly predicted sport dropout were the participant's ego
      orientation (positively) and perception of skill (negatively). These findings and
      the research prospects are discussed.

TI  - Prevalence of preseason conditioning among high school athletes in two spring
      sports.
PG  - 241-7
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence and predictors of preseason conditioning
      among high school athletes. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey of 451 high school
      athletes participating on girls and boys track and boys soccer teams in five
      public high schools in Seattle, WA, spring 2005. Questions were modified from
      validated surveys of physical activity for adolescents. The main outcome measure 
      was meeting criteria for adequate preseason conditioning, which specify a
      combination of aerobic conditioning (vigorous exercise for at least 300 min x
      wk(-1)) and stretching and strengthening exercises (at least three times a week
      for any duration). Log-binomial regression was performed to examine factors
      associated with preseason conditioning. RESULTS: The majority of athletes met the
      criteria for each of the components (59% for aerobic conditioning, 62% for
      stretching, 63% for strengthening). As defined by meeting the criteria for all
      three components, 33% of the athletes had adequate preseason conditioning. Of
      those athletes meeting criteria for all three components, the majority reported
      at least 1 month of conditioning to prepare for the season. Varsity athletes were
      more likely to meet the preseason conditioning criteria compared with junior
      varsity athletes (38 vs 25%, prevalence ratio 1.5, 95% CI 1.0-2.1). Athletes who 
      reported help with conditioning from a coach were twice as likely to have
      adequate preseason conditioning compared with those who did not receive help from
      a coach (45 vs 23%, prevalence ratio 1.8, 95% CI 1.3-2.4). CONCLUSION: The
      majority of athletes in this study did meet criteria for each individual
      conditioning component (aerobic, stretching, strengthening), but only a minority 
      met all three criteria. These findings highlight the need for school- or
      coach-sponsored involvement to ensure that all athletes engage in comprehensive
      preseason conditioning programs.

TI  - Influence of moderate dehydration on soccer performance: physiological responses 
      to 45 min of outdoor match-play and the immediate subsequent performance of
      sport-specific and mental concentration tests.
PG  - 385-91
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether moderate water loss (approximately 1.5-2% of body
      mass (BM)) represents a significant impairment to soccer match-play and the
      related fitness variables. METHODS: 11 moderately active male soccer players
      (mean (SD) age 24.4 (3) years, BM 74.03 (10.5) kg, peak oxygen consumption 50.91 
      (4.0) ml/kg/min) volunteered to participate. The experimental procedure
      comprised: (1) a 45 min pre-match period of cycle ergometry exercise (90% of
      individual ventilatory threshold); (2) the completion of a 45 min soccer match;
      and (3) the immediate post-match performance of sport-specific and mental
      concentration tests. The subjects completed the procedure on three occasions each
      in a different experimental condition (fluid intake (FL), no fluid (NF) and mouth
      rinse (MR)) in an individually randomised order. Core temperature (Tc), heart
      rates, plasma and urine osmolalities, BM, sweat rates and heat storage were all
      measured. RESULTS: The only condition-dependent difference during the match-play 
      element of the protocol was a significantly increased Tc in the NF condition
      compared with the FL condition (39.28 degrees C (0.35 degrees C) and 38.8 degrees
      C (0.47 degrees C), respectively; p<0.05). The immediate post-match performance
      of a sport-specific fitness test was significantly impaired where FL had been
      denied (p<0.01). The post-test evaluation of rating of perceived exertion and
      thirst indicated that the NF condition was perceived to be the most challenging
      (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The condition-dependent differences in match-play and
      post-match tests demonstrate that moderate dehydration is detrimental to soccer
      performance. However, it remains unclear whether this could be attributable to
      water loss in itself or the negative psychological associations derived from a
      greater perception of effort in that condition.

TI  - [Pre-adolescents and sport: results of a health survey in some secondary schools 
      of Brianza].
PG  - 535-42
AB  - This study is aimed at assessing time dedicated to, motivation and involvement in
      physical activity on behalf of pre-adolescents. 802 students (49.3% boys and
      50.7% girls; mean age: 12.6) attending 43 classes of 11 Brianza's post-elementary
      schools. A questionnaire was prepared and administered to the involved sample.
      Classes took part in this study through randomized selection and data were
      analyzed using program Epi Info 6. Most of the respondents (60.1%) stay involved 
      in sport because "it makes me feel good" and 32.4% because sport is "enjoyable
      and entertaining". Pre-adolescents chose the sport in which they become engaged
      on the basis of personal inclination (40%), in order to share experiences and
      their free time with friends (15.4%); 13.7% declare to prefer sport to be
      practiced in team. (13.7%). The most practiced sport are: football (51.3% boys,
      4.5% girls), volley (3.9%-36.4%), dance (0.8%-25.2%) e swimming (9.4%-14%). 80.8%
      in the sample practice physical activity in settings outside schools and, among
      these, 51.7% dedicate three or more hours weekly to extra-school activities.
      There are significant differences (p < 0.05) between males' and females'
      engagement in physical activity (mean value: 4.1 hours; males: 4.6 h, females:
      3.5 h). Among pre-teens, 18% declare to be physically inactive at all; 15.7% do
      not take part in sport activities because afraid to be bullied or shamed by
      peers. Research show that males are significantly more involved in physical
      activity than females.

TI  - Perceived verbal aggressiveness of coaches in volleyball and basketball: a
      preliminary study.
PG  - 526-30
AB  - This study examined verbal aggressiveness of coaches as perceived by their
      athletes, 108 senior athletes (57 boys and 51 girls) ages 15-19 years.
      Participants were basketball players (56 athletes) and volleyball players (52
      athletes) who completed questionnaires. The scale of verbal aggressiveness showed
      high internal consistency. A two-way analysis of variance, conducted using sex
      and sport as independent variables to examine interactions, yielded significant
      differences between adolescent volleyball and basketball athletes. Volleyball
      athletes had lower scores on the Verbal Aggressiveness Scale than basketball
      players. Research with larger samples and other sports is recommended.

TI  - Verbal aggressiveness and state anxiety of volleyball players and coaches.
PG  - 630-4
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to examine the relation of verbal
      aggressiveness and state anxiety (somatic, cognitive, and self-confidence) in
      sports settings based on the ratings by volleyball coaches and their athletes.
      The sample consisted of volleyball athletes (n=208; 98 men and 110 women) and
      their coaches (n=20; 16 men and 4 women). Analysis showed that male volleyball
      players rated somatic anxiety higher and were more affected by the verbal
      aggressiveness of their coaches than female volleyball players. No mean
      differences were significant for male and female coaches on somatic or cognitive 
      anxiety, self-confidence, or verbal aggressiveness. Also, correlation between
      subscale scores for male and female volleyball players and coaches was found. The
      correlations of verbal aggressiveness with self-confidence and anxiety were
      positive for these athletes, leading them to better behavior. This relationship
      needs further examination in sport settings.

TI  - Parental and coach support or pressure on psychosocial outcomes of pediatric
      athletes in soccer.
PG  - 522-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article was to examine supportive and/or
      pressuring influences of parents and coaches on young athletes' maladaptive
      perfectionist tendencies, relationships to friends, and competency perceptions in
      soccer. Previous research has revealed that parents and coaches may give rise to 
      both enjoyable and stressful sport experiences for the pediatric athlete and that
      parents and coaches are thus able to influence whether young people decide to
      quit sport or continue participating. Less is known about the relation of
      supportive versus pressuring parental and coach behaviors on the quality of
      athletes' achievement striving, relationships to friends in sport, and their
      competence perceptions. Such knowledge may help create a better psychological
      sport experience for pediatric athletes. DATA SOURCES/SYNTHESIS: A
      questionnaire-based cross-sectional field study was carried out among 677 young
      Norwegian soccer players (aged 10 to 14 years; 504 boys, 173 girls; mean age:
      boys = 11.9 years, SD = 2.9; girls = 11.2 years, SD = 2.1) taking part in the
      Norway Cup international youth soccer tournament in 2001. Multivariate analysis
      of variance (MANOVA) with follow-up canonical correlation was used to examine
      multivariate relationships between supportive and pressuring behavior and
      athletes' psychosocial experiences. RESULTS: Joint pressuring behaviors from
      parents and coaches related positively to maladaptive achievement striving, as
      indicated by overconcern for mistakes, doubt about one's soccer actions, and
      lowered perceptions of soccer competence. Mirroring these findings, predominantly
      supportive coach-created psychological climates were related to a linear pattern 
      of psychological outcomes comprising high-quality friendships, positive
      competency perceptions, and the absence of specific worries related to
      achievement striving. CONCLUSIONS: Supportive, mastery-oriented coach influence
      seems beneficial for constructive psychosocial outcomes in pediatric athletes,
      and athletes experiencing a joint social pressure to excel from coaches and
      parents may benefit less psychosocially through sport.

TI  - American College of Sports Medicine position stand: prevention of cold injuries
      during exercise.
PG  - 2012-29
AB  - It is the position of the American College of Sports Medicine that exercise can
      be performed safely in most cold-weather environments without incurring
      cold-weather injuries. The key to prevention is use of a comprehensive risk
      management strategy that: a) identifies/assesses the cold hazard; b)
      identifies/assesses contributing factors for cold-weather injuries; c) develops
      controls to mitigate cold stress/strain; d) implements controls into formal
      plans; and e) utilizes administrative oversight to ensure controls are enforced
      or modified. The American College of Sports Medicine recommends that: 1)
      coaches/athletes/medical personnel know the signs/symptoms and risk factors for
      hypothermia, frostbite, and non-freezing cold injuries, identify individuals
      susceptible to cold injuries, and have the latest up-to-date information about
      current and future weather conditions before conducting training sessions or
      competitions; 2) cold-weather clothing be chosen based on each individual's
      requirements and that standardized clothing ensembles not be mandated for entire 
      groups; 3) the wind-chill temperature index be used to estimate the relative risk
      of frostbite and that heightened surveillance of exercisers be used at wind-chill
      temperatures below -27 degrees C (-18 degrees F); and 4) individuals with asthma 
      and cardiovascular disease can exercise in cold environments, but should be
      monitored closely.

TI  - Blood tests in tired elite athletes: expectations of athletes, coaches and sport 
      science/sports medicine staff.
PG  - 41-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: The issue of the expectations of elite athletes, their coaches and
      non-medically qualified athlete support staff of consultations with sports
      physicians has not been previously dealt with in the sports medicine literature. 
      As fulfillment of expectations of the content of a consultation may influence
      patient's satisfaction and clinical outcome, it is important to assess the
      expectations of athletes and, most importantly, coaches. OBJECTIVE: To assess the
      expectations and beliefs about fatigue, particularly in relation to blood tests, 
      of athletes, their coaches and support staff in the specific context of tiredness
      of <7 days' duration. SUBJECTS: 28 senior sports science or non-medically
      qualified sports medicine staff, 22 elite coaches and 62 elite athletes from the 
      Australian Institute of Sport were included in this study. METHODS: A single
      questionnaire. RESULTS: The expectation for a blood test at the initial
      consultation for short-term fatigue was particularly high among athletes (81%)
      and coaches (91%). This expectation increased in athletes if their performance
      was worsening. All groups unanimously suggested that a blood test be performed in
      cases of more prolonged fatigue. Increase in total training load was perceived to
      be the most important cause of fatigue, but issues relating to sleep were also
      thought to be highly relevant. All groups suggested that blood tests provide some
      degree of reassurance, and all groups suggested that the most important blood
      tests that might be performed related to exclusion of iron deficiency, anaemia
      and infection. CONCLUSION: Athletes and their coaches generally expect that blood
      tests will be performed even when fatigue has been present for <1 week. This is
      at odds with currently available evidence of the diagnostic utility of these
      tests. Despite the current evidence base, individual factors in the athletes,
      coaches and doctors need to be considered when deciding on whether such testing
      has to be performed.

TI  - Sport for the transplant athlete-just harmless fun or a valuable tool?
PG  - 24-7
AB  - The persisting handicaps to full physical, mental and social rehabilitation in
      the recipient of a successful transplant are outlined. The benefit derived from
      sport with reference to the Transplant Games is summarized. An appreciation of
      the papers in this issue of the Annals of Transplantation is given. They were
      presented at the Second International Symposium on Sport and Transplantation held
      in conjunction with The European Society of Organ Transplantation on October 19th
      2005 in Geneva. The conclusion drawn is that the muscles of patients who have
      suffered end stage disease of a vital organ do not recover rapidly or
      spontaneously after a successful transplant and that the depression of VO2 Max
      gives a documented indication of this fact. The good news, however, is that
      appropriate physical activity and exercise is highly effective in overcoming the 
      deficit and sport is a vital component in the rehabilitation of the transplant
      recipient.

AB  - The case of a 45-year-old man is reported who was an active competitive sportsman
      up to his 38th year. In fall of 1998, exercise limitation was noted. The
      cardiologic work-up revealed dilated cardiomyopathy. In spite of intensive
      medical therapy clinical course deteriorated within the next 3 years, cardiologic
      findings and a follow-up in CPET (cardiopulmonary exercise testing) showed a
      rapid decline. In May 2002, he was listed for cardiac transplantation. In August 
      2003, an orthotopic bicaval cardiac transplantation was performed at the
      University of Gottingen, Germany. The patient was followed regularly in the
      office. Physical exercise capacity increased significantly and he was able to
      participate in the 10-km New Year's run of 2003. Since 2004, he has been working 
      very successfully as a coach for competitive swimmers. Based on CPET findings,
      actual views and concepts regarding the pathophysiology and training of chronic
      heart failure are discussed and the question is raised whether and in which
      respect a sportive predisposition favors the clinical outcome.

TI  - [Training in sports medicine for medical students--Evaluation of a
      practice-oriented teaching concept].
PG  - 117-22
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Education in Sports Medicine is offered heterogeneously in German
      medical schools. Efficacy and acceptance among medical students are unknown. The 
      self-image of sports has changed from a traditional, competition-oriented way to 
      adventure, entertainment, wellness and health. Therefore changes of our curricula
      to a practical oriented way of teaching are required. In this regard a new
      curriculum was developed. The main focus, besides an interdisciplinary class in
      sports medicine was to offer practical education in sports to the students.
      METHODS: Efficacy and acceptance of the class were evaluated using a
      questionnaire. 90 medical students (58 male, 32 female) were included into the
      study . RESULTS: The interdisciplinary topics of the class were graded
      positively. Most of the presentations were regarded as very useful for the future
      practice. Empathy and commitment of the professor were keystones to good scores. 
      The "fun-factor" was the key for the success of the practical assignment.
      Practical training was regarded as fundamental for a sports medicine class.
      DISCUSSION: Evaluation of the new concept as well as a discussion of the current 
      practice to teach sports medicine at medical school confirm the need of a more
      practical oriented education, in order to meet the requirements of sports
      medicine in a time with changing self image of sports.

TI  - Frequency and direction of competitive anger in contact sports.
PG  - 501-8
AB  - AIM: The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether athletes
      involved in physical contact sports may interpret their feelings of anger as
      facilitative of performance, and to examine differences in the interpretation of 
      anger as a function of the type of sport (team vs individual) or the competitive 
      skill level (high vs low). METHODS: A modified version of the State-Trait Anger
      Expression Inventory was administered to 100 Italian adult male athletes
      practicing rugby or individual combat sports (judo, freestyle wrestling, or
      Greco-Roman wrestling). The questionnaire was intended to measure the frequency
      and the direction (i.e., the facilitative-debilitative interpretation) of
      competitive anger. RESULTS: Many athletes engaged in contact sports tended
      interpret their competitive anger as facilitative of performance rather than
      debilitative. The type of sport and the athlete's standard level can mediate the 
      individual's interpretation of the effects of anger symptoms upon performance.
      CONCLUSIONS: Competitors can interpret their anger as helpful to energize
      behavior and channel physical and mental resources for skill execution.
      Practitioners should assist athletes in gaining control over anger rather than
      attempting to suppress it.

TI  - Measuring and predicting maximal aerobic power in international-level
      intermittent sport athletes.
PG  - 366-72
AB  - AIM: The purpose of this study was to measure actual VO2max during the
      multi-stage fitness test (MSFT) and to compare this with predicted values
      obtained using previously established, commonly used methods. We also wanted to
      determine a new and more accurate regression equation for the prediction of
      VO2max in intermittent sport athletes. METHODS: Twenty-six, elite, male,
      intermittent sport athletes performed the MSFT with oxygen uptake (VO2) and heart
      rate (HR) measured throughout. Paired t-tests were used to compare measured
      VO2max with predicted VO2max. Linear regression was used to determine the
      equation for the prediction of VO2max from the total number of shuttles
      completed. RESULTS: There were no differences between the two methods of
      predicting VO2max, however, both predicted values (53.6+/-3.9 and 51.3+/-4 mL x
      kg(-1) x min(-1)) were significantly lower (9.3% and 13.2%, respectively) than
      measured VO2max (59.1+/-6.6 mL x kg(-1) x min(-1), P < 0.001). Correlations
      between measured and predicted VO2max were similar for both prediction methods (r
      = 0.61, P = 0.013 and r = 0.68 and P = 0.004). We present a new prediction
      equation [Y (VO2max, mL x kg(-1) x min(-1)) = 0.38 x total number of shuttles
      completed +25.98] (where R = 0.69; R2 = 0.48; SEE = 4.9 mL x kg(-1) x min(-1);
      SEE% = 8.3) which provides a more valid method of predicting actual max in
      intermittent sport athletes. CONCLUSIONS: A new regression equation to predict
      VO2max in intermittent sport athletes has been established. Whilst some error in 
      predicting VO2max still exists, the new equation will provide coaches and
      sport-scientists with a more suitable equation with which to predict VO2max in
      intermittent sport athletes.

TI  - Perceptions of empathic accuracy and assumed similarity in the coach-athlete
      relationship.
PG  - 617-37
AB  - Drawing upon the methodology developed by Kenny and Acitelli (2001), this study
      examined empathic accuracy and assumed similarity in both parties' perceptions of
      coach-athlete relationships. One hundred and twenty-one coaches and athletes
      reported on their direct-perceptions and meta-perceptions of closeness,
      commitment and complementarity (3 Cs; Jowett & Cockerill, 2002), and of
      satisfaction with instruction, performance and external agents. There was
      evidence of both empathic accuracy and assumed similarity in coaches' and
      athletes' perceptions. Athletes were more accurate in identifying the specific
      content of their coaches' feelings in terms of closeness. Athletes and coaches
      from newly developed relationships displayed higher levels of empathic accuracy, 
      whereas female athletes displayed higher levels of assumed similarity. Moreover, 
      evidence suggested that athletes' and coaches' assumed similarity led to more
      accurate perceptions. Implications and future research directions are discussed.

TI  - Physical education and sport in schools: a review of benefits and outcomes.
PG  - 397-401
AB  - This paper explores the scientific evidence that has been gathered on the
      contributions and benefits of physical education and sport (PES) in schools for
      both children and for educational systems. Research evidence is presented in
      terms of children's development in a number of domains: physical, lifestyle,
      affective, social, and cognitive. The review suggests that PES have the potential
      to make significant and distinctive contributions to development in each of these
      domains. It is suggested that PES have the potential to make distinctive
      contributions to the development of children's fundamental movement skills and
      physical competences, which are necessary precursors of participation in later
      lifestyle and sporting physical activities. They also, when appropriately
      presented, can support the development of social skills and social behaviors,
      self-esteem and proschool attitudes, and, in certain circumstances, academic and 
      cognitive development. The review also stresses that many of these benefits will 
      not necessarily result from participation, per se; the effects are likely to be
      mediated by the nature of the interactions between students and their teachers,
      parents, and coaches who work with them. Contexts that emphasize positive
      experiences, characterized by enjoyment, diversity, and the engagement of all,
      and that are managed by committed and trained teachers and coaches, and
      supportive and informed parents, significantly influence the character of these
      physical activities and increase the likelihood of realizing the potential
      benefits of participation.

PG  - 64-8
AB  - To determine the influence of sexual dimorphism on mental characteristics in
      elite athletes, 24 sportsmen (18-27 years old) (17 men and 7 women members of
      Ukrainian National Judo Team), 20 sedentary men and 20 sedentary women (20-29
      years old) were studied. Results obtained confirmed significant difference of
      sexual dimorphism indices in athletes and sedentary people. It was determined
      that sexual dimorphism manifestations in athletes were as follows: (1) short
      memory capacity (62.58 +/- 3.21%) and coefficient of operational thinking (2.67
      +/- 0.16 standard units) was increased in women in comparison with men (55.78 +/-
      2.07% and 1.44 +/- 0.30 standard units, p < 0.05, accordingly), (2) on the
      contrary neurodynamic functions were decreased in women (latent time of simple
      (266.92 +/- 4.73 ms) and composite (494.44 +/- 6.38 ms) visual-motor reactions
      and power of nervous processes (18.49 +/- 8.93%) in comparison with men (239.62
      +/- 5.26 ms, 440.10 +/- 6.61 ms, 5.33 +/- 0.59%, p < 0.05, respectively). Results
      obtained indicate influence of sexual dimorphism on psychophysiological
      functions.

TI  - Sport psychology: psychologic issues and applications.
PG  - 519-35
AB  - This article has briefly highlighted the area of sport psychology as it relates
      to performance psychology skills (mental training), including a historical
      overview and current topics overview. The use of mental training skills may be of
      interest to the practicing physical medicine and rehabilitation professional in
      the treatment of his or her patients. It is important that the physical medicine 
      professional recognize what sport or performance psychology represents within the
      paradigm of psychologic interventions. Referring to an individual based on his or
      her training (licensed psychologist versus mental training consultant) is
      essential for the appropriate management of psychologic issues related to
      performance. The issues related to the psychologic rehabilitation of the injured 
      athlete are of importance to the medical staff; the overview of affective
      responses can assist in understanding the normal and adaptive responses of the
      injured athlete. Finally, a brief description of a psychologist's role within a
      sports medicine and rehabilitation practice is presented. The psychologic issues 
      that are present in the world of sport and elite performance are numerous, and
      not all are mentioned in this article. Issues of eating disorders, substance
      abuse, and psychologic health with athletes should be further explored within the
      physical medicine and rehabilitation discipline as well as in the sports medicine
      discipline. The ever-evolving psychologic dynamics of individuals involved in
      sport and elite performance are intriguing and unique. A specialized knowledge
      base, training, and experience in providing psychologic services are required to 
      treat this unique population. Counseling and clinical issues of the athlete and
      elite performer require further attention in the realm of psychologic
      interventions, including further exploration of the efficacy of interventions for
      performance enhancement. The field of applied sport psychology may offer the
      physical medicine professional a unique perspective into the care of patients who
      are athletes and elite performers.

TI  - Dental squash injuries - a survey among players and coaches in Switzerland,
      Germany and France.
PG  - 231-6
AB  - Squash belongs to sporting activities with medium risk of causing dental trauma. 
      Because of high velocity, close body contact and the use of rackets the injury
      potential in squash has increased. The aim of this work was to conduct a
      comparative study between Switzerland, Germany and France on a number of issues: 
      the frequency of dental and facial injuries in squash, athletes' habits of
      wearing mouthguards, as well as the general level of information about emergency 
      measures after a dental trauma and the resulting consequences. Using a
      standardized questionnaire a total of 653 individuals, 600 squash players and
      their 53 coaches, were interviewed. In each of the three countries 200 players
      belonging to four different divisions (juniors, amateurs, semi-professionals and 
      professionals) were surveyed. Of these 653 interviewees 133 (20.4%) have already 
      observed a dental injury; 27 (4.5%) have experienced a dental trauma themselves. 
      Less than half of all interviewed players and coaches (47.6%) were aware of the
      possibility of replanting avulsed teeth. Just 5.1% were familiar with the tooth
      rescue kit. Only one individual wore a mouthguard. The results show that the area
      of squash requires more information about prevention through sports associations,
      coaches and dentists.

TI  - [The bill of rights for children in sport: a tool to promote the health and
      protect the child in sport].
PG  - 1774-7
AB  - The Bill of rights for children in sport was developed in response to the need
      for prevention and protection of children practicing sport. It is the result of
      an interdisciplinary approach and is used with young sportsmen, sport clubs and
      in the education of the professionals involved with children's sport. It is an
      excellent tool to sensitize people to children's vulnerabilities and to establish
      the bases for prevention and protection. In complete accordance with the UN
      Convention on the Rights of the Child, this Bill gives an example of a concrete
      application in the field of Sports. Used on a regular basis in the field, it
      contributes to change the adult's vision of children's sport and the approach to 
      coaching;

TI  - Psychophysiological diagnostics of functional states in sports medicine.
PG  - 205-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The methods of psychological diagnostics ignored the integral
      criteria of functional states which are used in athletes. That is the reason why 
      the elaboration of psychophysiological diagnostics criteria for higher
      qualification athletes was performed. BACKGROUND: The diagnostics of
      psychophysiological functions obtains information on individual and typological
      characteristics of higher neural system, peculiarities of forming and improvement
      of special experience and indicators of fatigue and hypertension of athletes.
      METHODS: The 26 higher qualification athletes (men), members of National team
      (Judo) were examined. The psychophysiological and neurodynamic functions such as 
      functional mobility of nervous processes, strength of nervous processes, time
      perception, attention volume, operational thinking coefficient and short-term
      memory volume were registered by a computer system. The differential scale of
      functional states of psychophysiological functions in athletes was elaborated.
      RESULTS: The results of the investigation showed that 10 subjects had high
      parameters of functional states of psychophysiological functions and 14 have the 
      intermediate level. The functional states of psychophysiological functions in
      higher qualification athletes characterize the functional system responsible for 
      the results of sport. The optimization of the perception and information
      processing using the short-term memory reflects the psychophysiological
      compensatory mechanisms of a decline of visual perception and information
      processing capability in athletes. CONCLUSIONS: The psychophysiological states in
      higher qualification athletes are characterized by the functional system
      responsible for the result of sport (Tab. 7, Ref. 13).

TI  - NCAA coaches survey: the role of the coach in identifying and managing athletes
      with disordered eating.
PG  - 447-66
AB  - The primary objective of the present study was to survey collegiate coaches with 
      respect to how female athletes with disordered eating or eating disorders are
      identified, how coaches are involved, and the identification criteria used. An
      additional objective was to determine how symptomatic athletes are managed
      regarding treatment and sport participation. Participants were 2,894 coaches
      representing 23 sports. Findings indicated that athletic trainers, teammates, and
      coaches are frequently involved in identification. Eating disorder symptoms were 
      most often used to identify symptomatic athletes, and athletes from high-risk
      sports were more often identified. Coaches rated symptoms as being serious, both 
      in terms of how they affect the athlete's health and her athletic performance,
      with amenorrhea being a notable exception. Implications of the study were
      discussed in terms of education and training of coaches and athletic trainers.

TI  - Maternal recall of children's consumption of commercial and sport-caught fish:
      findings from a multi-state study.
PG  - 198-204
AB  - A randomized telephone survey of 3015 women was conducted in an effort to assess 
      the effectiveness of local sport-fish consumption advisories. Survey participants
      were between the ages of 18 and 45 and lived in the states of Arkansas,
      California, Connecticut, Florida, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, New Jersey, New
      Mexico, North Carolina, and Wisconsin. At the time of the women's interview, fish
      and shellfish consumption information was obtained for children under 18 years of
      age living in the household. One child (aged 2-17) from each household (1852) was
      randomly selected to evaluate fish consumption among children. Based on maternal 
      recall, 84% of these children had consumed fish or shellfish at least once during
      the previous 12 months. This percentage ranged from 73% in New Jersey to 94% in
      Louisiana and was higher among children who lived with a licensed angler compared
      to those who did not. Eight percent of the children ate fish and/or shellfish
      more than twice a week. Of the total number of fish and shellfish meals eaten by 
      children, 67% was commercial finfish, 22% was shellfish, and 11% was sport-caught
      finfish. Among those who ate fish, the average consumption rate was 47 meals per 
      year-slightly less than one meal per week. This consumption frequency rate varied
      by state of residence ranging from 37 meals per year in Montana and Wisconsin to 
      62 in Florida. Because of these regional differences, the use of national average
      fish consumption rates may over- or under-estimate consumption in localized
      areas. This survey suggests that targeting information to women who eat fish may 
      also protect children; more than 80% of children have fish consumption patterns
      that are similar to that of their mothers. Additional research and biomonitoring 
      is needed to improve our understanding of the risk and benefits associated with
      childhood consumption of fish and shellfish.

TI  - Nutrition and eating in female college athletes: a survey of coaches.
PG  - 209-20
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to gather information from coaches regarding
      their monitoring/management of athlete eating and weight, knowledge of
      nutritional health issues, availability of prevention/intervention services for
      athletes at their school, experience with athletes exhibiting symptoms of eating 
      and body image disturbances, and their attitudes toward eating and weight in the 
      sport. A total of 303 coaches (51% response rate) involved in six sports (i.e.,
      gymnastics, swimming, basketball, softball, track, and volleyball) at all levels 
      of collegiate competition (NCAA Divisions I, II, III, and NAIA) completed a
      40-item survey. Gender was found to be related to differential responding on only
      one of the 40 items, while sport and level of competition were related to
      responses on multiple items. Gymnastics coaches and NCAA Division I coaches
      differed significantly from coaches of other sports and divisions in that they
      reported more monitoring/management behaviors, had more experience with athletes 
      exhibiting eating disturbances, and had more resources available for preventing
      and treating athletes with eating disorders. Gymnastics coaches also differed
      from other coaches on a number of items related to their attitudes toward eating 
      and weight in the sport. Many coaches have encountered disturbed eating among
      their athletes, and some of their coaching attitudes and behaviors may
      inadvertently increase the risk for such disturbances. Implications for clinical 
      and sport psychologists providing prevention or intervention services to
      intercollegiate athletes are discussed.

TI  - Evaluation of sports nutrition knowledge of New Zealand premier club rugby
      coaches.
PG  - 214-25
AB  - Little is known about if and how team coaches disseminate nutrition information
      to athletes. In a census survey, New Zealand premier rugby coaches (n = 168)
      completed a psychometrically validated questionnaire, received by either Internet
      or standard mail (response rate, 46%), identifying their nutrition advice
      dissemination practices to players, their level of nutrition knowledge, and the
      factors determining this level of knowledge. The majority of coaches provided
      advice to their players (83.8%). Coaches responded correctly to 55.6% of all
      knowledge questions. An independent t-test showed coaches who imparted nutrition 
      advice obtained a significantly greater score, 56.8%, than those not imparting
      advice, 48.4% (P = 0.008). One-way ANOVA showed significant relationships between
      total knowledge score of all coaches and qualifications [F(1,166) = 5.28, P =
      0.001], own knowledge rating [F(3,164) = 6.88, P = 0.001] and nutrition training 
      [F(1,166) = 9.83, P = 0.002]. We conclude that these rugby coaches were
      inadequately prepared to impart nutrition advice to athletes and could benefit
      from further nutrition training.

TI  - Pre-exercise stretching and sports related injuries: knowledge, attitudes and
      practices.
PG  - 228-31
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pre-exercise stretching (PES) has been common practice prior to
      participation in athletic events. Despite evidence for lack of benefit, many
      coaches continue to routinely instruct and prescribe stretching. This study
      assesses the knowledge, attitudes and practices of high school coaches regarding 
      PES. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Multiple high schools in a
      Southeast Michigan county. PARTICIPANTS: Head coaches (n = 71) at ten county high
      schools completed the survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Knowledge, attitudes and
      practices of high school coaches regarding PES. RESULTS: The survey was completed
      by coaches at 10 of 11 public high schools with an overall response rate of 46%. 
      Coaches stretch athletes for an average of 13 minutes prior to practice or
      competition. Almost 95% of coaches feel stretching is beneficial, specifically in
      decreasing injury risk. Nearly 73% believe that there are no drawbacks to
      stretching. The most significant reason cited for stretching is decreased injury 
      risk. Coaches stated that personal experience and scientific evidence are the two
      factors that would most likely influence their future recommendations regarding
      PES. There are statistically significant differences in stretching practices
      between male and female coaches and experienced and inexperienced coaches.
      CONCLUSIONS: Despite the lack of evidence, nearly all coaches believe that PES
      prevents a wide array of injuries. Although coaches value personal experience in 
      determining their PES practices, they are open to new scientific evidence, which 
      should encourage the medical community to deliver current research.

TI  - Sports-science roundtable: does sports-science research influence practice?
PG  - 161-8
AB  - As sports scientists, we claim to make a significant contribution to the body of 
      knowledge that influences athletic practice and performance. Is this the reality?
      At the inaugural congress of the Australian Association for Exercise and Sports
      Science, a panel of well-credentialed academic experts with experience in the
      applied environment debated the question, Does sports-science research influence 
      practice? The first task was to define "sports-science research," and it was
      generally agreed that it is concerned with providing evidence that improves
      sports performance. When practices are equally effective, sports scientists also 
      have a role in identifying practices that are safer, more time efficient, and
      more enjoyable. There were varying views on the need for sports-science research 
      to be immediately relevant to coaches or athletes. Most agreed on the importance 
      of communicating the results of sports-science research, not only to the academic
      community but also to coaches and athletes, and the need to encourage both short-
      and long-term research. The panelists then listed examples of sports-science
      research that they believe have influenced practice, as well as strategies to
      ensure that sports-science research better influences practice.

TI  - Motivational factors associated with sports program participation in middle
      school students.
PG  - 696-703
AB  - PURPOSE: The purposes of this study were 1) to identify gender-specific
      motivational factors associated with sports program participation and attrition
      in middle school students and 2) to examine the relationships among sports
      program participation, physical activity, and sedentary behavior in this age
      group. METHODS: Seventh and eighth grade students (N = 1692) completed a
      questionnaire to measure sports program participation and factors that may
      motivate continued participation in or attrition from sports. The psychometric
      properties of the participation and attrition scales were tested using
      gender-separate exploratory factor analysis. Analysis of variance (participation 
      status*gender) was used to identify differences in motivational factor scores and
      physical activity variables. RESULTS: Eighty percent of the students were recent 
      participants (within the past year), 10% were former participants, and 10% had
      never participated. For boys, the participation factors were labeled (in order)
      competition, social benefits, and fitness. For girls, factor structures were
      slightly different than the boys, which loaded as; social + skill benefits,
      competition, and fitness. For both genders, lack of interest, coaching problems, 
      and time barriers were identified as attrition factors. Recent sport participants
      reported more time in vigorous (p < .01), stretching (p = .03), and strengthening
      activities (p < .01) and less time watching television (p < .01). CONCLUSIONS:
      Gender-specific motivational factors exist for middle school youth; boys are more
      attracted to the competitive aspects of sports whereas girls are more motivated
      by the social opportunities that sports provide. Boys and girls who participate
      in sports are more physically active, so it is important to develop programs that
      children want to participate in and maximize retention.

TI  - Improved perceived health status persists three months after a special sports
      camp for children with congenital heart disease.
PG  - 767-72
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although summer and sports camps for children with congenital heart
      disease are organized in many countries and regions, empirical data on the
      effects of such camps is limited. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to
      investigate changes in the perceived health status and habitual physical
      activities in children attending a special sports camp. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In
      this longitudinal study, 25 children with congenital heart disease who
      participated in a three-day multi-sports camp were included. The perceived health
      status was measured using the Child Health Questionnaire-Child Form, CHQ-CF87,
      completed by the child at the start of the camp (T1), at the end of the camp
      (T2), and 3 months after the camp concluded (T3). Habitual physical activities
      were assessed by means of a modified version of the Baecke questionnaire, which
      was completed by one of the parents at T1 and T3. RESULTS: During the sports
      camp, we observed significant improvements in the children's perception of their 
      physical functioning, role-physical functioning, general health, role-emotional
      functioning, self-esteem, mental health, and general behavior. For physical
      functioning, role-emotional functioning, and family activities, high scores
      persisted three months after the sports camp concluded. The habitual physical
      activities (sport and leisure time) of the children remained unchanged.
      DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we propose that a special sports camp
      for children with congenital heart disease may improve specific dimensions of
      subjective health status. Our study confirms a previous report on the benefits of
      such camps for afflicted children. If these findings can be further corroborated 
      in other settings, participation in sport camps should be advocated as a simple, 
      noninvasive means to promote healthier children.

TI  - Understanding the role parents play in tennis success: a national survey of
      junior tennis coaches.
PG  - 632-6; discussion 636
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess coaches' perceptions about the role of parents and their
      positive and negative behaviours in junior tennis. METHODS: A national survey of 
      132 United States junior tennis coaches was completed. The extent and
      seriousness/impact of parent-child interaction problems and positive behaviours
      were rated. RESULTS: Parents were perceived as very important for junior tennis
      success. Most parents (59%) that these coaches had worked with were seen as
      having a positive influence on their player's development. However, the
      respondents also felt that 36% of parents negatively influenced their child's
      development. Positive parental behaviours included providing logistical,
      financial, and social-emotional support, as well as tennis opportunities and
      unconditional love. Negative parent behaviours included overemphasising winning, 
      holding unrealistic expectations, and criticising their child. CONCLUSIONS:
      Findings are discussed relative to current sport parenting and athletic talent
      development research and theorising. The need to educate parents is emphasised.

TI  - Age and education in moral judgment of participants in team sports.
PG  - 247-53
AB  - The present aim was to investigate the effect of age and education on the moral
      reasoning of the same 535 individuals in sports for whom nature of sport
      experience was reported. All 535 participants (M age = 24.9 yr., SD = 8.3) were
      involved in sports at the time of the study as athletes (n = 342), referees (n = 
      145), or coaches (n = 48), and had a wide range of education. Analysis of
      variance of scores on the Defining Issues Test of Rest showed moral judgment in
      sports differs significantly amongst different age groups (F5.510 = 5.37, p <
      .001) and amounts of education (F4.511 = 6.24, p < .001). Generally, with more
      education, higher moral judgment can be expected. It is apparent that moral
      development in sport is related to age and education, as also holds for a wider
      social setting.

TI  - Mental practice and acquisition of motor skills: examples from sports training
      and surgical education.
PG  - 297-304, ix
AB  - Learning surgical skills involves both fine and gross motor skills, and
      necessitates performance in stressful situations. This environment is similar to 
      the environment in which an athlete performs. Mental imagery has been used
      successfully in training athletes of all levels of proficiency and enhances both 
      motor skills and motivational skills of performing under stress. The literature
      of using mental imagery to train surgeons is limited to the teaching of simple
      surgical skills, but shows promise as another tool to teach technical skills.

TI  - Athletes' evaluations of their head coach's coaching competency.
PG  - 111-21
AB  - This study provided initial validity evidence for multidimensional measures of
      coaching competency derived from the Coaching Competency Scale (CCS). Data were
      collected from intercollegiate men's (n = 8) and women's (n = 13) soccer and
      women's ice hockey teams (n = 11). The total number of athletes was 585. Within
      teams, a multidimensional internal model was retained in which motivation, game
      strategy, technique, and character building comprised the dimensions of coaching 
      competency. Some redundancy among the dimensions was observed. Internal
      reliabilities ranged from very good to excellent. Practical recommendations for
      the CCS are given in the Discussion section.

TI  - Mouthguard utilization rates during sport activities in Ankara, Turkey.
PG  - 127-32
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the attitudes towards mouthguard use
      in Ankara, Turkey. In the first part of this study, an eight-item questionnaire
      was distributed to 22 coaches from 15 secondary schools randomly selected from
      five municipalities of Ankara, Turkey. The questionnaire sought information on
      how much coaches know regarding mouthguards and how often children and
      adolescents of the ages 11-18 use mouthguards. The second part of the study was
      based on the data obtained from direct interviews answered by 121 university
      athletes of three different sport modalities (football, ice hockey and martial
      arts). The purpose of this part of the study was to determine the rate of
      mouthguard use and the frequency and type of oral trauma in these athletes. The
      result of the coaches' questionnaires revealed that; none of the 11-18 years old 
      children and adolescents used mouthguards while participating in sports. Of the
      coaches, 77.2% had seen orofacial trauma in this age group during sport
      activities and 95.5% of the coaches believed that mouthguards prevented oral
      injuries. Of the coaches, 72.7% reported that children and adolescents should use
      mouthguards in sport activities. The second part of the study showed that
      although all of the athletes owned mouth-formed type of mouthguards, the
      utilization rate was 74.4%. Of all players, 13.2% had suffered from one or more
      form of oral injury while not wearing mouthguards. The results show that in
      Turkey, the use of mouthguards has not become widespread in sports. It can be
      concluded that regular mouthguard use in sports should be encouraged in Turkey.

      strain injury.
PG  - 87-90
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if there is any decrease in playing performance of
      athletes following return to sport after recovery from hamstring muscle strain
      injury. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: One professional
      Australian football team over two playing seasons. METHODS: For every game, the
      team coach rated player performance proportional to time spent on the ground
      playing (an integer score out of a maximum of 10). Player performance ratings
      were compared pre- and post-hamstring muscle strain injury to assess player
      performance upon return to sport. RESULTS: Thirteen athletes had hamstring
      injuries and the required player ratings were available. The mean player
      performance rating for the entire playing season in which the player was injured 
      was 6.9. The mean player performance rating for the two games prior to injury was
      6.8 as opposed to 5.4 for the two games after return to sport. Athletes had a
      significantly lower player performance rating immediately upon return to sport
      when compared to ratings for the entire season (p<0.001) and when compared to
      ratings from the two games prior to injury (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Following
      return to sport from hamstring injury, player performance as assessed by the team
      coach is reduced. This suggests that some athletes may return to sport prior to
      complete resolution of the injury.

TI  - A new framework for research leading to sports injury prevention.
PG  - 3-9; discussion 10
AB  - This paper proposes a new sports injury research framework, the Translating
      Research into Injury Prevention Practice framework, or TRIPP. This model builds
      on the fact that only research that can, and will, be adopted by sports
      participants, their coaches and sporting bodies will prevent injuries. Future
      advances in sports injury prevention will only be achieved if research efforts
      are directed towards understanding the implementation context for injury
      prevention, as well as continuing to build the evidence base for their efficacy
      and effectiveness of interventions. There is no doubt that intervention research 
      in the sporting field can be difficult and many challenges need to be overcome;
      however, that should not be put up as a barrier towards undertaking it. Over the 
      next few years, sports injury researchers will need to think carefully about the 
      "best" study designs and analysis tools to achieve this. All reported sports
      injury studies, of whatever design, should include information on key
      implementation factors such as player/club recruitment rates and other biases as 
      well as the rate of uptake of the interventions being tested, including reasons
      for use/non-use. However, it will only be broad research endeavours that adopt
      the TRIPP six-staged approach that will lead to real-world injury prevention
      gains.

TI  - Coach talk: linguistic demands inherent in youth sports.
PG  - 39-49
AB  - PURPOSE: This investigation expands the notion of academic language to
      extracurricular activities and provides preliminary data regarding linguistic
      expectations that are place on students who are participating in youth sports.
      METHOD: Five coaches of young girls' basketball teams (2 competitive; 3
      recreational) were observed during practice sessions divided into individual
      versus group and stationary versus active contexts. Communication was
      characterized with various measures of content, form, and use. RESULTS: Coaches
      rarely used pauses or communicative repetitions. Recreational coaches' utterances
      contained more mazes than competitive coaches' utterances. Utterances used during
      stationary activities tended to be longer and contain more than one verb compared
      to utterances used during active activities; sentence fragments were more
      frequent during active contexts. All coaches used jargon quite frequently.
      CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The system reported here can be used to document
      linguistic demands in other extracurricular activities, such as music programs
      and scouting. Speech-language pathologists might include clinical activities to
      help students deal successfully with the linguistic requirements that are
      inherent in sporting activities.

TI  - The coaching schematic: validation through expert coach consensus.
PG  - 549-64
AB  - Current research in coaching development infers that coaching is predominantly a 
      decision-making process. The same and other research is not, however, informing
      the coaching development process due to a lack of a big picture approach.
      Consequently, there is a need for a model of coaching. In this paper, we offer
      such a model in the form of a schematic that reflects the coaching process from
      both a content and information-processing stance. To assess the validity of the
      schematic, 16 expert coaches were interviewed to elicit a complete description of
      their coaching process. The coaches were then shown a copy of the schematic and
      asked to comment on its design and content with respect to its accuracy in
      reflecting their coaching process. Following analysis of the interview, six
      general categories emerged: Roles, Goals, Typical Actions, Required Knowledge,
      Support for the Schematic, and Factors Influencing Development. The first four
      categories clearly displayed an implicit support for the schematic. Furthermore, 
      all coaches offered explicit support for the schematic. Such strong support
      confirmed that the schematic was valid and could form the basis of focused
      interventions in coaching development.

TI  - [Endometriosis coaching].
PG  - 329-36
AB  - Coaching is a well-known terminology and an approach currently used, particularly
      in the worlds of company management and sport, but its use in the medical field
      appeared only recently. In the latter field, coaching bears behavioral and
      psychological aspects. It can not only be intended to a medical team, but also
      the practionner himself, for a better management of any disease, his patient for 
      a better treatment effect and compliance and an optimal coping with the disease. 
      In the case of endometriosis, a chronic disease, two key aspects are briefly
      reviewed to illustrate the benefits of coaching and to sensitize health providers
      to this approach. Thus, an appropriate diagnostic strategy should allow to reduce
      the delay in the diagnosis, so frequently blamed, and to identify other
      associated painful diseases. Also, management should be improved as well, not
      only by applying appropriate therapeutic recommandations, and alternative
      measures, but also by a better multidisciplinary support towards patient
      expectations with long-term guidance.

TI  - Developing a game plan for good sportsmanship.
PG  - 127-34, 15
AB  - It is widely believed in the United States that competition is beneficial for
      youngsters. However, the media are full of examples of players, fans, and coaches
      whose behavior veers out of control. There have been well-documented examples of 
      youth in livestock competitions illegally medicating show animals to make them
      appear calmer, officials biasing their rulings toward a team that will take the
      most fans to a playoff game, and team rivalries that have become so caustic as to
      be dangerous for competitors and fans. A university extension and its partners
      created a program called "Great Fans. Great Sports." in order to teach the kinds 
      of behaviors we wish to instill among all who are involved in competitions. It
      requires entire communities to develop and implement plans for enhancing
      sportsmanship in music, debate, drama, 4-H, and other arenas, as well as sports. 
      The goal is to make good sportsmanship not the exception but the norm. The
      authors provide anecdotal evidence that "Great Fans. Great Sports." is having a
      positive impact on the attitudes and behaviors of competitors, fans, and
      communities.

TI  - Youth Sports: A Pediatrician's Perspective on Coaching and Injury Prevention.
PG  - 466-70
AB  - OBJECTIVE: My objective is to review the factors that influence youth
      participation in sports, to discuss the role coaches may play in youth sports
      injuries, and to call on athletic trainers and other health professionals to
      become involved in youth sports in an effort to limit injury risk. BACKGROUND:
      Millions of American youths participate in team sports. Their primary motivation 
      to participate is to have fun. Unfortunately, large numbers of participants have 
      sustained correspondingly large numbers of injuries. Many injuries can be
      attributed to improper technique and conditioning methods taught by volunteer
      coaches. Although not the only contributors to injuries, these may be the most
      amenable to preventive measures, such as formal instruction for coaches in the
      areas of proper biomechanics and player-coach communication. DESCRIPTION: I
      provide an overview of the reasons why children participate in sports, discuss
      participation motivation, and review the literature on coaches' communication
      methods that have been proved effective in maximizing learning and enjoyment for 
      young athletes. CLINICAL ADVANTAGES: This article provides certified athletic
      trainers with the background knowledge needed to take an active role in youth
      sports injury prevention at the community level.

      coaches.
PG  - 267-71
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the first-aid knowledge and decision making of
      interscholastic athletic coaches exposed to athletic injuries. DESIGN AND
      SETTING: Survey demographic information, First- Aid Assessment, and Game
      Situation Data Sheet in 17 metropolitan high schools. SUBJECTS: A total of 17
      metropolitan high schools participated in this study, and 104 athletic coaches
      completed questionnaires. Fifteen different athletic sports were represented in
      this investigation. Thirty coaches (29%) worked with more than one athletic sport
      during the year. Male subjects constituted 83% (n = 85) of the sample. Years of
      coaching experience ranged from first-year coaches to those with more than 28
      years of experience. Most coaches (61%, n = 63) investigated were teachers, and
      the remaining subjects were walk-on coaches. MEASUREMENTS: Central tendency
      scores were determined in the demographic analysis. x(2) analyses were performed 
      to determine the interaction between First-Aid Assessment and the Game Situation 
      Data. RESULTS: Thirty-eight (36%) of the 104 athletic coaches tested achieved
      passing scores of 29 or higher, with the total scores ranging from 19 to 34. For 
      the Game Situation Data Sheet, 75% (n = 78) of the coaches selected the same
      response to 7 questions. Most coaches in this study chose to return injured
      players to the game. We analyzed the data to determine whether coaches who passed
      the First-Aid Assessment responded differently than those who did not. (The
      scenario presented in one question involved a starting player's sustaining injury
      when losing a close game.) Coaches who passed the First-Aid Assessment tended to 
      return injured starters to the game, whereas those who failed it kept injured
      players out of the game. x(2) analysis on the second question (the team is
      winning a close game when a regular player is injured) showed no tendency for
      passing or failing coaches to respond differently. CONCLUSIONS: The athletic
      coaches did not adequately meet first-aid standards as established for this study
      in accordance with the American Red Cross. In addition, coaches who passed the
      First-Aid Assessment tended to return an injured starter to the game, whereas
      those who failed decided to keep the player out of the game. It is critical that 
      an unbiased, objective professional person provide all medical care on the
      athletic playing field, preferably one who is certified in athletic training.

TI  - Collegiate coaches' knowledge of eating disorders.
PG  - 19-24
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess, through exploratory research, 1) collegiate coaches'
      knowledge of eating disorders, 2) the confidence of collegiate coaches in their
      response correctness to questions about eating disorders among athletes, and 3)
      demographic data related to prior education about eating disorders and the role
      of the athletic department in providing such educational experiences. DESIGN AND 
      SETTING: We distributed a 2-part questionnaire to 258 NCAA Division I-A coaches
      from 5 universities selected by sampling convenience. SUBJECTS: One hundred
      thirty-eight collegiate coaches responded to the questionnaire for a response
      rate of 53.5%. MEASUREMENTS: Our survey consisted of 30 true-false questions that
      tested knowledge of eating disorders overall and in 5 domains. These domains
      included etiology, identifying signs and symptoms, management and treatment, risk
      factors, and education and prevention of eating disorders. Coaches indicated
      their level of certainty in their responses by rating their confidence level on a
      4-item Likert-type scale. Demographic data focused on educational programs
      attended by coaches and teams. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze all
      data. RESULTS: Our results suggest a need for coaches to achieve a greater
      knowledge of eating disorders in all domains. Evidence showed that educational
      programs about eating disorders were not often sponsored by the athletic
      department for coaches or athletes. There seemed to be poor communication between
      athletic departments and coaches regarding the availability of eating disorder
      educational resources. CONCLUSIONS: Data suggested coaches could benefit from
      comprehensive education in all domains of eating disorders; however, further
      study is needed to validate these findings, to determine the actual effectiveness
      of education in the prevention of eating disorders, and to differentiate coaches'
      knowledge specific to sport coached and to coach and team sex.

TI  - Epicondylar injury in sport: epidemiology, type, mechanisms, assessment,
      management and prevention.
PG  - 151-70
AB  - Epicondylar injuries in sports with overhead or repetitive arm actions are
      frequent and often severe. Acute injury that results in inflammation should be
      termed epicondylitis and is usually the result of large valgus forces with medial
      distraction and lateral compression. Epicondylosis develops over a longer period 
      of time from repetitive forces and results in structural changes in the tendon.
      Epicondylalgia refers to elbow pain at either the medial or lateral epicondyl of 
      the elbow related to tendinopathy of the common flexor or extensor tendon origins
      at these points. Pain is usually associated with gripping, resisted wrist
      extension and certain movements such as in tennis and golf, hence the common
      terms 'tennis elbow' (lateral epicondylsis) and 'golf elbow' (medial
      epicondylossi). A variety of assessment and diagnostic tools are available to aid
      the clinician in their comprehensive evaluation of the patient to ensure correct 
      diagnosis and the appropriate conservative or surgical management strategy.
      Corticosteroids and elbow straps are often used for treatment; however, there is 
      only very limited prospective clinical or experimental evidence for their
      effectiveness. The most effective modalities of treatment are probably rest (the 
      absence of painful activity) combined with cryotherapy in the acute stage then
      NSAIDs and heat in its various modalities including ultrasound. Cortisone
      injections may be used to create a pain-free window of opportunity to optimise
      the athletes' rehabilitation exercises. Medical practitioners should have a good 
      understanding of the mechanisms of injury in order to help treat and prevent the 
      re-occurrence of injuries. More emphasis by medical and sport science personnel
      working with coaches and athletes needs to be placed on prevention of elbow
      injury in sport through improved joint strength, biomechanically sound sport
      technique and use of appropriate sport equipment.

TI  - Sports nutrition for young athletes.
PG  - 323-8
AB  - Nutritional needs for peak athletic performance include sufficient calorie
      intake, adequate hydration, and attention to timing of meals. Student athletes
      and their advisors often are misinformed or have misconceptions about sports
      nutrition. This paper identifies nutritional needs of young athletes, reviews
      common misconceptions, and examines the nutrition knowledge of athletes and their
      sources of nutrition information. Topics covered include energy, carbohydrate,
      protein, fat and micronutrient needs, hydration requirements, timing of meals,
      and issues related to age, gender, and specific sports. Other issues addressed
      include "making weight" and ergogenic aids. Proper nutrition for young athletes
      is critical not only to their athletic success, but more importantly to their
      growth, development, and overall health. Nutritional recommendations should be
      based on the most current scientific data; we provide information about
      appropriate resources for the school nurse when advising student athletes and
      their coaches and parents.

TI  - A cross-cultural analysis of positive illusions and sport performance levels in
      American, Croatian, and Norwegian basketball players.
PG  - 453-8
AB  - The present study examined the degree to which positive illusion is associated
      with sport performance in basketball players among 3 different cultures: The
      United States of America, Croatia, and Norway. Positive illusion is a cognitive
      characteristic that is common in mentally healthy individuals, and becomes
      especially important in the athletic arena. The model tested in this study
      depicts the level of positive illusion as the main predictor variable and the
      performance of the basketball players as the criterion variable. The Positive
      Illusion Sports Scale was used to measure the predictor variable while The
      Basketball Evaluation System was used to measure the criterion variable.
      Participants were 239 competitive male basketball players, 122 from USA, 57 from 
      Croatia and 60 from Norway. Results showed that positive illusion was directly
      (positively) related to actual success and that these relationships were
      statistically significant and consistent with positive illusion as a theoretical 
      construct for predicting behavior and success.

TI  - Artificial intelligence in sports biomechanics: new dawn or false hope?
PG  - 474-9
AB  - This article reviews developments in the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in
      sports biomechanics over the last decade. It outlines possible uses of Expert
      Systems as diagnostic tools for evaluating faults in sports movements
      ('techniques') and presents some example knowledge rules for such an expert
      system. It then compares the analysis of sports techniques, in which Expert
      Systems have found little place to date, with gait analysis, in which they are
      routinely used. Consideration is then given to the use of Artificial Neural
      Networks (ANNs) in sports biomechanics, focusing on Kohonen self-organizing maps,
      which have been the most widely used in technique analysis, and multi-layer
      networks, which have been far more widely used in biomechanics in general.
      Examples of the use of ANNs in sports biomechanics are presented for javelin and 
      discus throwing, shot putting and football kicking. I also present an example of 
      the use of Evolutionary Computation in movement optimization in the soccer throw 
      in, which predicted an optimal technique close to that in the coaching
      literature. After briefly overviewing the use of AI in both sports science and
      biomechanics in general, the article concludes with some speculations about
      future uses of AI in sports biomechanics. Key PointsExpert Systems remain almost 
      unused in sports biomechanics, unlike in the similar discipline of gait
      analysis.Artificial Neural Networks, particularly Kohonen Maps, have been used,
      although their full value remains unclear.Other AI applications, including
      Evolutionary Computation, have received little attention.

TI  - Using Rasch measurement to investigate volleyball skills and inform coaching.
PG  - 39-54
AB  - This paper illustrates some of the ways that Rasch modeling techniques can be
      used to inform coaching of volleyball. Volleyball game statistics for 11
      volleyball players collected over 27 matches on 3 skills were analyzed using a
      multifaceted Rasch model (Lincare, 1999) incorporating the partial credit model
      (Masters, 1982). Rating scale analyses and model fit statistics were used to
      derive interval level scales that provided more objective information regarding
      player ability and consistency than is usually available to coaches. Detailed
      results illustrate that Rasch analyses can provide very specific information that
      coaches might use in drill, practice, and game strategy design.

TI  - Towards the reflective sports coach: issues of context, education and
      application.
PG  - 1711-20
AB  - The current demands faced by elite sports coaches and the nature of their
      educational experiences are outlined. Examination of current approaches to coach 
      education are considered in relation to research evidence which describes the key
      skills required in elite sports coaching. Recently, reflective practice has
      emerged as a key skill with which to enhance coach learning and increase the
      value of coaches' educational experiences. In tracing this emergence, this study 
      analyses the use of reflective practice and learning strategies within six
      governing body award coaching programmes. Results indicate that none of the
      programmes examined contained structures or processes for directly teaching or
      overtly nurturing reflective skills. However, almost all programmes offered a
      potential structure for this through completion of a coaching log or undertaking 
      a period of mentoring. Finally, recommendations are made to coach educators for
      developing reflection within coach education programme structures.

TI  - Volunteer youth sport coaches' perspectives of coaching education/certification
      and parental codes of conduct.
PG  - 324-38
AB  - The vast majority of youth sport programs in the United States relies primarily
      on parent volunteers to serve as coaches. Unfortunately, most of these volunteer 
      coaches have not received formal training to prepare them adequately for the role
      of youth sport coach. To exacerbate the issue, according to the popular media,
      parents and other adults can commit belligerent and even violent acts around, and
      often resulting from, poorly managed youth sport events. Although some efforts
      have been made to standardize curricula, provide training for coaches, and
      contain or prevent inappropriate parent behaviors, few efforts have been directed
      at investigating the self-described needs and concerns of the coaches from their 
      perspectives. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the concerns
      and issues of youth sport coaches related to coaching and parental education.
      Five focus group interviews with 25 volunteer youth sport coaches were conducted 
      to investigate these issues. Results were organized around four higher order
      themes that emerged from inductive content analyses: (a) coaching education
      content areas of need, (b) barriers and problems of offering coaching education, 
      (c) coaching education format recommendations, and (d) efficacy of parental codes
      of conduct. Results were discussed in terms of the potential impact
      administrators, coaches, and parents could have in implementing formal coaching
      education programs and developing their coaching education practices.

TI  - The parent-coach/child-athlete relationship in youth sport: cordial, contentious,
      or conundrum?
PG  - 286-305
AB  - The roles of coach and parent are often synonymous in youth sport, but little
      data-based research has been conducted on the parent-coach/child-athlete
      relationship. Six boys in U-12 competitive soccer were interviewed regarding
      positive and negative aspects about playing for their father-coach. Similar
      questions were posed to father-coaches and two teammates. Inductive content
      analysis indicated that, among the benefits, sons identified perks, praise,
      technical instruction, understanding of ability level, insider information,
      involvement in decision making, special attention, quality time, and motivation. 
      Costs of being coached by one's father included negative emotional responses,
      pressure/expectations, conflict, lack of understanding/empathy, criticism for
      mistakes, and unfair behavior. For father-coaches, positive themes included
      taking pride in son's achievements, reason for coaching, positive social
      interactions, opportunity to teach skills and values, enjoying coaching son, and 
      quality time. Negatives included inability to separate parent-child from
      coach-player role, placing greater expectations and pressure on son, and showing 
      differential attention toward son. While teammates perceived some favoritism by
      the parent-coach, they cited mostly positive instructional experiences. Results
      are discussed within motivational theories that highlight the influence of
      significant adults on children's psychosocial development in the physical domain.

TI  - Sports massage. A comprehensive review.
PG  - 370-80
AB  - The science of sports massage is of interest to many populations including
      athletes, athletic trainers, coaches, as well as sports physiologists. While
      evidence to support or refute the effects of massage on sports performance is
      insufficient to make definitive statements, new reports and trends within data
      help formulate an understanding of sports massage. This article will review
      sports massage research on topics including lactate clearance, delayed onset of
      muscle soreness (DOMS), muscle fatigue, the psychological effect of massage, and 
      injury prevention and treatment. Articles referenced in Medline, Cochrane
      Database, the authors library, and references from articles are included in this 
      review. Most studies contain methodological limitations including inadequate
      therapist training, insufficient duration of treatment, few subjects, or over or 
      under working of muscles that limit a practical conclusion. Muscle soreness
      associated with DOMS is reduced with massage, although whether force recovers
      more quickly is still unclear. The research literature to date is insufficient to
      conclude whether massage facilitates recovery from a fatiguing effort. Both
      tissue healing and a psychological effect of massage are areas that may prove
      promising with further research. Results from published literature support a
      positive trend for massage to benefit athletic recovery and performance; a need
      for further research into sports massage, especially well-designed studies
      utilizing therapists specifically trained to administer this type of therapy, is 
      warranted.

TI  - The use of relaxation, hypnosis, and imagery in sport psychiatry.
PG  - 973-7, xi
AB  - Hypnosis is a procedure during which a mental health professional suggests that a
      patient experience changes in sensations, perceptions, thoughts, or behavior. The
      purpose of this article is to briefly describe the use of various methods of
      relaxation, hypnosis, and imagery techniques available to enhance athletic
      performance. The characteristics that these techniques have in common include
      relaxation, suggestibility, concentration, imaginative ability, reality testing, 
      brain function, autonomic control, and placebo effect. Case studies are provided 
      for illustration.

TI  - The sport psychiatrist and golf.
PG  - 959-71, xi
AB  - The sport psychiatrist is well-positioned to consult to competitive golfers. The 
      interrupted pace of play in golf provides ample time for the golfer's thoughts to
      go awry. The sport psychiatrist can work with competitive golfers in refining
      their strategies for dealing with these myriad distractions and stressors. The
      authors review pre-performance routine and methods for optimizing focus, and
      discuss the science behind being "in the zone." The authors also discuss how
      acute performance failure, or "choking," is best understood as being three
      separate disorders. The sport psychiatrist's unique role in competitive,
      professional golf is discussed by employing the concept of a sports mental health
      continuum and its relation to psychiatric disorders.

TI  - Systemic issues involved in working with professional sports teams.
PG  - 929-42, x
AB  - Sport psychiatrists face a number of systemic and intra-psychic issues when
      treating professional athletes. Although only a modicum of literature exists to
      aid sport psychiatrists, there are several steps they may take to become an
      integral part of an athletic organization and to be successful in the treatment
      of the athletes themselves. The ability to delineate their role within the sports
      club is crucial to mental health professionals' organizational success. Equally
      important, it is incumbent upon sport psychiatrists to recognize and transcend
      intra-psychic issues that occur between athlete and physician.

TI  - Aggression and sport.
PG  - 845-52, ix
AB  - Viewing aggression in its healthy form, in contrast to its extreme and
      inappropriate versions, and sport as a health-promoting exercise in psychological
      development and maturation may allow participants and spectators alike to retain 
      an interest in aggression and sport and derive further enjoyment from them. In
      addition, it will benefit all involved with sport to have a broader understanding
      of human aggression. Physicians, mental health professionals, and other health
      care providers can be influential in this process, and should be willing to get
      involved and speak out when issues and problems arise.

TI  - Achievement by proxy distortion in sports: a distorted mentoring of
      high-achieving youth. Historical perspectives and clinical intervention with
      children, adolescents, and their families.
PG  - 805-28, viii
AB  - This article describes potentially pathogenic behavior in youth sports. It
      delineates the four stages of achievement by proxy distortion (ABPD) behavior and
      attempts to raise awareness of that behavior and to facilitate communication
      among sports medicine and psychiatry professionals of the potential for
      exploitation and abuse of children and adolescents by parents, mentors, coaches, 
      and the systems that nurture and develop these children. Information is presented
      to distinguish motivations behind normal parenting from those that lead to risky 
      sacrifice, objectification of the child, and potential abuse. Distinct abuse
      stages of ABPD are described. The authors identify "red flags" that indicate
      distorted views and potentially harmful behavior toward children.

TI  - Interviewing principles for the psychiatrically aware sports medicine physician.
PG  - 745-69, vii
AB  - This article describes how sports medicine physicians can best approach the
      diagnoses of mental illness in athletes. Examples of psychiatric problems common 
      to athletes, their incidences in the population, and diagnostic tips to ferret
      them out are given. Vignettes of well-known athletes who have had these problems 
      are included. Each highlights how the lack of diagnostic awareness of mental
      health issues in the athletic community and the stigma of "mental illness"
      prevented the athlete from getting treatment sooner.

TI  - Changes in perceived health of children with congenital heart disease after
      attending a special sports camp.
PG  - 67-72
AB  - Sports camps for children with cardiac anomalies have existed for many years.
      However, no formal evaluation of the benefits of attending such camps has been
      undertaken heretofore. We assessed potential changes in the self-perceived health
      of children with congenital heart disease who attended a special sports camp.
      Thirty-one children with cardiac anomalies attended a 3-day multisports camp.
      Sixteen children, all of whom were 10 years or older, literate, and Dutch- or
      French-speaking, completed the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ-CF87) before and
      after attending the camp. The scores of the children were compared with those of 
      healthy peers by calculating mean standardized differences. After attendance at
      the sports camp, the children achieved significant improvements in the
      self-perception of their physical functioning, role functioning due to emotional 
      problems, role functioning due to behavioral problems, mental health, and general
      behavior. The children's self-esteem and general behavior after the camp were
      significantly better than that of their healthy counterparts. We conclude that
      children with congenital heart disease who participate in activities at special
      sports camps may reap benefits in terms of their subjective health status.
      Although further research is needed, we recommend the participation in sport
      activities by children with heart defects, and more specifically their
      participation in sports camps.

TI  - Long-term trends in home advantage in professional team sports in North America
      and England (1876-2003).
PG  - 337-50
AB  - Home advantage is quantitatively defined and calculated for each season since the
      start of the main professional sports in North America and England. Over 400,000 
      games are analysed. The leagues represented are the National League (1876-2002)
      and American League (1901-2002) for baseball, the National Hockey League
      (1917-2003) for ice hockey, the National Football League (1933-2002) for American
      football, the National Basketball Association (1946-2003) for basketball, and the
      four levels of professional football, formerly called the Football League, in
      England (1888-2003). Problems caused by unbalanced playing schedules are
      considered. The results are presented graphically to show long-term trends and
      sudden changes. The highest levels of home advantage for all sports were in their
      early years of existence. Home advantage in ice hockey, basketball and football
      in England has declined over the last two decades. In baseball there has been
      very little change over the last 100 years, with home advantage consistently
      lower than in other sports. There was a large drop in home advantage in football 
      in England following the 7-year suspension of the league during the Second World 
      War. The trends and changes provide some evidence that travel and familiarity
      contribute to home advantage, but little in support of crowd effects.

TI  - [Nurturing fair play in competitive sports. Results from a study on competitively
      oriented youth soccer].
PG  - 881-90
AB  - Apologists of sports praise them as an ideal way to prevent addiction and
      violence. Sports critics see it rather as a socialization authority on the morals
      of the fair foul. This contradiction was investigated based on an examination of 
      fairness behaviour and fairness education in youth soccer as well as the question
      of the connection between sports and violence and the preventive possibilities of
      sports. Our results point to differences in understanding fairness according to
      age, sex and primarily performance/success orientation. Teenagers learn al ready 
      at the latest in the C youth that it is important and right in the interest of
      success to break rules. Thus it applies that the more distinctive the success
      orientation, the more in formal and formal fair play degenerate into fictitious
      action morals of competitive sport and make way for morals of the "fair foul".
      The coaches play an important, even quite obviously the central role as
      socialization agents. In stead of learning fairness, the opposite is often
      conveyed to many young people in the organizations. However, our examinations
      also show that coach es can positively influence both fairness understanding and 
      fairness behaviour of young footballers. Coach es are thus challenged as role
      models to exemplify fair play by their own actions.

TI  - Level of information concerning dental injuries and their prevention in Swiss
      basketball--a survey among players and coaches.
PG  - 195-200
AB  - Basketball carries a medium risk of dental injuries. Swiss data are not available
      in this respect. Using a standardized questionnaire 302 basketball players from
      29 Swiss teams and their 29 coaches were interviewed. The questions focused on
      the frequency of dental accidents, their prevention and subsequent procedure. The
      participating 302 players came from three divisions: semi-professional players of
      National League A and B (102), amateurs of Regional League 2 and 3 (100) and
      young people of up to the age of 18 (100). The data were evaluated in relation to
      division, sex and team function. Of the 331 interviewed persons 102 had already
      seen a dental trauma in basketball and 55 had already had a dental trauma. Only
      four of the interviewed persons wore mouthguards. The awareness of the procedure 
      following a dental trauma was unsatisfactory. The results of the survey show that
      significantly more information and education is required in Swiss basketball not 
      only through sports associations but also through coaches and dentists.

TI  - Perceptions of Chandigarh sports coaches regarding oro-facial injuries and their 
      prevention.
PG  - 67-70
AB  - Enthusiastic participation by the younger generation in sports exposes them to a 
      high risk of injuries. In the present study, the perceptions of sports coaches
      regarding their knowledge and experience of such injuries is evaluated. The
      coaches considered helmet as the most common protective device followed by mouth 
      guard and facemask. About 58% observed that boxing was associated with oro-facial
      injuries and protective devices were deemed mandatory by 68% in this event. About
      45% saw over five injuries in the last year, mostly soft tissue facial injuries
      (47%) and tooth loss (33%). Most injuries were in hockey and 32% were due to hits
      by ball, stick or related hard objects. About 82% were related to nonuse of
      protective devices. The majority of coaches considered that oro-facial devices be
      made more popular among sportspersons for their safety while 28% felt they
      reduced efficiency. The author concludes that there is a need to popularize the
      use of oro-facial protective devices in a variety of sports events in our country
      by interacting with coaches, sports administrators and sportspersons as well as
      familiarizing the Indian dentists in this relatively new field.

PG  - 663-79, x
AB  - This article reviews what is known about training room psychiatric/psychological 
      issues and how to recognize them, and provides an initial framework for how to
      manage them. There is some focus on psychiatric issues involved in collegiate
      sports medicine environments, because the majority of research on this topic has 
      been done with this population, but it is believed that this information
      generalizes to other athletic settings. Greater awareness of these problems,
      empirical research, and education about mental health issues in the sports
      medicine community is clearly needed.

TI  - Health risks of dietary intake of environmental pollutants by elite sportsmen and
      sportswomen.
PG  - 1713-21
AB  - The dietary intake of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), lead (Pb),
      hexachlorobenzene (HCB), polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs), polycyclic aromatic
      hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated diphenyl ethers (PCDEs), polybrominated
      diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polychlorinated
      dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) by elite sportsmen and sportswomen 
      of Catalonia, Spain, was assessed. In 2000, food samples were randomly acquired
      in various cities of Catalonia. Analysis of the above pollutants were determined 
      according to the appropriate analytical techniques (ICP-MS, HRGC/HRMS, HPLC). In 
      general terms, elite sportsmen and sportswomen showed a higher intake of Cd, Hg, 
      Pb, HCB, PCNs, PCDD/Fs and PAHs than the general population, while it was lower
      for PCDEs (both sexes), and PCBs and PBDEs (women). According to the FAO/WHO
      provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) for metals, the WHO tolerable daily
      intake (TDI) for HCB, and the US EPA's reference dose (RfD) for PAHs, the dietary
      intakes of environmental pollutants should not mean a potential toxic hazard.
      However, the WHO-TDI for PCDD/Fs and "dioxin-like" PCBs is exceeded in sportsmen.
      The current results indicate that the consumption of those food groups showing
      the highest contribution to the intake of these pollutants should be diminished. 
      In relation to this, the reduction of the consumption of dairy products and
      cereals would be important.

TI  - The validity of a four week self-recall of sports injuries.
PG  - 135-7
AB  - The ability of sports injury studies to provide reliable incidence estimates
      depends on accurate injury data. One of the most commonly used methods of
      collecting injury data is through self-report, but the validity of such
      information is largely unknown. This study validated a four week self-report
      sports injury recall against a range of external sources including hospital
      records, health practitioner records, and third parties. Cases were drawn from
      the larger, Western Australian Sports Injury Study (WASIS). This study
      demonstrates acceptable to good levels of agreement between self-report and more 
      objective data in relation to details such as the nature and body part injured,
      and the level of injury treatment sought (kappa = 0.48 to 0.78). However,
      self-reported injury severity did not agree with the Injury Severity Score
      classification of severity.

TI  - Coaching in northern canadian communities: reflections of elite coaches.
PG  - 113-23
AB  - This study addressed geographical uniqueness in relation to elite coaching. The
      study explores the complexities associated to coaching in northern Canadian
      communities, and how unique geographical surroundings can affect coaching
      success. The views of fourteen National and International elite coaches from
      different northern Canadian communities are included within the study. The
      respondents were from 9 different sport backgrounds and averaged 17.1 years of
      coaching experience (range: 8-30 years). Data were gathered using a structured
      open-ended questionnaire, a focus group, and a follow-up in-depth semi-structured
      interview. Content was analyzed to uncover emergent themes. Based on the
      respondents' views, there is indication that despite numerous adversities, rural 
      coaches experience advantages that are unavailable in larger urban centers.
      Precisely, there is evidence that northern Canadian coaches acquire unique skills
      while responding to the demands placed on them within their unique communities.
      Generalizations in regards to coaching development strategies across physical
      locations are questioned following the findings of the current study. Key
      PointsThe study explores the complexities associated with coaching in northern
      Canadian communities and how unique geographical surroundings can affect coaching
      success.From the respondents' views, there is indication that northern Canadian
      elite coaches are subject to numerous adversities.Despite numerous adversities,
      northern Canadian elite coaches experience advantages that are unavailable in
      larger urban centers.Including context specificity within the elite coaching
      literature could help to better understand this profession.

TI  - Sport psychology: training the mind for competition.
PG  - 160-4
AB  - An optimal psychologic state for peak athletic performance is strongly documented
      in the sport psychology literature. A wealth of peer-reviewed studies also
      strongly supports the role that mental skills training (MST) plays in the
      development of this state. However, some disagreement exists in the sport
      psychology community over how best to deliver the MST tools and skills necessary 
      for optimal sport performance. Mental training consultants and intervention
      researchers have recently suggested that periodization of mental training may be 
      the next major leap forward in applied sport psychology program delivery. This
      new method of "training the mind" is presented and discussed.

TI  - Reliability of the Lode Excalibur Sport Ergometer and applicability to
      Computrainer electromagnetically braked cycling training device.
PG  - 344-8
AB  - New technology allows cyclists to train via power output (PO) in addition to
      heart rate (HR). For those athletes undertaking seasonal laboratory testing
      (e.g., Vo(2), lactate threshold), it is imperative that athletes be able to
      directly apply this information to their training device. We examined the
      reliability of a standardized laboratory ergometer (Lode Excalibur Sport) and its
      applicability to an electromagnetically braked ergometer (Computrainer) in 2
      phases. Phase I (n = 12) examined the reliability of the Lode. Phase II (n = 14) 
      compared the Lode to the Computrainer using a randomized, counterbalance
      assignment. Following warm-up, each trial started at 100 W, progressing 50 W
      every 3 minutes to exhaustion. Outcomes were time-to-exhaustion (TTE), peak PO
      (W) (PO(peak)), peak HR (HR(peak)), and ventilatory (VT) and respiratory
      compensation (RCP) thresholds. We used a repeated measures analysis of variance
      (ANOVA), Tukey post hoc analysis, regression analysis, Bland-Altman plots, and
      coefficient of variation (CV) analysis for each variable. During phase I, we
      found no significant difference for any variable, minimal dispersion of Vo(2)
      during Bland-Altman analysis, and a low CV at each test stage (</= 5%). During
      phase II, significant differences and higher CV for most parameters (all data; p 
      < 0.001) were observed for Lode versus Computrainer: TTE (21 minutes, 12 seconds 
      +/- 3 minutes, 12 seconds vs. 19 minutes, 9 seconds +/- 2 minutes, 36 seconds; CV
      = 16%), PO(peak) (335 +/- 57.8 W vs. 295 +/- 47.1 W, CV = 17%), as well as PO at 
      VT (CV = 51%) and RCP (CV = 24%; p < 0.01). We conclude that coaches and cyclists
      may need to use some caution when directly transferring results obtained from
      laboratory testing to the Computrainer training device.

TI  - Sleep apnea and sports performance.
PG  - 329-41, x
AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea is a significant medical disorder that is increasingly
      recognized for its wide-ranging effects on physical and mental health. It can
      have a profound negative impact on sleep quality, daytime alertness, mood, and
      cardiovascular health, and effects on metabolic and endocrinologic parameters.
      There is little known about the prevalence and presentation of apnea in athletes 
      and its potential effect on athletic performance. A high index of suspicion for
      apnea should exist, particularly in those who have anatomic features and symptoms
      consistent with the disorder. This article reviews pathophysiology, diagnostic
      modalities, and treatment interventions.

TI  - Playing their part: the role of physical activity and sport in sustaining the
      health and well being of small rural communities.
PG  - 109
AB  - It is widely recognised that the health of rural Australians is poor in
      comparison with their urban counterparts. Similarly, the role played by physical 
      activity in maintaining health has been well researched and is well documented.
      However, little appears to have been published in recent years about the links
      between physical activity and health in rural communities. The objective of this 
      article was to begin to address that gap. To achieve this, the article drew on
      research conducted in two small rural communities in Victoria Australia, and
      highlighted the role that physical activity and sport played in sustaining the
      health and wellbeing of individuals and communities in rural areas. Taking the
      World Health Organisation's definition of health (a state of complete physical,
      mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease) as its
      measure, the paper highlighted the many ways in which physical activity and sport
      in rural communities contribute to physical health, mental wellbeing and social
      cohesiveness. Based this finding, the authors suggest that physical activity and 
      sport make a significant contribution to the health and wellbeing of rural people
      and their communities and suggest that further research is necessary to better
      define this apparent contribution.

TI  - [ How to gauge the importance of sports medicine for the medical training of
      medical students?].
PG  - 247-51
AB  - AIM: Education in sports medicine is offered heterogeneously in German medical
      schools. The self-image of sports has changed from a traditional,
      competition-oriented way to adventure, entertainment, wellness and health.
      Therefore, changes of our curricula to a practical-oriented way of teaching are
      required. In a first step the motivations and expectations of the students have
      to be evaluated. METHODS: 90 students enrolled in a sports medicine class were
      evaluated using a questionnaire and compared to 60 students not participating in 
      the sports medicine class. RESULTS: The main motivation for the students to sign 
      in was the future possibility to subspecialize in sports medicine, followed by
      interest in the subject. The main reasons not to participate were the time factor
      followed by lack of interest. 80 % of the students were regularly practising
      sports. 66 % commented on having been involved in sports trauma. 90 % of the
      students believe that practical-oriented education is absolutely necessary.
      CONCLUSION: Evaluation of the students motivation, knowledge as well as a
      discussion of the current practice to teach sports medicine at medical school
      confirm the need for modification of our curricula to a more practical-oriented
      education.

TI  - Interventions implemented through sporting organisations for increasing
      participation in sport.
PG  - CD004812
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is now compelling scientific evidence that increased levels of 
      physical activity can bring wide-ranging health benefits. These benefits can
      extend beyond physical health and include other positive impacts relating to
      mental health and personal development. The sport and recreation sector is viewed
      as a priority area for increasing rates of physical activity. Participation rates
      have been shown to be lower in females, decline with age, and are reduced in
      lower socio-economic and minority groups. It is important to determine the most
      effective interventions that sporting organisations can use to increase
      participation. OBJECTIVES: To review all controlled evaluation studies of
      interventions organised through sporting settings to increase participation.
      SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
      (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsyclNFO, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, Sociological
      Abstracts, Dissertation Abstracts, and a number of freely-available online health
      promotion and sports-related databases. The internet was used extensively to
      search for studies and locate information generated by sporting bodies throughout
      the world. SELECTION CRITERIA: Types of studies: Controlled evaluation studies.
      No minimum follow-up required. Uncontrolled studies, meeting other inclusion
      criteria, were to be reported in an annex to the review. TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS:
      People of all ages. Types of interventions: Any intervention designed to increase
      active and/ or non-active participation in sport. These could include: mass media
      campaigns; information or education sessions; management or organisational change
      strategies; policy changes, for example to improve the socio-cultural environment
      to encourage people of specific age, gender or ethnicity to participate; changes 
      to traditional or existing programs, for example club or association-initiated
      rule modification programs; provision of activities beyond traditional or
      existing programs, for example 'Come and Try' initiatives (teaser or taster
      programs); skill improvement programs; volunteer encouragement programs. Types of
      outcome measures: Change in the number of (active and non-active) participants in
      organised sport, change in status from non-participating to non-active or active 
      participation, change in status from non-active to active participation. DATA
      COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We assessed whether identified citations were controlled
      evaluation studies which investigated the use of interventions implemented in
      sporting settings to increase participation. Two reviewers independently
      inspected abstracts. We obtained full papers where necessary. As no controlled
      evaluation studies were located, no data collection or analysis was undertaken.
      No uncontrolled studies meeting other inclusion criteria were identified and
      therefore no annex is presented. MAIN RESULTS: Despite a thorough review of the
      published and unpublished literature, we were unable to locate any rigorous
      studies which tested the effects of interventions organised through sporting
      organisations to increase participation in sport. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is 
      an absence of high quality evidence to support interventions designed and
      delivered by sporting organisations to increase participation in sport.
      Interventions funded and conducted in this area must be linked to a rigorous
      evaluation strategy in order to examine overall effectiveness, sociodemographic
      differentials in participation and cost-effectiveness of these strategies.

TI  - Identity tensions in lesbian intercollegiate coaches.
PG  - 67-81
AB  - Using social identity perspective, we investigated the experiences of 13 lesbian 
      college coaches. Through semistructured interviews, the coaches revealed the
      daily identity tensions they experienced. There was constant negotiation between 
      their social identities of "coach" and "lesbian." The social context of
      intercollegiate women's athletics created a complex web that juxtaposed these
      identities against commanding social norms. The challenges these coaches faced
      ranged from doing what they believed was best for the well being of their
      athletes (e.g., fighting homonegativism) versus what was best for their
      professional well being (e.g., remaining silent). These coaches did not passively
      accept their fate; while they struggled with identity negotiation, they also
      found ways to counter the heterosexist atmosphere and create positive social
      change.

TI  - Medicolegal issues affecting sports medicine practitioners.
PG  - 50-7
AB  - The practice of sports medicine represents a unique subspecialty within the
      discipline of medicine. Practitioners provide care for athletes who engage in
      activities that may put the athletes at risk for serious injury. Physicians may
      be held legally liable for not doing a standardized pre-participation evaluation,
      for not administering adequate on-site or after injury care, or for violating an 
      individual's civil rights by refusing to allow continued participation because of
      medical risk. The courts now are being asked to define obvious and necessary
      risks. Medical law addresses the behavior, obligation, and liability-affecting
      physicians who provide care for athletes. Many ethical and medicolegal issues
      must be resolved by the legal system because coaches, athletic trainers, on-call 
      physicians, physicians providing pre-participation physicals, and the team
      physician are being held responsible for injuries sustained during athletic
      competition. This review is intended to assist all physicians who take care of
      athletes by outlining their legal obligations and risks. Armed with this
      knowledge, we expect that the sports medicine physician will be better able to
      focus on patient care within the context of medicolegal obligations.

TI  - Cardiological telemonitoring in rehabilitation and sports medicine.
PG  - 121-30
AB  - The paper presents the development results of teleconsultative cardiology systems
      and their application in rehabilitation and sport medicine. The first
      teleconsultative cardiology (TELECARD) system was developed for outpatient
      departments in the city of Kaunas, using Internet links. It was based on the
      CompCardioSignal terminal. One branch of the TELECARD system with a mobile
      CompCardioSignal terminal was used for functional state evaluation of Lithuanian 
      sportsmen during the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games. The examined results have shown
      that every sportsman responded differently to acclimatization and the TELECARD
      system provided support to physicians and coaches for making optimal decisions
      regarding the sportsmen's adaptation and other situations. The final telemetry
      system was used for rower monitoring. It was based on the new CompCardioSignal
      terminal with three EASI ECG leads and synchronously recorded motion signals for 
      evaluation of human reaction to physical load. The developed telemonitoring
      systems were a useful tool for evaluation of human reaction to physical load in
      rehabilitation and sports activities.

TI  - Medical considerations in triathlon competition: recommendations for triathlon
      organisers, competitors and coaches.
PG  - 143-61
AB  - Competitors in triathlons experience a range of environmental conditions and
      physiological demands in excess of that found in individual sport events of
      comparable duration. Consequently, there is a broad range of possible medical
      problems and complications that must be taken into account when preparing for
      such races. For most competitors, an Olympic-distance triathlon typically takes
      between 2-4 hours to complete. This race begins with a swimming segment of 1500
      m. Given the wide variety of race venues found around the world, these swims
      occur in an assortment of water temperatures (from warm to cold) and conditions
      (from ocean surf to lake calm). Swimmers often exit the water in a state of
      moderate dehydration and hypothermia and then immediately start the 40 km cycling
      leg. Many do so in their swimming attire. A wide variety of road surfaces,
      technically challenging topography, variable environmental conditions and
      dramatically changing velocities can be encountered on the cycle course. The race
      concludes with a 10 km running leg. Since it is the final leg, it is often
      completed in higher ambient temperatures than those encountered at the start,
      with the athlete possibly running in a significant state of dehydration and
      fatigue. Other medical problems commonly encountered in triathlon include: muscle
      cramping, heat illness, postural hypotension, excessive exposure to ultraviolet
      radiation, musculoskeletal injuries and trauma, gastrointestinal problems as well
      as post-race bacterial infection, immunosuppression, sympathetic nervous system
      and psychological exhaustion, and haemolysis. The rate of occurrence of such
      events and the severity of their potentially negative outcomes is a function of
      the methods used by both the race organisers and the competitors to prevent or
      respond to the conditions imposed by the race. Triathletes also commonly compete 
      in both shorter 'sprint distance' events (in the range of a 0.75 km swim, 20 km
      cycle and 5 km run) and longer events including both one-half and full Ironman
      distances (2.5 and 3.8 km swim, 80 and 180 km cycle, 20 and 42 km run,
      respectively), as well as ultra-distance events that exceed the Ironman distance.
      In the longer events, the previously mentioned medical considerations are further
      magnified and additional considerations such as hyponatraemia can also occur.
      Reducing risk associated with these concerns is accomplished by: taking into
      account weather and water temperature/conditions data prior to event scheduling; 
      effective swim, cycle and run course organisation and management; environmental
      monitoring prior to and during the event; the implementation of a water safety
      plan; provision of appropriate fluid replacement throughout the course;
      implementation of helmet use and non-drafting regulations in the cycling leg; and
      competitor knowledge regarding fluid replacement, biomechanical technique,
      physical preparation, safe equipment and course familiarity. Despite these
      concerns, triathlon participation appears to relatively safe for persons of all
      ages, assuming that high-risk adults undertake health screening.

TI  - Health promotion by means of health sport--a framework and a controlled
      intervention study with sedentary adults.
PG  - 13-20
AB  - Only 10-20% of adults in industrialized countries reach the health-related
      minimum level of a consumption of energy of more than 800 kcal week(-1),
      additional to activities of daily living. The objective of this longitudinal
      study was to evaluate the impact of a health-promoting exercise program for
      sedentary adults on medical and subjective health status and on behavioral
      changes. The first 12 months of the study (t1-t2) consisted of a structured
      intervention exercise program. After this period, participants had the
      opportunity to stay in a follow-up-program or to change to other programs of the 
      same club for further 12 months (t2-t3). Within these 2 years data have been
      collected from the intervention group (117 subjects) and control group (40
      subjects). It can be shown that on the basis of a structured intervention (one
      session per week, 90 min, for 1 year), a stable behavioral change is reached with
      positive effects on fitness status, risk factors and mental health. Contrary to
      findings in other studies, the average health effects are at least stable in the 
      second year in this study.

TI  - Analysis of coaching science research published from 1970-2001.
PG  - 388-99
AB  - The study followed a four-phase design. In Phase I an exhaustive search was
      conducted for all English language coaching research published in journals from
      1970 to 2001. In Phase II, copies of the research were obtained. An expert panel 
      conducted a manual search and a review in Phase III to address validity. Analysis
      of the research was completed in Phase IV (Culver Gilbert, & Trudel, 2003;
      Silverman & Skonie, 1997). Over 1,100 articles were reviewed, and 610 met the
      inclusion criteria. Selected findings include: (a) a relatively low mean spread
      across many journals, (b) a focus on coaching behavior using quantitative
      methodologies, and (c) a primary emphasis on team sports in school contexts.

AB  - The present study investigated aspects of moral development in sport, according
      to the form of participation, type of sport, and sport experience. 510
      participants, 14 to 49 years of age (M=24.9, SD=8.3) who came from organized
      competitive sports included athletes (n=327), referees (n=138), and coaches
      (n=45) in football (n = 161), handball (n = 198), and basketball (n = 150). Years
      of sport experience ranged from 1 to 6, 7 to 14, and 15 to 30 years of
      participation in sports. The Defining Issues Test was given; analysis showed no
      significant differences in development of moral reasoning among participants
      across different types of sports, forms of participation, and years of experience
      in sport.

PG  - 779-83
AB  - The polar sports tester made in Finland as one of the most widespread instruments
      in physical training is of importance for sports training. In this paper, we have
      developed a set of system for analysis of physical training workload using the
      measured data of the Polar Sports Tester, and have established a set of analysis 
      indices and reports of the physical training workload, including five categories 
      and 127 quantitative indices. It can reflect the distribution of physical
      workload and provide a series of parameters for coaches to direct scientific
      training and raise sport level.

TI  - Knowledge and perceptions of sport psychology within English soccer.
PG  - 813-26
AB  - The aim of the present study was to examine knowledge and perceptions of applied 
      sport psychology within English soccer. National coaches (n = 8), youth academy
      directors (n = 21) and academy coaches (n = 27) were surveyed using questionnaire
      and interview methods. Questionnaire results revealed a lack of knowledge of
      sport psychology that appeared to underpin some of the most significant barriers 
      to entry for sport psychologists. These included lack of clarity concerning the
      services of a sport psychologist, problems fitting in and players' negative
      perceptions of sport psychology. Overall, however, lack of finance was the
      highest rated barrier. Six barrier dimensions emerged from the interview data:
      negative perceptions of psychology, lack of sport psychology knowledge,
      integrating with players and coaching staff, role and service clarity, practical 
      constraints, and perceived value of sport psychology. These findings were broadly
      compatible with the survey data, with finance emerging as a major barrier and
      misconceptions of sport psychology being common. Our conclusions are discussed in
      relation to the practical implications of the study for both applied research and
      the provision of sport psychology services within English soccer.

TI  - Treating and avoiding herpes and tinea infections in contact sports.
PG  - 43-4
LID - 10.3810/psm.2004.10.1631 [doi]
AB  - Sports that require skin-to-skin contact between competitors, such as wrestling, 
      create environments where infections can spread. Skin screening checks are made
      before any wrestling competition, but this usually doesn't happen with other
      sports. Two of the most common skin infections are herpes gladiatorum (caused by 
      the same virus that causes cold sores) and tinea gladiatorum, also known as
      ringworm (caused by a fungus). These skin infections can spread rapidly among
      teammates, coaches, and opponents, so it is very important to treat the infection
      as soon as it is discovered. Athletes who have active skin infections can be
      disqualified from competition and withheld from practice.

TI  - New strategies for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of herpes simplex in 
      contact sports.
PG  - 277-83
AB  - Sports participation may result in myriad cutaneous manifestations, from mundane 
      findings to life-threatening illnesses. Skin infections are among the most common
      dermatologic ailments in athletes; herpes simplex is clearly among the most
      serious for the individual athlete, and ultimately the team. Herpes simplex
      infection most often involves athletes with extensive skin to skin contact. For a
      variety of reasons, wrestlers and rugby players seem particularly prone. The keys
      to thwarting epidemics and reducing an athlete's disqualification period include 
      early diagnosis, rapid institution of therapy, and routine systematic
      preventative measures. This clinical review examines the classification,
      epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of herpes simplex virus
      infection as it relates to contact sports. Attention to evidence-based medicine
      is paid to treatment and prevention techniques. Practical implications for all
      concerned parties, including athletes, parents, coaches, trainers, and
      physicians, are discussed.

TI  - Equipment innovations and rules changes in sports.
PG  - 272-6
AB  - Participation in competitive athletics carries an inherent risk for injury. The
      acceptable level of risk in certain sports is often a topic of considerable
      debate. The National Collegiate Athletic Association, and other sports governing 
      bodies, use injury surveillance and input from coaches, administrators,
      officials, athletes, and sports medicine experts in considering rules and
      equipment changes. Equipment innovations and/or equipment rules changes may
      decrease the risk of injury. However, equipment and rules changes can alter the
      essence or style of play of a particular sport, thus possibly increasing the risk
      of injury. This article discusses recent changes in equipment in various sports. 
      The reasons for change, controversy, and relevant research related to those
      changes are also reviewed.

      statements representing their treatment by coaches. African-American athletes
      rated their coaches significantly more negatively on these items. Implications
      for coaches lie in planning, design and evaluation of coaching behaviors by
      African-American athletes.

TI  - The Coach-Athlete Relationship Questionnaire (CART-Q): development and initial
      validation.
PG  - 245-57
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to develop and validate a self-report
      instrument that measures the nature of the coach-athlete relationship. Jowett et 
      al.'s (Jowett & Meek, 2000; Jowett, in press) qualitative case studies and
      relevant literature were used to generate items for an instrument that measures
      affective, cognitive, and behavioral aspects of the coach-athlete relationship.
      Two studies were carried out in an attempt to assess content, predictive, and
      construct validity, as well as internal consistency, of the Coach-Athlete
      Relationship Questionnaire (CART-Q), using two independent British samples.
      Principal component analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were used to reduce
      the number of items, identify principal components, and confirm the latent
      structure of the CART-Q. Results supported the multidimensional nature of the
      coach-athlete relationship. The latent structure of the CART-Q was underlined by 
      the latent variables of coaches' and athletes' Closeness (emotions), Commitment
      (cognitions), and Complementarity (behaviors).

TI  - [Cardiac arrhythmia in sports].
PG  - 420-5
AB  - Cardiac arrhythmias in athletes are frequent events in medical practice and
      require a profound diagnostic procedure. It is necessary to differentiate between
      harmless alterations of cardiac rhythm and potentially dangerous arrhythmias.
      While the former are mostly the result of an increased vagotone as a consequence 
      of endurance training, the latter are raising the question whether intensive
      physical and mental strains in competitive exercise are compatible with the
      cardiac arrhythmias diagnosed. Vagotone-induced alterations of cardiac
      arrhythmias generally disappear under exercise conditions. It is essential to
      include the type, intensity and duration of the athletic activities into the
      differential-diagnostic evaluations. However, those medical considerations
      frequently collide with economic interests. Sinus bradycardia is a typical
      example of vagotone-induced arrhythmias, which may be observed especially in
      highly endurance-trained athletes. Sinus bradycardias are mostly asymptomatic and
      rarely the cause of grave complications; therapeutic interventions are only
      required if clinical symptoms such as orthostatic disturbances are present. The
      different variants of cardiac conduction defects are-within certain limits-also
      frequently induced by an increased vagotone; generally, they require an intensive
      cardiologic diagnosis. Another frequent form of arrhythmias are ventricular
      extrasystoles. Their dignity may be assessed by exercise ECG. Disappearance under
      exercise conditions is, generally, a positive sign. Diagnosis and therapy of
      cardiac arrhythmias are based on the established guidelines. Additionally,
      regular cardiologic screenings are required in high-performance athletes of all
      age groups.

TI  - A literature review of sports-related orofacial trauma.
PG  - 270-80; quiz 281
AB  - This literature review evaluates the significance of dental injuries and their
      relationship to specific sports activities. Many studies have been published on
      individual sports or groups of sports but most pertain to specific age groups or 
      levels of competition. Research suggests that many sports that do not require
      mouthguards should encourage male and female participants to use orofacial
      protectors. Athletes, coaches, athletic directors, athletic trainers, parents,
      and members of the dental community should be aware of how individuals who
      participate in sporting activities are at risk for dental trauma. Any sport where
      the potential for dental trauma can exist (such as basketball, soccer, or
      wrestling) should consider utilizing mouthguards to protect the competitors. The 
      establishment of mouthguard programs for athletes of all ages, genders, and
      sports may help to reduce the incidence of dental trauma. A sports-related,
      orofacial/dental trauma reporting system is considered.

TI  - [Attention deficit hyperactivity syndrome and the capacity to practice sports].
PG  - 1001-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To know the sportive activities of children and adolescents, males,
      with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: There
      were studied 100 patients, all males, with ages ranging 6 to 16 years (average:
      9.28 years), 50 of the hospital and 50 of the private consultation. The subgroup 
      of ADHD was identified in all patients. The patients were asked on the sports
      most usually made, although the response had to be confirmed by the parents.
      RESULTS: Twenty-five cases showed attention deficit, 16 hyperactivity, and 59
      combined form. If only one sport is to have had in consideration, football was
      the most practiced sport, with 20 cases. If a second sportive activity was also
      considered, cycling was the most practiced sport, with 29 cases, while only 23
      patients played football (more than a 50% as goalkeeper) if we wanted the two
      first options. A less number of cases made basketball, swimming, judo or
      taekwondo, vasque ball and several others. Thirty three patients did not make any
      sport and most of them showed an unsporting attitude. Less than a half of the
      cases showed motivation to practice sport and less than a third was disciplined
      obeying the orders of the coach and/or the leader. CONCLUSION: The patients with 
      ADHD mostly show little motivation for the sport activities, being cycling and
      football (preferable as goalkeeper) the two most frequently practiced. The
      patients usually show little motivation and discipline.

PG  - 27-31
AB  - Growing participation of children in sports has resulted in an increased
      incidence of sports injuries. Although methodological differences in
      epidemiologic studies largely prevent precise comparisons, it appears that young 
      athletes participating in combat and contact sports seem to be more prone to
      injuries. Knee and ankle injuries are the most commonly encountered problems and 
      chronic events are more prevalent than acute ones. The occurrence of athletic
      injuries is multifactorial and may present differences with respect to sex and
      the sports branch involved. An analytical approach of all relevant groups
      (parents, coaches, physical education teachers, health personnel) is necessary to
      understand, treat, and prevent athletic injuries in children.

TI  - Extreme risk taker who wants to continue taking part in high risk sports after
      serious injury.
PG  - 337-9
AB  - The case is reported of a 40 year old male high risk sport athlete who had
      seriously injured himself several times and as a result was partially physically 
      disabled and had trouble with mental tasks requiring concentration such as
      spelling, reading numbers, and writing. The athlete was referred to a sports
      psychologist. In consultations, it became clear that he was having difficulty
      reconciling the difference between his life as it used to be and as it would be
      in the future. Part of his difficulty was dealing with the frustration and anger 
      "outbursts" which resulted from not being able to perform straightforward
      everyday motor skills. In spite of his injuries and disability, the patient badly
      wanted to continue participating in extreme sports. Reversal theory is used in
      the discussion to provide theoretical explanations of the motivation for his
      extreme risk taking behaviour.

PG  - 310-3
AB  - Although sports classification for cerebral palsy has been in use for several
      years, it is complicated both for training and for scoring. People with cerebral 
      palsy are difficult to fit into classification systems that are appropriate for
      other disability groups. The aim of this report is to describe the development of
      a framework for a simple quantitative classification of cerebral palsy. It was
      designed to be easily understood by all who are investigating, treating,
      training, coaching, and working with spastic disabled people. The scoring system 
      is accurate and quick, so long as the definitions of items listed are adhered to.

TI  - Effect of motivational climate on sportspersonship among competitive youth male
      and female football players.
PG  - 193-202
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of perceived
      motivational climate and gender on sportspersonship behavior of competitive youth
      football players. Participants were 512 boy and 202 girl Norwegian youth football
      players (12-14 years old) competing in an international football tournament. A 2 
      x 2 x 2 (gender, mastery climate high and low, performance climate high and low) 
      MANOVA produced no multivariate or interaction effects, but main effects for
      gender, performance climate, and mastery climate did emerge. Post hoc analyses of
      the simple main effects found that boys and girls were different in
      sportspersonship, but only in that boys were more sportspersonlike than girls on 
      one of the four sportspersonship dimensions. Players perceiving a high mastery
      climate endorsed sportspersonship more than those players perceiving a low
      mastery climate, and players perceiving a high performance climate were less
      likely to endorse sportspersonship than players perceiving a low performance
      climate. Canonical correlation analysis revealed that a strong mastery climate
      was positively associated with commitment, respect for social conventions, and
      respect for rules and officials. A strong performance climate was negatively
      associated with respect and concern for social conventions and respect for rules 
      and officials, while a positive association emerged for respect and concern for
      the opponent. The results of our study suggest that both boys and girls may well 
      perceive the coach emphasizing similar criteria of success and failure and
      thereby a similar culture of sportspersonship, while in general a strong mastery 
      climate leads to a higher sportspersonship orientation.

TI  - Coaching difference: a case study of 4 African American women student-athletes.
PG  - 242-51
AB  - The purpose of the present investigation was to describe the experiences of
      African American women student-athletes and the role that coaches play in those
      experiences. This study profiles 4 women who participated in National Collegiate 
      Athletic Association Division I cross-country, crew, track and field, and
      volleyball. Using data gathered through the qualitative methods of document
      analysis, background questionnaires, focus groups, grounded surveys, and in-depth
      individual interviews, the results of the study are focused on how coaches affect
      individual student-athletes and, most specifically, a particular segment of the
      athletic world that tends to be overlooked: the African American woman. Results
      are organized according to the following themes that emerged through the
      collection of data: (a) the involvement of coaches in African American women
      student-athletes' exposure to racism through stereotypes, (b) coaches as
      significant influences on African American women becoming involved and remaining 
      involved in sport, and (c) power structures in sport and society affecting
      African American women as a form of institutional racism. A practical
      applications section follows the results.

TI  - Sports performance graduate program interest and need survey: a brief report from
      the NSCA Education Committee.
PG  - 383-7
AB  - The Education Recognition Program (ERP) was developed to acknowledge academic
      institutions meeting departmental criteria established by the National Strength
      and Conditioning Association (NSCA) for having an area of concentration in
      undergraduate strength and conditioning. Since its inception, over 40
      universities have received recognition status. The NSCA is currently examining
      the interest, need, and feasibility of creating an ERP for graduate curriculum
      specific to sports performance. The current investigation included a survey of
      Division I, II, and III strength and conditioning professionals. Surveys were
      mailed to 215 coaches, of which 53 responded (26% rate of return). Five factors
      were extracted from the questionnaire and were subsequently named: Application of
      Science to Strength and Conditioning, Professional Development, Graduate
      Curriculum Support, Graduate Program Requirements, and Graduate Assistantships. A
      one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) found significant differences on Application
      of Science to Strength and Conditioning and Professional Development when
      comparing highest degree earned. Pairwise analysis indicated that individuals
      with Master's degrees scored those factors higher compared with individuals with 
      Bachelor's degrees. The results from this survey provide initial information from
      current strength and conditioning professionals regarding the interest and need
      for developing formalized graduate curriculum specifically for sports
      performance.

TI  - Tackling Rugby injury: lessons learned from the implementation of a five-year
      sports injury prevention program.
PG  - 74-84
AB  - Rugby Union football is a very popular sport in New Zealand but of all the major 
      sports played in that country, it has the highest reported incidence of injury.
      In 1995, a national rugby injury prevention program was instigated to address
      this problem. Known as Tackling Rugby Injury, this multifaceted program was
      implemented over a five-year period. The program was based on the results of a
      prospective cohort study of rugby injury, known as the Rugby Injury and
      Performance Project (RIPP), and was organised around seven themes, five relating 
      to the prevention of injury: coaching, fitness, injury management, tackling, and 
      foul play, and two relating to the implementation and evaluation of the program. 
      The purpose of this paper is to describe the lessons learned from the
      implementation of Tackling Rugby Injury. Qualitative research methods were used
      to describe the process of implementation, including informant interviews,
      participant observation, and the scrutiny of written, visual and archival
      material. Among the lessons learned were the importance of basing injury
      prevention strategies on scientific evidence rather than popular belief, the
      difficulty in implementing complex interventions, the advantages of a formal
      agreement between partners in the implementation of a program, the central role
      played by coaches in promoting injury prevention strategies, and the value of
      describing the process of implementation as well as monitoring injury outcomes
      and changes in knowledge, attitudes and behaviour. It is hoped that other sports 
      wishing to develop injury prevention programs can learn from this experience.

TI  - Evaluation of nutrition knowledge and dietary recommendations by coaches of

PG  - 222-35
AB  - The objectives of this study were to describe the dietary practices recommended
      by coaches working with adolescent athletes and to assess their nutritional
      knowledge. During a regional competition in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, 55
      coaches were interviewed. These coaches represented 22 cities with athletes
      enrolled in Olympic gymnastics, tennis, swimming, and judo events. A 3-section
      questionnaire was used to obtain data on demographic characteristics, dietary
      recommendations, and nutrition knowledge. Results showed that all coaches
      recommended general dietary practices during training, with no specific
      strategies for pre-, during-, and post-training periods. The main objectives of
      the recommendations for the training period were weight control and muscle mass
      gain. Deleterious weight control practices were recommended by 27% of the
      coaches. Specific dietary practices pre and post competition were recommended by 
      93% and 46% of the coaches, respectively. Participants responded correctly to 70%
      (SD = 3.2) of the nutrition knowledge questions, with no significant differences 
      (p =.61) between sports. The knowledge test identified a tendency to over-value
      proteins, excessively low-fat diets, and food myths. These findings indicate the 
      importance of developing strategies that will enhance the nutritional training of
      coaches.

TI  - Relation between sport and spatial imagery: comparison of three groups of
      participants.
PG  - 49-63
AB  - The literature suggests that sport may be considered a spatial activity and that 
      engaging in spatial activities increases the capacity of an individual to
      implement mental imagery. Moreover, mental rotation calls upon motor processes
      that are heavily involved in sporting activities. For these reasons, the authors 
      hypothesized that athletes ought to perform mental rotation tasks better than
      nonathletes. Also, athletes trained to react quickly to constantly changing
      environments should be faster at processing the information in a mental rotation 
      task than athletes operating in more settled environments. The results of this
      study show that athletes performed the mental rotation task significantly faster 
      than nonathletes. These results support the suggestion that there is a link
      between sport and the ability to perform mental image transformations; however,
      this ability may not be specific to the conditions in which the athlete performs.

TI  - Athletes' and coaches' perceptions of sport psychology services offered by
      graduate students at one NCAA Division I university.
PG  - 213-6
AB  - In recent years, there have been increasing calls for graduate programs in sport 
      psychology to include supervised practicum experiences. While supervision and
      applied experience is vital to the professional growth of graduate students,
      periodic evaluations are also needed to determine students' effectiveness in
      providing sport psychology services. This study represented an initial attempt to
      assess athletes' and coaches' perceptions of services provided by graduate
      students at one NCAA Division I university. Analyses showed 118 participants'
      ratings of consultants' effectiveness were comparable to those provided by U.S.
      Olympic athletes for professional consultants in earlier research by Gould,
      Murphy, Tammen, and May.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to examine the psychometric properties of
      the Coaching Efficacy Scale, which measures coaches' beliefs about their capacity
      to affect the learning and performance of their athletes on Game Strategy,
      Motivation, Teaching Technique, and Character Building. 230 Greek male team
      coaches (M = 37.6 yr. +/- 6.2) with 5.5 yr. (SD = 4.8) of experience completed
      the Greek translation of the scale. A first-order confirmatory factor analysis
      supported the basic factorial structure of the scale. Examination of a higher
      order model of an overall coaching efficacy factor showed satisfactory fit, using
      second-order confirmatory factor analysis. Moreover, the scale showed
      satisfactory Cronbach of of .82 and 30-day test-retest reliability of .73.
      Significant differences between experienced and less experienced coaches, defined
      by mean score, were found on Teaching Technique and overall self-efficacy
      factors, with more experienced coaches having significantly higher scores.
      Results supported the reliability and validity of the Greek version of the scale.

TI  - Treatment discrimination among assistant coaches of women's teams.
PG  - 455-66
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine organizational treatment discrimination 
      (i.e., when members of a group receive fewer rewards, opportunities, or resources
      than they legitimately deserve based on job-related criteria) in the context of
      women's athletics. Data were collected from 170 assistant coaches of women's
      teams (i.e., women's basketball, softball, track, volleyball, soccer, and
      tennis). Results indicate that women's perceived work experiences and outcomes
      were comparable, and sometimes better, than those of men. We present competing
      explanations for this finding. First, it is possible that these women were not
      subjected to treatment discrimination. Alternatively, it is possible that this
      demonstrates the existence of the "paradox of the contented working woman."
      Additional analyses indicate that work experiences explained a large portion of
      the variance in organizational commitment and turnover intentions, thereby
      demonstrating their importance in the workplace.

TI  - Moral issues in sport: the child's perspective.
PG  - 445-54
AB  - Sport offers opportunities for children to identify and resolve moral issues.
      Moral issues in sport have primarily been studied from the researcher's
      perspective, with the child's perspective relatively ignored. Thus, the purpose
      of this study was to explore the nature and content of the issues children
      experienced in sport. Interview participants consisted of 7 boys and 8 girls
      ranging in age from 10 to 12 years (M = 11.6 years, SD = 1.7) who had competitive
      youth sport experience. An inductive content analysis revealed that children
      identified issues surrounding three overall dimensions concerning fairness of
      adult's actions, negative game behaviors, and negative team behaviors. Specific
      examples of issues included unfair actions by coaches, disrespecting opponents,
      and selfish behavior in practice. The self-identified issues both confirmed and
      expanded upon the content found in hypothetical moral dilemmas in sport.

TI  - Asthma deaths during sports: report of a 7-year experience.
PG  - 264-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Asthma mortality and the mortality of athletes during sports have
      been described separately in detail in the medical literature. However, asthma
      has not been reported as a cause of death in competitive athletes. OBJECTIVE: The
      object of this study was to raise the awareness of physicians, coaches, trainers,
      and parents that children and adults can have fatal asthma exacerbations during
      and immediately after participating in sports. METHODS: The Temple Sports Asthma 
      Research Center identified athletes from 1993 until 2000 who died during or after
      sporting activity by using the nationwide Burrell's Information Service. Once a
      possible asthma-related sports death was identified, the autopsy report was
      requested from the coroner or medical examiner, and an attempt was made to
      contact the family. Contact with the family was limited to information about the 
      death, medical history, sports involvement, and any medication usage by the
      person who had died. Secondary sources, including news reports, were used to
      confirm whether the subject died of asthma during or immediately after a sporting
      activity. RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-three possible cases were identified.
      Sixty-one deaths met the criteria for study inclusion. White deaths outnumbered
      black deaths by 2 to 1. Deaths among male subjects predominated. Most subjects
      were younger than the age of 20 years, with the most prevalent age group being
      between 10 to 14 years old. Fifty-one percent (18 of 35) of the competitive
      athletes had their fatal event while participating in organized sport, 14 in a
      practice situation and 4 deaths during a game or meet setting. Basketball and
      track were the 2 most frequent activities performed at the time of the fatal
      event. CONCLUSION: The subjects who had fatal asthma exacerbations were usually
      white male subjects between the ages of 10 and 20 years. Mild intermittent or
      persistent asthma by history was commonly identified. Sudden fatal asthma
      exacerbations occur in both competitive and recreational athletes and can be
      precipitated by sporting activity.

TI  - Sports drug testing--an analyst's perspective.
PG  - 1-13
AB  - Sport plays a major role in the lives of many people, both for active
      participation and as entertainment. Sport is now a huge nationally and
      internationally based industry. The desire to win has led some athletes to resort
      to the use of performance enhancing drugs. With huge financial rewards now
      available in some sports the pressure to excel has grown. Some have argued that
      drug use should be given free rein, however most people are of the view that it
      is athletic prowess that should be applauded not the efficacy of various
      performance enhancing drugs. Apart from the obvious aspects of equality and fair 
      play, the use of drugs is associated with significant health risks. In the 1960's
      the use of stimulants in sports such as cycling led to the death of at least one 
      cyclist. Since 1968 the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has required all
      Olympic Games' host cities to provide laboratory facilities for the analysis and 
      detection of performance enhancing drugs. There are now 29 IOC accredited
      laboratories throughout the world that routinely test samples from athletes for
      the presence of such drugs. The purpose of this tutorial review is to give an
      overview of drug testing procedures, including those that were used at the last
      summer Olympic Games in Sydney 2000, and the incorporation of the latest
      developments in analytical chemistry technology in the drug testing process. More
      recently, developments in biotechnology mean that the use of whole new classes of
      drugs are banned in sport, often requiring new methodologies and techniques for
      their analysis. The contest between those who wish to cheat and those who wish to
      maintain fair play in sport is an ongoing one.

TI  - Epilepsy and sports participation.
PG  - 15-9
AB  - Epilepsy is a common disease found in 2% of the population, affecting both young 
      and old. Unfortunately, epileptics have previously been discouraged from
      participation in physical activity and sports for fear of inducing seizures or
      increasing seizure frequency. Despite a shift in medical recommendations toward
      encouraging rather than restricting participation, the stigma remains and
      epileptics continue to be less active than the general population. This results
      in increased body mass index, decreased aerobic endurance, poorer self-esteem,
      and higher levels of anxiety and depression. Although there are rare cases of
      exercise-induced seizures, studies have shown that physical activity can decrease
      seizure frequency, as well as lead to improved cardiovascular and psychologic
      health. The majority of sports are safe for epileptics to participate in with
      special attention to adequate seizure control, close monitoring of medications,
      and preparation of family, coaches, or trainers. Contact sports including
      football, hockey, and soccer have not been shown to induce seizures, and
      epileptics should not be precluded from participation. Water sports and swimming 
      are felt to be safe if seizures are well controlled and direct supervision is
      present. Additional care must be taken in sports involving heights such as
      gymnastics, harnessed rock climbing, or horseback riding. Sports such as
      hang-gliding, scuba diving, or free climbing are not recommended, given the risk 
      of severe injury or death, if a seizure were to occur during the activity. This
      article reviews the risks and benefits of physical activity in epileptics,
      discusses sports in which epileptics may participate, and addresses how to
      decrease possible risks for injury.

TI  - Dental and oral trauma and mouthguard use during sport activities in Israel.
PG  - 237-42
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the occurrence of oral and
      dental injuries in young Israeli population engaged in diverse sport activities. 
      The participants' awareness of the use of protective devices, such as
      mouthguards, during sport activities was also evaluated. A population of 943
      young adults, 95% males and 5% females (ages 18-19), was surveyed. A
      questionnaire was distributed relating to the type of sport activity practised,
      past oral and dental injuries over their lifetime, specifying the time and type
      of sports in which the injury occurred and the use and awareness of the
      protective devices. Of the total population examined, 850 (90%) were active in at
      least one type of sport, either as professionals or as amateurs. The analysis
      included the population that regularly participated in at least one sporting
      activity. The most commonly practised sports were soccer (54% of all active
      participants) and basketball (50%). The total number of dental and oral injuries 
      experienced during all sport activities was 229, affecting 27% of the
      participants of whom 73 (9%) suffered dental injuries. Most dental injuries
      occurred during the basketball and soccer training sessions and matches reaching 
      42 and 41% of the total number of injuries, respectively, and affected 7.2 and
      6.6% of the basketball and soccer players. Traumatic dental injuries in other
      sports occurred in less than 7% of the participants in these activities. Only 27%
      of the participants were aware of the protective devices, such as a mouthguards, 
      and only 3% actually used these devices. These results point to the high risk of 
      potential dental and oral injury during sport activities, the little knowledge
      about the benefits of using mouthguards and their limited utilization. The
      importance of public health education to increase the awareness of protective
      measures and devices and their actual use in Israel is the main focus. It should 
      be a combined duty of dentists and sports physicians and of the coaches to
      encourage the use of protective devices during training and games.

TI  - How valid is a self reported 12 month sports injury history?
PG  - 545-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: A past injury history is one of the most commonly cited risk factors 
      for sports injury. Often, injury history data are collected by self report
      surveys, with the potential for recall bias. OBJECTIVE: To assess the accuracy of
      a 12 month injury history recall in a population of 70 community level Australian
      football players. METHODS: The retrospective, self reported injury histories of
      70 community level Australian football players were compared with prospective
      injury surveillance records for the same 12 month period. The accuracy of the
      players' recall of the number of injuries, injured body regions, and injury
      diagnosis was assessed. RESULTS: Recall accuracy declined as the level of detail 
      requested increased. All players could recall whether or not they were injured
      during the previous year. Almost 80% were able to accurately recall the number of
      injuries and body regions injured, but not the diagnoses, whereas only 61% were
      able to record the exact number, body region, and diagnosis of each injury
      sustained. DISCUSSION: The findings of this study highlight the difficulty of
      using retrospectively collected injury data for research purposes. Any injury
      research relying on self reported injury history data to establish the relation
      between injury history and injury risk should consider the validity of the self
      report injury histories.

TI  - Training principles: evaluation of modes and methods of resistance training--a
      coaching perspective.
PG  - 79-103
AB  - Current information and evidence indicate that for most activities free weight
      training can produce superior results compared to training with machines,
      particularly when the free weight training involves complex, multi-joint
      exercises. A number of reasons can account for the superiority of free weights;
      the major factor deals with mechanical specificity. Mechanical specificity is
      concerned with appropriate movement patterns, force application and velocity of
      movement. Considering the available evidence that adherence to the concept of
      specificity of exercise and training can result in a greater transfer of training
      effect then free weights should produce a more effective training transfer.
      Therefore, the majority of resistance exercises making up a training programme
      should include of free weight exercises with emphasis on mechanical specificity
      (i.e. large muscle mass exercises, appropriate velocity, contraction type etc.). 
      Generally, machines should be used as an adjunct to free weight training and,
      depending upon the sport, can be used to a greater or lesser extent during
      various phases of the training period (preparation, pre-competition,
      competition).

TI  - Kinematic determinants of early acceleration in field sport athletes.
PG  - 144-50
AB  - Acceleration performance is important for field sport athletes that require a
      high level of repeat sprint ability. Although acceleration is widely trained for,
      there is little evidence outlining which kinematic factors delineate between good
      and poor acceleration. The aim of this study was to investigate the kinematic
      differences between individuals with fast and slow acceleration. Twenty field
      sport athletes were tested for sprint ability over the first three steps of a 15m
      sprint. Subjects were filmed at high speed to determine a range of lower body
      kinematic measures. For data analysis, subjects were then divided into relatively
      fast (n = 10) and slow (n = 10) groups based on their horizontal velocity. Groups
      were then compared across kinematic measures, including stride length and
      frequency, to determine whether they accounted for observed differences in sprint
      velocity. The results showed the fast group had significantly lower (~11-13%)
      left and right foot contact times (p < .05), and an increased stride frequency
      (~9%), as compared to the slow group. Knee extension was also significantly
      different between groups (p < .05). There was no difference found in stride
      length. It was concluded that those subjects who are relatively fast in early
      acceleration achieve this through reduced ground contact times resulting in an
      improved stride frequency. Training for improved acceleration should be directed 
      towards using coaching instructions and drills that specifically train such
      movement adaptations.

TI  - The coach-athlete relationship: a motivational model.
PG  - 883-904
AB  - The aim of this paper is to present a motivational model of the coach-athlete
      relationship that describes how coaches may influence athletes' motivation. In
      line with cognitive evaluation theory (Deci and Ryan, 1980, 1985) and the
      hierarchical model of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation (Vallerand, 1997, 2000),
      a motivational sequence is proposed where coaches' personal orientation towards
      coaching, the context within which they operate, and their perceptions of their
      athletes' behaviour and motivation influence coaches' behaviours. Also, coaches' 
      behaviours in the form of autonomy-supportive behaviours, provision of structure 
      and involvement have a beneficial impact on athletes' needs for autonomy,
      competence and relatedness, which, in turn, nurture athletes' intrinsic
      motivation and self-determined types of extrinsic motivation. Here, we first
      review coaches' autonomy-supportive behaviours. We then describe the
      psychological processes through which coaching behaviours have a positive
      influence on athletes' intrinsic and self-determined extrinsic motivation.
      Finally, we identify social and personality processes that determine coaching
      behaviours.

TI  - Development of an anaerobic capacity test for field sport athletes.
PG  - 275-84
AB  - Maximally accumulated oxygen deficit (MAOD) has been argued to be currently the
      best non-invasive method for estimating anaerobic capacity (Medbo et al., 1988,
      Ramsbottom et al., 1997). An easy to administer field test that could accurately 
      predict MAOD, would be of great use to many field sport athletes and coaches.
      Fifteen male rugby union players undertook MAOD testing (99.4 +/- 16.9ml x
      kg(-1)) on a treadmill using a modification of procedure 3 as described by Medbo 
      et al. (1988). All subjects also performed a 300m Shuttle Run Test (66.7 +/-
      2.2s), run over a 20m distance. Analysis of the MAOD and 300m Shuttle Run Test
      time relationship revealed a significant correlation of r = -0.69 [p<0.01).
      Furthermore, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that when subjects
      were split into 'good' and 'poor' groups based on 300m Shuttle Run Test times,
      the times distinguished between 'good' and 'poor' MAOD values (P<0.05). The
      findings of the present study support the validity of the 300m Shuttle Run Test
      as a useful estimate of anaerobic capacity in football athletes. Unexplained
      variance could be due to speed and agility factors associated with the 300m
      Shuttle Run Test. Methodological issues pertaining to the accurate assessment of 
      MAOD are also discussed.

PG  - 225-31
AB  - The purpose of this pilot study was to investigate the importance of the
      athlete's motor capabilities in success in sport. More precisely, the association
      of anthropometrical and physiological attributes, as well as motor abilities of
      elite basketball players with play elements of basketball. The subjects were
      seven elite basketball players. At the end of the competitive season, the
      anthropometrical and physiological features were measured to establish the
      physical fitness of the subjects. Both general and sport-specific motor tests
      were done. The coach estimated the performance of each player during the games of
      the competitive season. The coach's data sheet incorporated 14 parameters of the 
      game. Regression analyses indicated significant correlation between certain
      variables of the laboratory tests and the data of the coach's estimation
      statistics. Knowing these relationships provides us with valuable predictive
      information about player's capabilities in sport.

TI  - Prevention of pediatric sports injuries.
PG  - 337-43
AB  - With over 30 million children participating in sports each year across the United
      States, a number of significant injuries are to be expected. Although mild
      injuries such as strains, sprains, and contusions predominate, catastrophic
      injuries do occur. Young athletes are at an increased risk for growth plate and
      apophyseal injuries, overuse injuries, and heat illness. Many of these sports
      injuries can be prevented. Prevention strategies include protective equipment,
      rule changes, preseason and season prevention interventions, safety measures,
      better coaching, education, and a societal awareness of injury and prevention.
      This article discusses current injury prevention for children participating in
      baseball, football, soccer, and ice hockey.

TI  - Imagery use in elite youth sport participants: reinforcing the applied
      significance of achievement goal theory.
PG  - 292-300
AB  - This study examined the motivational profiles of elite youth athletes to
      determine whether individual differences in goal orientation corresponded with
      differential levels of imagery use. Two hundred ninety male (n = 88) and female
      (n = 202) young athletes (M = 16.6 years, SD = 1.48) completed the Perceptions of
      Success Questionnaire (POSQ, Roberts, Treasure, & Balague, 1998) to assess
      dispositional goal orientations and the Sport Imagery Questionnaire (Hall, Mack, 
      Paivio, & Hausenblas, 1998) to assess frequency and function of imagery use. A
      two-stage cluster analysis on the POSQ scores revealed a three-cluster solution
      with a multivariate analysis of variance indicating significant differences among
      cluster groups in imagery use. Athletes in Cluster 3 (higher task/higher ego)
      used significantly more imagery, regardless of the function than athletes in
      Cluster 1 (lower task/moderate ego) or Cluster 2 (moderate task/lower ego). These
      findings are discussed with reference to the role of achievement motivation in
      influencing young athletes' behavioral investments in mental strategies.

TI  - An audit of sports injuries in children attending an Accident & Emergency
      department.
PG  - 88-90
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the incidence of attendance, type of injury, sport involved 
      and management of sports injuries in children attending an Accident & Emergency
      (A&E) department. METHOD: Children, aged between 5-16 years, presenting with an
      injury related to sport, were studied over a period of three months. RESULTS:
      1858 children attended the A&E department during the three month period. 238
      (12.8%) were classified as sports injuries. Boys (71%) were injured more
      frequently than girls (29%). Injury rates in boys peaked at 14 years whereas in
      girls a peak occurred earlier at 12 years. Football was the most common sport
      implicated in injuries (39%). Rollerblading (14%), Rugby (8%), Basketball (7%)
      and Physical Education at school (7%) were the next most frequently involved
      sports. Soft tissue injuries dominated (61%). The upper limb was the most common 
      anatomical area injured (46%). Other injuries involved the lower limb (36%), head
      and neck (15%) and the trunk (3%). Injuries to the wrist were the most frequent
      presentation accounting for 30 fractures and 30 soft tissue injuries (25%). The
      majority of children were discharged from the A&E department after treatment
      (71%). 26% were reviewed at out-patient clinics and 3% required hospital
      admission. No children were referred for physiotherapy. CONCLUSION: Children
      participate in sport and can be injured. The majority of sports injuries
      presenting to an A&E department appear to be of a minor nature and could be
      managed with simple first aid techniques by parents, teachers and coaches at the 
      scene or by attending primary care in the first instance. Supervision of
      children, participation in organised sport and the use of protection devices may 
      help to prevent serious injury.

TI  - Immediate care of school sport injury.
PG  - 270-3
AB  - School sport is a major cause of injury in the post-primary age group. The
      importance of primary prevention in sport has been identified; however secondary 
      prevention of school related sport injury has not been described in Ireland. A
      random sample of 450 schools in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland was 
      studied using a postal questionnaire. Current management of sport injury, with
      particular interest in the expertise and training of teachers and coaches, was
      explored. Replies were received from 333 (74%) schools. There was no physical
      education teacher with up to date first aid training in 37% schools. Immediate
      care in terms of mechanisms and equipment to deal with injury was available in
      35%-81% of schools responding. Correct response ranged from 65%-90% to four
      scenarios: commonly presenting yet potentially serious management problems. This 
      study demonstrated deficiencies in sport injury care. In addition to concern
      about current training, a need for basic life support training is highlighted.
      These findings have implications for the prevention of school sports injuries.

TI  - The relevance of melatonin to sports medicine and science.
PG  - 809-31
AB  - The pineal hormone, melatonin, has widespread effects on the body. The aim of
      this review is to consider the specific interactions between melatonin and human 
      physiological functions associated with sport and exercise medicine. Separate
      researchers have reported that melatonin concentrations increase, decrease and
      remain unaffected by bouts of exercise. Such conflicting findings may be
      explained by inter-study differences in lighting conditions and the time of day
      the study participants have exercised. Age and fitness status have also been
      identified as intervening factors in exercise-mediated changes in melatonin
      concentration. The administration of exogenous melatonin leads to hypnotic and
      hypothermic responses in humans, which can be linked to immediate reductions in
      short-term mental and physical performance. Depending on the dose of melatonin,
      these effects may still be apparent 3-5 hours after administration for some types
      of cognitive performance, but effects on physical performance seem more
      short-lived. The hypothesis that the hypothermic effects of melatonin lead to
      improved endurance performance in hot environments is not supported by evidence
      from studies involving military recruits who exercised at relatively low
      intensities. Nevertheless, no research group has examined such a hypothesis with 
      athletes as study participants and with the associated more intense levels of
      exercise. The fact that melatonin has also been found to preserve muscle and
      liver glycogen in exercised rats adds weight to the notion that melatonin might
      affect endurance exercise in humans. Melatonin has been successfully used to
      alleviate jet lag symptoms of travellers and there is also a smaller amount of
      evidence that the hormone helps shiftworkers adjust to nocturnal regimens.
      Nevertheless, the symptoms of jet lag and shiftwork problems have primarily
      included sleep characteristics rather than performance variables. The few studies
      that have involved athletes and performance-related symptoms have produced
      equivocal results. Melatonin has also been found to be useful for treating some
      sleeping disorders, but interactions between sleep, melatonin and exercise have
      not been studied extensively with trained study participants. It is unknown
      whether melatonin plays a role in some exercise training-related problems such as
      amenorrhoea and over-training syndrome.

TI  - Rural sports and recreational injuries in Australia: what do we know?
PG  - 151-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: It is widely recognised that individuals residing in regional or rural
      areas have poorer health outcomes than those from metropolitan areas. Factors
      associated with these poorer health outcomes include geographical isolation,
      population declines, limited health care provision and higher levels of
      inactivity compared to urban areas. The mental, social and physical health of
      individuals and communities in rural areas can be improved through active
      participation in sport and recreation activities. Unfortunately, participation in
      such activities can potentially lead to injury. There is a suggestion that there 
      is an increased risk of sports injuries in rural areas due to the lack of health 
      professionals and coaching personnel, fewer available volunteers to organise and 
      deliver sport, and the general attitude towards injuries in rural settings.
      RESULTS: There is very limited information about the number and types of injuries
      sustained during participation in sports activities in rural and regional
      settings. This is largely related to a lack of formal sporting structures and
      support mechanisms including research funding and trained personnel. CONCLUSION: 
      A range of factors need to be implemented to improve safety for sporting and
      recreational participants in these areas. These include improved monitoring of
      injury occurrence, stronger promotion of safety initiatives and wider
      implementation of education strategies.

TI  - Catastrophic Head Injuries in High School and Collegiate Sports.
PG  - 312-315
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence of catastrophic head injuries in a variety
      of high school and college sports. DESIGN AND SETTING: Data on catastrophic head 
      injuries were compiled in a national surveillance system maintained by the
      National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury Research. The data were compiled
      with the assistance of coaches, athletic trainers, athletic directors, executive 
      officers of state and national athletic organizations, a national newspaper
      clipping service, professional associates of the researchers, and national sport 
      organizations. SUBJECTS: Data included all high school and college athletic
      programs in the United States. MEASUREMENTS: Background information on the
      athlete (age, height, weight, experience, previous injury, etc), accident
      information, immediate and postaccident medical care, type of injury, and
      equipment involved. Autopsy reports were used when available. RESULTS: A
      football-related fatality has occurred every year from 1945 through 1999, except 
      for 1990. Head-related deaths accounted for 69% of football fatalities, cervical 
      spinal injuries for 16.3%, and other injuries for 14.7%. High school football
      produced the greatest number of football head-related deaths. From 1984 through
      1999, 69 football head-related injuries resulted in permanent disability.
      Sixty-three of the injuries were associated with high school football and 6 with 
      college football. Although football has received the most attention, other sports
      have also been associated with head-related deaths and permanent disability
      injuries. From 1982 through 1999, 20 deaths and 19 permanent disability injuries 
      occurred in a variety of sports. Track and field, baseball, and cheerleading had 
      the highest incidence of these catastrophic injuries. Three deaths and 3 injuries
      resulting in permanent disability have occurred in female participants.
      CONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS: Reliable data collection systems and continual
      analysis of the data can help us to reduce the number of catastrophic
      head-related injuries. I include additional recommendations for injury
      prevention.

TI  - Standardized Mental Status Testing on the Sideline After Sport-Related
      Concussion.
PG  - 274-279
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The effects of concussion on mental status are often difficult to
      assess on routine clinical examination. I investigated the efficacy of
      standardized mental status testing on the sport sideline to detect abnormalities 
      that result from concussion and provide an objective measure of postinjury
      cognitive recovery. DESIGN AND SETTING: All subjects underwent a standardized
      preseason baseline mental status evaluation. Standardized testing of injured and 
      uninjured control subjects was repeated on the sideline immediately after
      concussion and 48 hours after injury. SUBJECTS: Sixty-three high school and
      collegiate football players with concussion and 55 uninjured control subjects
      were studied. MEASUREMENTS: The Standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC) was
      administered to evaluate neurocognitive functioning and neurologic status.
      RESULTS: Immediately after concussion, injured subjects performed significantly
      below preinjury baseline and below uninjured controls on the SAC. Measurable
      deficits in orientation, concentration, and memory were evident immediately after
      concussion. A decline in SAC score at time of injury was 95% sensitive and 76%
      specific in accurately classifying injured and uninjured subjects on the
      sideline. Injured subjects demonstrated significant improvements in SAC score 48 
      hours after injury. CONCLUSIONS: Standardized mental status testing can be a
      valuable tool to assist the sports medicine clinician in detecting the immediate 
      effects of concussion on mental status, tracking resolution of immediate
      postconcussive mental status abnormalities, and making more informed decisions on
      return to play after injury.

TI  - Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections among competitive sports
      participants--Colorado, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and Los Angeles County, 2000-2003.
PG  - 793-5
AB  - Although outbreaks of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) usually 
      have been associated with health-care institutions, MRSA is emerging as a cause
      of skin infections in the community. This report summarizes several reported
      clusters of skin and soft tissue infections associated with MRSA among
      participants in competitive sports and identifies possible risk factors for
      infection (e.g., physical contact, skin damage, and sharing of equipment or
      clothing). The findings underscore 1) the potential for MRSA infections among
      sports participants; 2) the need for health-care providers to be aware that skin 
      and soft tissue infections occurring in these settings might be caused by MRSA;
      and 3) the importance of implementing prevention measures by players, coaches,
      parents, and school and team administrators.

TI  - Psychosocial issues for children and adolescents with chronic illness:
      self-esteem, school functioning and sports participation.
PG  - 585-92
AB  - Self-esteem, school functioning, and sports participation are among the most
      significant psychosocial issues that affect children and adolescents with chronic
      illness. Although these capacities are essential components of development for
      all children, they present special concerns for children with limitations of
      health. Parents, teachers, and coaches play important roles in providing
      normalizing and gratifying opportunities for children who struggle to be
      competent and accepted by their peers. Much can be done to provide chronically
      ill children with experiences and support that will allow them to grow up
      happier, feel better about themselves, and enjoy more success.

TI  - Sport specific performance diagnosis in rowing: an incremental graded exercise
      test in coxless pairs.
PG  - 428-32
AB  - The aim of the present study was to develop and validate an incremental graded
      exercise test performed in the rowing boat(coxless pair) in order to give
      specific performance evaluation data. Furthermore, an attempt was made to
      transfer these data to training recommendations. Thirty-four female rowers of
      national and international level performed a 4 x 6 min incremental graded
      exercise test GXT(boat) in coxless pairs on a lake (6 km, no wind, no waves). The
      boat velocity on the water (V; measured by a speedometer PACE COACH) was
      increased continuously from 3.55 m x s-I to 4.03 m x s-1. The individual
      anaerobic threshold(IAT) was determined by means of the lactate (LA) kinetics
      during and after exercise. Within 28 days all subjects performed arowing
      ergometry test GXT(ergo); Gjessing rowing ergometer: 40 watts increments every 3 
      min) as well as 70 min of constant endurance training in the boat in moderate
      velocity (ET; n- 10 pairs because of changing weather conditions). Results for
      V/LAIHR at IAT are: GXT(boat): 3.84+/- 0.10 m x s-1/2.44 +/- 0.66 mmol x 1-1/172 
      + 11 min(-1); GXT(ergo): 206+/-10 watts/2.53 +0.40 mmol x 1-171 +/- 10 min-'
      (means+/-SD). The Spearman rank order test showed significant correlations for HR
      (p < 0.001) and the mean performances of the coxless pairs (p < 0.05). A'5 %
      lower V during ET lead to a 10% lower HR and a 30% lower LA compared to the
      values at IAT. In conclusion, both a performance specific evaluation and velocity
      oriented control of training are possible by means of a 4 x 6 min incremental
      graded exercise test in coxlesspairs. However, this test on the water requires
      almost perfect weather conditions. The HR recommendations based on GXT (ergo)
      were confirmed during GXT(boat).

TI  - The hypnotic belay in alpine mountaineering: the use of self-hypnosis for the
      resolution of sports injuries and for performance enhancement.
PG  - 45-51
AB  - The author, an experienced alpine mountaineer, sustained several traumatic
      climbing injuries over a two-year period. This article describes her multiple
      uses of self-hypnosis to deal with several challenges related to her returning to
      successful mountain climbing. She used self-hypnosis for physical healing and to 
      enhance her motivation to resume climbing. While training for her next
      expedition, she successfully utilized self-hypnotic techniques to deal with acute
      stress and later post-traumatic symptoms that had emerged related to her climbing
      injuries. She describes her use of hypnotic ego-strengthening, mental rehearsal, 
      age progression, and "Inner Strength" as well as active-alert trance states. Her 
      successful summitting of Ecuador's Cotopaxi at 19,380 feet was facilitated by
      "The Hypnotic Belay" which permitted her to secure herself by self-hypnosis in
      addition to the rope used to secure climbers. In 1994, the author returned to the
      Cascade Mountains where she had been injured three years earlier and reached the 
      summit of Mount Shuksan. This time she was secured by "The Hypnotic Belay".

TI  - On-field predictors of neuropsychological and symptom deficit following
      sports-related concussion.
PG  - 222-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Investigate the relationship between on-field markers of concussion
      severity and postinjury neuropsychological and symptom presentation in an
      athlete-specific population. DESIGN: Case control study. SETTING: Multicenter
      analysis of high school and college athletes. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 78
      athletes sustaining sports-related concussion were selected from a larger sample 
      of 139 concussed athletes. ASSESSMENT OF PREDICTOR VARIABLES: On-field presence
      of disorientation, posttraumatic amnesia, retrograde amnesia, and loss of
      consciousness. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: ImPACT, a computerized neuropsychological
      test battery, was administered pre-season and, on average, 2 days postinjury.
      Good postinjury presentation (n = 44) was defined as no measurable change,
      relative to baseline, in terms of both ImPACT memory and symptom composite
      scores. Poor presentation (n = 34) was defined as a 10-point increase in symptom 
      reporting and 10-point decrease in memory functioning (exceeding the 80%
      confidence interval for measurement error on ImPACT). Athletes failing to meet
      good or poor selection criteria (n = 61) were not included in the analysis.
      RESULTS: Odds ratios revealed that athletes demonstrating poor presentation at 2 
      days postinjury were over 10 times more likely (P < 0.001) to have exhibited
      retrograde amnesia following concussive injury when compared with athletes
      exhibiting good presentation. Similarly, athletes with poor presentation were
      over 4 times more likely (P < 0.013) to have exhibited posttraumatic amnesia and 
      at least 5 minutes of mental status change. There were no differences between
      good and poor presentation groups in terms of on-field loss of consciousness.
      CONCLUSIONS: The presence of amnesia, not loss of consciousness, appears
      predictive of symptom and neurocognitive deficits following concussion in
      athletes. Athletes presenting with on-field amnesia should undergo comprehensive 
      and individualized assessment prior to returning to sport participation.
      Continued refinement of sports concussion grading scales is warranted in lieu of 
      consistent findings that brief loss of consciousness is not predictive of
      concussion injury severity.

TI  - Parental influence on sport participation in elite young athletes.
PG  - 250-5
AB  - AIM: To ascertain how talented young British swimmers, gymnasts, tennis and
      soccer players are introduced to their sport, and to identify how they are
      encouraged into intensive systematic training. METHODS: Two hundred and
      eighty-two elite young athletes (aged 8 to 17 yrs) and their parents were
      interviewed in their homes to identify how and why they started intensive
      training. RESULTS: Of the 4 sports studied (soccer, gymnastics, tennis, and
      swimming), parents of swimmers were more likely introduce their children to the
      sport (70%), while parents of gymnasts (42%) were the least likely to do so.
      However, in this sports parents played a lesser role in the transition to
      intensive training (6% and 5%, respectively). Nearly half the soccer players
      (47%) became involved in the sport because of their own interest, with the
      majority making the transition to intensive training because of encouragement by 
      a coach (65%). Self-motivation (27%) and parental influence (57%) brought
      children into tennis with 25% of the young athletes in the sample autonomously
      deciding to start intensive training. Children from the lower socio-economic
      classes were underrepresented, and the total number of 1-parent families (5.3%)
      was considerably less than current British national norms (16.1%). CONCLUSION: In
      Britain, young athletes' involvement in high level sport is heavily dependent on 
      their parents, with sports clubs and coaches playing an important later role. In 
      the present socio-economic and cultural situation, many talented youngsters with 
      less motivated parents will not undertake sport. Talented youngsters from a
      poorer economic background will be heavily disadvantaged, especially in sports
      such as tennis.

TI  - Prevention of knee injuries in sports. A systematic review of the literature.
PG  - 165-79
AB  - AIM: We reviewed evidence regarding risk factors associated with incidence of
      knee injuries both to assess the effectiveness of prevention strategies, and to
      offer evidence-based recommendations to physicians, coaches, trainers, athletes, 
      and researchers. METHODS: We searched electronic data bases without language
      restriction for the years 1966 - September 1, 2001, identified citations from
      reference sections of research papers retrieved, contacted experts in the field, 
      and searched the Cochrane Collaboration. Of the 328 citations identified, we
      emphasized the results from the 13 reports that compared alternative methods to
      prevent knee injury and assessed the methodologic quality of these reports using 
      a standardized instrument. RESULTS: Five studies addressed the effectiveness of
      bracing in football players; these studies showed no consistent evidence of
      benefit. Two studies comparing alternative cleat designs and a controlled study
      testing the effects of adjustments in the ski boot/binding system were difficult 
      to interpret because of inadequate reporting of methodology. Six prospective
      studies that addressed the impact of conditioning and training showed promise of 
      proprioception and neuromuscular training for protection against knee injury. We 
      identified serious flaws in study design, control of bias, and statistical
      methods; the median quality scores ranged from 11 to 56 (out of 100). CONCLUSION:
      Structured training programs that emphasize neuromuscular and proprioceptive
      training offer encouraging evidence for the prevention of knee injuries. However,
      flaws in study design and implementation have limited the effectiveness of work
      in this field. A rigorously implemented research program is needed to address
      this critically important sports medicine problem.

TI  - Acute and long-term management of sports-related closed head injuries.
PG  - 559-76
AB  - Aggressive participation in athletics is rewarded in many ways in our society. As
      long as there is such strong impetus for participation in athletics, the risks of
      head injuries for participants will remain. Important strides made in
      understanding of the pathophysiology of head injuries may lead to improved
      treatment strategies in the future. In light of the current lack of effective
      therapies, however, the best options remain injury prevention, early and
      appropriate recognition, and limitation of subsequent, further injury. Frequently
      the medical staff is encouraged to allow the athlete to return to play based on
      the desires of the coach, team, fans, parents, and even the athlete himself. A
      thorough understanding of the potentially serious risks of repetitive injury,
      however, mandates that only a proper conservative period of observation and
      evaluation will best serve the competitor.

TI  - Knowledge and attitudes of coaches of secondary school athletes in Ibadan,
      Nigeria regarding oro-facial injuries and mouthguard use by the athletes.
PG  - 204-8
AB  - - The objective of this study was to assess the perceptions of secondary school
      sports' coaches about oro-facial injuries and mouth protector usage in sports by 
      the adolescent athletes. A 10-item, self-completion questionnaire was distributed
      to 42 coaches from 23 secondary schools randomly selected from different parts of
      Ibadan city in Nigeria between May and June, 2002. The questionnaire sought
      information on why a mouth protector (mouthguard) is used, when it is required;
      the types of mouth protector used, the major reasons for choosing a specific
      mouth protector, and personal feeling as to whether mouthguards prevent oral
      injury. Descriptive statistics were used for the data while the chi-square
      statistic was employed to test the significance of association between variables.
      All the coaches, 25 (59.5%) males and 17 (40.5%) females with age range of 19-51 
      years and mean age of 38.07 +/- 8.97 years (mean +/- SD), completed and returned 
      the forms (100% completion rate). 95.2% of the coaches believed that mouthguards 
      prevent oral injuries and 95.2% of them also would like more information on
      different types of mouthguard, while 4.8% each felt otherwise. The main factor
      determining the choice of the type of mouthguard for athletes by the coaches was 
      the quality of oral protection (57.1%), and the next was the cost (23.8%).
      Acceptance of mouthguard was scored as positive by 88.1% of the athletes. 81.0%
      of the coaches felt that mouthguard should be worn at all times (during practices
      and competitions) while 19.0% would prefer the use during competitions only. The 
      majority of the coaches (71.4%) believed that boxing needs mouthguards, 2.4% each
      indicated football (soccer) and Judo while 11.9% of the coaches did not indicate 
      any sport. The majority of these Nigerian coaches agreed on the protective
      effectiveness of mouthguard against sport-related oro-facial injuries, but they
      are yet to be adequately informed about mouthguards generally so as to correctly 
      advise and influence these adolescent athletes in this regard.

TI  - Minor traumatic brain injury in sports.
PG  - 323-6
AB  - Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) is an all-too-frequent occurrence among
      amateur and professional athletes alike. The increased attention it has received 
      in recent literature may suggest that incidence of this injury has risen. The
      frequency of MTBI in general may be rising with the increased interest in
      so-called noncontact sports such as soccer, snowboarding, skateboarding, and
      motocross. Despite significant improvements made in the quality of protective
      equipment, head injury remains common in football, soccer, and amateur boxing.
      The management of athletes who suffer traumatic head injury remains problematic
      for coaches, trainers, team physicians, primary care physicians, and neurologic
      specialists. This article addresses guidelines, and diagnostic and treatment
      protocols to help with the management of athletes with concussion and traumatic
      head injuries.

TI  - A survey of the scientific data and training methods utilized by collegiate
      strength and conditioning coaches.
PG  - 368-73
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which scientific
      research influences college strength and conditioning coaching practices and to
      determine the training methods utilized. A total of 321 surveys were mailed to
      Division I strength and conditioning coaches, and the response rate was 42.7%
      (137 of 321 surveys). Results indicate that all subjects held a baccalaureate
      degree, the majority in a human performance-related field, and that 75% were
      Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist (CSCS) certified. The respondents'
      most widely utilized professional resources were the Strength and Conditioning
      Journal (94%) and other collegiate coaches and programs (93%). Forty-seven
      percent of respondents indicated that other collegiate coaches and their programs
      were the most important sources of knowledge outside of formal education. The
      majority indicated that they used a periodization protocol (93%) utilizing
      multiple sets (97%), plyometrics (90%), explosive movements (88%), and Olympic
      lifts (85%). Respondents tend to rely on sources of information that may not be
      defined as scientific, as evidenced by the low priority given to peer-reviewed
      literature. Respondents also tend to employ the methods they utilized as
      athletes. Reliance on these sources may not take advantage of advances made
      through scientific research in exercise physiology, biomechanics, and more
      specifically the area of strength and conditioning.

TI  - Computer-based assessment of sports-related concussion.
PG  - 42-7
AB  - Sports-related concussion has received considerable attention from
      neuropsychologists, athletic trainers, team coaches, physicians, families, and
      athletes. In this context, researchers have recently developed computer programs 
      for the assessment of sports-related concussion. Computer-based assessment of
      sports-related concussion saves time, allows for team baseline testing, and can
      be easily incorporated into the sports medicine environment. This article reviews
      the advantages and limitations of computer-based assessment of sports-related
      concussion. Within a well-coordinated concussion management program that includes
      input from a neuropsychologist, computer-based assessment of sports-related
      concussion will soon be the most common approach for assessing concussion in
      athletes.

TI  - Clinical outcome and return to sport after the surgical treatment of
      spondylolysis in young athletes.
PG  - 244-9
AB  - We studied prospectively 22 young athletes who had undergone surgical treatment
      for lumbar spondylolysis. There were 15 men and seven women with a mean age of
      20.2 years (15 to 34). Of these, 13 were professional footballers, four
      professional cricketers, three hockey players, one a tennis player and one a
      golfer. Preoperative assessment included plain radiography, single
      positron-emission CT, planar bone scanning and reverse-gantry CT. In all patients
      the Oswestry disability index (ODI) and in 19 the Short-Form 36 (SF-36) scores
      were determined preoperatively, and both were measured again after two years in
      all patients. Three patients had a Scott's fusion and 19 a Buck's fusion. The
      mean duration of back pain before surgery was 9.4 months (6 to 36). The mean size
      of the defect as determined by CT was 3.5 mm (1 to 8) and the mean preoperative
      and postoperative ODIs were 39.5 (SD 8.7) and 10.7 (SD 12.9), respectively. The
      mean scores for the physical component of the SF-36 improved from 27.1 (SD 5.1)
      to 47.8 (SD 7.7). The mean scores for the mental health component of the SF-36
      improved from 39.0 (SD 3.9) to 55.4 (SD 6.3) with p < 0.001. After rehabilitation
      for a mean of seven months (4 to 10) 18 patients (82%) returned to their previous
      sporting activity.

      different sporting purposes with and without recurrent airway obstruction.
PG  - 288-92
AB  - Tidal breathing flow-volume loop (TBFVL) indices in healthy horses and in horses 
      suffering from mild and moderate to severe recurrent airway obstruction (RAO)
      were measured. In addition, the ability of these indices to differentiate healthy
      controls from horses with mild RAO by separating the horses according to their
      usage was investigated. The horses were assigned to three sporting categories: 1 
      Leisure horses; 2 Horses competing at events with a duration of more than five
      minutes (eventing, coaching and endurance); and 3 Horses competing at events with
      a duration of less than five minutes (dressage and show jumping). Flow-volume
      curves were recorded with an ultrasonic spirometer and TBFVL indices were
      calculated with specially dedicated software. The sporting usage of the horses
      had a significant effect on the differentiating ability of TBFVL indices in
      diagnosing different degrees of RAO. The index TIF50 differentiated control
      horses from horses with minor RAO in all sporting categories.

TI  - [Competitiveness in sports activities of the psychiatrically disabled].
PG  - 1242-8
AB  - In 2002, psychiatrically disabled athletes joined an historic first open game of 
      volleyball at the national sports games for the disabled. Compared to the
      competitive sports and Paralympic Games that physically and intellectually
      disabled athletes have participated in, activities for the psychiatrically
      disabled have not been well-organized. In this paper, we examine a number of
      problems that have arisen when the psychiatrically disabled joined competitive
      sports games. We identify two major characteristics of the psychiatrically
      disabled of particular relevance when organizing competitive sports activities.
      First, all psychiatrically disabled athletes need treatment of their individual
      diseases. For example, psychiatric symptoms fluctuate markedly over time, unlike 
      physical or intellectual disabilities, whose symptoms are much more stable.
      Exacerbations of psychiatric illness are also likely to occur due to the stresses
      of competitiveness. Second, psychiatric disabilities are manifestations of
      disorders in the central nervous system, which makes the classification of
      psychiatric disabilities less straightforward than classification of the
      physically disabled. These two characteristics require special attention when
      organizing competitive athletic challenges that include the psychiatrically
      disabled. However, promoting sports activities that include the psychiatrically
      disabled would be expected to reduce the prejudice toward and subsequent social
      disadvantages experienced by psychiatric patients. Thus, with careful planning to
      successfully integrate psychiatrically disabled athletes, we expect increased
      promotion of such sports activities in the future.

TI  - Nurturing sport expertise: factors influencing the development of elite athlete.
PG  - 1-9
AB  - The development of expertise in sport is the result of successful interaction of 
      biological, psychological, and sociological constraints. This review examines the
      training and environmental factors that influence the acquisition of sport
      expertise. Research examining the quality and quantity of training indicate that 
      these two elements are crucial predictors of attainment. In addition, the
      possession of resources such as parental support and adequate coaching are
      essential. Social factors such as cultural influences and the relative age effect
      are also considered as determinants of sport expertise. Although it is evident
      that environmental factors are essential to the acquisition of high levels of
      sport development, further research is clearly required.

TI  - [Frequency and nature of anterior tooth injuries and the use of mouth protectors 
      in sports clubs in Bern].
PG  - 20-6
AB  - Tooth injuries are frequently associated with sports injuries. Most of them could
      be minimized or prevented by the use of a mouthguard. The present study
      investigated the occurrence of tooth injuries and the attitude of athletes of
      Bernese sports clubs towards mouthguards, by means of a questionnaire and
      clinical examination. A total of 172 out of 200 athletes from six sports clubs,
      who were contacted directly at the sports fields, returned the questionnaire.
      Fifty of them owned a mouthguard (= 29.1%) and 54 reported having suffered dental
      trauma. The majority of athletes did not wear a mouthguard, despite acknowledging
      its usefulness. Even after a dental injury, the rate of mouthguard-acceptance
      increased just marginally; only 38.9% of all injured athletes were wearing a
      mouthguard after dental trauma. Most of the athletes had not considered wearing a
      mouthguard at all. For many of them, impairment of speech and breathing and
      discomfort were reasons not to wear a mouthguard. Of the 54 reported athletes
      with dental trauma, 48 were examined clinically. The upper central incisors were 
      by far the most frequently injured teeth. The clinical examination used an injury
      severity index (NIDR-Index, National Institute of Dental Research) ranging from
      grade 0 (no visible damage), to grade 6 (loss of tooth). The most common finding 
      was grade 4 (injuries that were treated by reconstruction). In conclusion there
      is a need to optimize information for athletes concerning mouthguards and sports 
      injuries. Providing such information is not only the responsibility of coaches
      and trainers, but also of dentists.

TI  - Relation between sport activity and mental rotation: comparison of three groups
      of subjects.
PG  - 1141-54
AB  - The aim was to observe the relation between sport activity and performance on a
      mental image-transformation task. A classical mental rotation task using abstract
      stimuli was administered to three groups: (a) gymnasts who used mental and
      physical rotations in their practice, (b) athletes whose activities required very
      little motor rotation, and (c) nonathletes. Both sport groups performed similarly
      and obtained significantly shorter response times than those of the nonathletes. 
      We suggest that the regular practice of spatial activities, such as sports, could
      be related to the spatial capacities of the participants.

TI  - Life in a secure unit: the rehabilitation of young people through the use of
      sport.
PG  - 531-50
AB  - Sport is used widely in the rehabilitation of British young people who are
      resident in secure facilities following criminal sentencing, during remand or for
      welfare reasons. The research uses a quasi-longitudinal observational study in a 
      secure unit, located in Southern England, and questions the suitability of
      sporting activities used as a primary vehicle for, and mechanism of,
      rehabilitation. Through the analysis of experiences at the unit, the paper
      supports the use of those sporting activities which de-emphasise regulations and 
      winning, and argues for an emphasis on choice for participants, the tailoring of 
      programmes to suit individual needs, and on positive feedback. Sport evidently
      has an important role in youth rehabilitation. However, it should be used
      selectively because, if unsuitable activities and programmes are used, they may
      have a detrimental effect on participants. The paper demonstrates the usefulness 
      of qualitative research methods in rehabilitation studies.

AB  - Preventing infectious disease in sports is fundamental to maintaining team
      effectiveness and helping individual athletes avoid the adverse effects of
      illness. Good general hygiene practices, immunization, efforts to minimize
      exposure to specific diseases, and certain prophylactic measures are essential.
      Teammates, coaches, athletic trainers, officials, and healthcare providers should
      actively participate in these preventive efforts, and community public health
      resources may be involved when appropriate. In addition to treating individual
      athletes, the team physician's role is to increase awareness, vigilance, and
      compliance with procedures to prevent the spread of disease.

TI  - Assessment of cognitive recovery following sports related head trauma in boxers.
PG  - 21-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To prospectively examine recovery of cognitive function within one
      month following subconcussive sports related head trauma. DESIGN: A prospective
      study of New York State licensed professional boxers who underwent testing of
      cognitive functioning before and after (within days, one week, and one month) a
      professional bout. SETTING: Male professional athletes recruited from the New
      York State Athletic Commission and local boxing gyms. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-six
      licensed professional boxers were enrolled in the protocol. Data is presented on 
      the 18 participants who completed testing on at least three of the four time
      points. INTERVENTIONS: Serial neuropsychological assessment before and after the 
      athletes engaged in competition. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Neuropsychological
      measures of cognitive functioning, including new learning and memory, information
      processing speed, and mental flexibility. RESULTS: A series of repeated measures 
      MANOVAS revealed significant within subject differences across testing on complex
      information processing and verbal fluency. Post hoc analyses indicated
      significant differences between time 1 (baseline) and time 4 (one month post),
      with scores one month following the bout indicating significantly improved
      performance. Memory scores did not change significantly across testing; however, 
      prior boxing exposure measured by total number of professional bouts was
      associated with poorer memory performance. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive testing one
      month following participation in a professional boxing bout yielded scores
      suggestive of recovery to a level above the baseline. We conclude that baseline
      assessment taken during periods of intense training are likely confounded by
      other pre-bout conditions (i.e., sparring, rapid weight loss, pre-bout anxiety)
      and do not represent true baseline abilities. Instability of performance
      associated with mild head injury may complicate the interpretation of post-injury
      assessments. Practice effects may also confound the interpretation of serial
      assessments, leading to underestimation of the effects of sports related head
      trauma. Poorer cognitive performance was evident during the presumed recovery
      period in boxers with greater exposure to the sport (>12 professional bouts).
      This finding is consistent with reports of a cumulative effect of repetitive head
      trauma and the subsequent development of chronic traumatic brain injury. These
      data have implications for assessing recovery of function following head injury
      in players of other contact sports as well as determination of return-to-play
      following an injury.

TI  - Sport psychology service delivery: staying ethical while keeping loose.
PG  - 12-8
AB  - Although the parent discipline of sport psychology is psychology, the delivery of
      sport psychology services has its main roots in physical education and sports
      science (motor learning and control, skill acquisition). Thus, sport
      psychologists may look more like coaches than they look like clinicians or
      counselors. In this article, the authors trace the evolution of sport psychology 
      services and contrast the temporal, spatial, and delivery issues of applied sport
      psychology with more mainstream counseling and clinical psychology. The looser
      boundaries of sport psychologist practice have both benefits and dangers, and the
      authors offer some examples to professional psychologists who are thinking of
      expanding their delivery of service to athletes and coaches.

TI  - Intrinsic-extrinsic factors in sport motivation.
PG  - 459-76
AB  - Participants were 83 students (36 men and 47 women). 10 intrinsic-extrinsic
      factors involved in sport motivation were obtained. The factors were generated
      from items obtained from the participants rather than items from the
      experimenter. This was done to avoid the possible influence of preconceptions on 
      the part of the experimenter regarding what the final dimensions may be. Obtained
      motivational factors were Social Reinforcement, Fringe Benefits, Fame and
      Fortune, External Forces, Proving Oneself, Social Benefits, Mental Enrichment,
      Expression of Self, Sense of Accomplishment, and Self-enhancement. Each factor
      was referred to an intrinsic-extrinsic dimension to describe its relative
      position on that dimension. The order of the factors as listed indicates
      increasing intrinsic motivation. i.e., the first four factors were rated in the
      extrinsic range, whereas the remaining six were rated to be in the intrinsic
      range. Next, the participants rated the extent to which each of the various
      factors was involved in their decision to participate in sport activities. The
      pattern of use of the motivational factors was the same for both sexes except
      that men indicated greater use of the Fringe Benefits factor. Overall, the more
      intrinsic a sport motivation factor was rated, the more likely it was to be rated
      as a factor in actual sport participation.

TI  - Task familiarity and task efficacy: a study of sports coaches.
PG  - 367-72
AB  - The purpose of the study was to establish a profile of coaching efficacy with
      Hong Kong community coaches who differ in knowledge and hours spent in coaching. 
      Coaching efficacy can be described in four dimensions, namely, Motivation,
      Strategy, Technique, and Character Building. It was hypothesized that coaches who
      had spent more time coaching and were more knowledgeable about the sport and
      coaching would score higher on those four dimensions of a Coaching Efficacy
      Scale. The scale was administered to 252 coaches working with beginning and
      district-level athletes in a variety of sports. Analysis suggested that their
      self-reported efficacy on Strategy was least strong. This means that the coaches 
      were not confident in analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of opposing teams,
      making decisions on the type of game strategy to employ, and maximizing athletes'
      strength in competitions. Coaches with less coaching experience were also less
      confident about motivating athletes. This information on coaching efficacy may be
      useful in deciding content for a program of education for coaching.

TI  - Canadian coaches' perceptions of the 1980 Olympic boycott.
PG  - 68-70
AB  - This paper examined Canadian coaches' perceptions of the 1980 boycott of the
      Moscow Olympic Games and effects on their lives and coaching careers, gathered by
      in-depth telephone interviews with 24 coaches of the Olympic team. Most of the 25
      interview questions were asked earlier of athletes and now rephrased for coaches.
      In general, the coaches were more concerned about the welfare of their athletes
      than themselves, directing their energy towards helping their athletes cope with 
      the boycott and, in some cases, to prepare for alternate competitions. The
      coaches' reactions were more subdued than those of the Canadian athletes affected
      by the boycott.

TI  - Temporal pattern analysis and its applicability in sport: an explanation and
      exemplar data.
PG  - 845-52
AB  - Quantitative analysis of sports performance has been shown to produce information
      that coaches can use within the coaching process to enhance performance.
      Traditional methods for quantifying sport performances are limited in their
      capacity to describe the complex interactions of events that occur within a
      performance over time. In this paper, we outline a new approach to the analysis
      of time-based event records and real-time behaviour records on sport performance 
      known as T-pattern detection. The relevant elements of the T-pattern detection
      process are explained and exemplar data from the analysis of 13 soccer matches
      are presented to highlight the potential of this form of analysis. The results
      from soccer suggest that it is possible to identify new profiles for both
      individuals and teams based on the analysis of temporal behavioural patterns
      detected within the performances.

TI  - Technique analysis in sports: a critical review.
PG  - 813-28
AB  - This paper critically reviews technique analysis as an analytical method used
      within sports biomechanics as a part of performance analysis. The concept of
      technique as 'a specific sequence of movements' appears to be well established in
      the literature, but the concept of technique analysis is less well developed.
      Although several descriptive and analytical goals for technique analysis can be
      identified, the main justification given for its use is to aid in the improvement
      of performance. However, the conceptual framework underpinning this process is
      poorly developed with a lack of distinction between technique and performance.
      The methods of technique analysis have been divided into qualitative,
      quantitative and predictive components. Qualitative technique analysis is
      characterized by observation and subjective judgement. Several aids to
      observation are identified, including phase analysis, temporal analysis and
      critical feature analysis. Although biomechanical principles of movement can be
      used to form judgements about technique, little agreement exists about the number
      and categories of these principles. A 'deterministic' model can be used to
      identify factors that affect performance but, in doing so, technique variables
      are frequently overlooked. Quantitative technique analysis relies on
      biomechanical data collection methods. The identification of key technique
      variables that affect performance is a major issue, but these are poorly
      distinguished from other variables that affect performance. Quantitative analysis
      is not suitable for establishing the characteristics of the whole skill, but new 
      methods, such as the use of artificial neural networks, are described that may be
      able to overcome this limitation. Other methods based on modelling and computer
      simulation also have potential for focusing on the whole skill. Predictive
      technique analysis encompasses these developments and offers an attractive
      interface between the scientist and coach through visual animation methods. I
      conclude that biomechanists need to clarify the underpinning rationale, framework
      and scope for the various approaches to technique analysis.

TI  - Modelling coaching practice: the role of instruction and demonstration.
PG  - 793-811
AB  - In this paper, we review the empirical literature pertaining to the effectiveness
      of instructions and movement demonstrations. Initially, we examine existing
      theories and approaches that try to explain the process of skill acquisition so
      as to determine implications of these theories for instructional provision. This 
      is followed by an evaluation of studies in the motor learning literature in which
      pre-practice information has been manipulated. Explicit learning strategies are
      contrasted to implicit and discovery learning methods, and current explanations
      for instructional effects are discussed in terms of such mechanisms as
      effects-related attentional focus and movement variability. In the final
      sections, we review data from our own laboratory where pre-practice information
      has been manipulated during the learning of a novel bimanual coordination task.
      From these studies, proposals are made to try and explain how pre-practice
      information works to effect the process of skill acquisition, including the
      selection and execution of a response and the processing of associated feedback. 
      An important role is given to the existing skills of the learner in understanding
      the instructions and performing the desired movement. Finally, we suggest some
      practical implications of this empirical evidence for the teaching of motor
      skills.

PG  - 755-69
AB  - This paper overviews the diverse information technologies that are used to
      provide athletes with relevant feedback. Examples taken from various sports are
      used to illustrate selected applications of technology-based feedback. Several
      feedback systems are discussed, including vision, audition and proprioception.
      Each technology described here is based on the assumption that feedback would
      eventually enhance skill acquisition and sport performance and, as such, its
      usefulness to athletes and coaches in training is critically evaluated.

TI  - Cardiac risk factors and participation guidelines for youth sports.
PG  - 681-707, v
AB  - Accurate assessment of the cardiac system in pediatric and adolescent youth is
      important. The hemodynamic demands associated with exercise, training, and sport 
      participation are usually positive and beneficial; however, when an underlying
      cardiac problem exists, it is imperative that such cardiac problems be
      identified. Safe sport-related cardiac participation guidelines should be
      provided for young athletes and their families and coaches. This chapter provides
      a physician perspective on the recognition and current cardiac management
      considerations for young athletes participating in both static and dynamic types 
      of sports. The most recent guidelines for hypertension in youth are also
      provided.

TI  - Survey of the injury rate for children in community sports.
PG  - e28
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the baseline injury rate for children ages 7 to 13
      participating in community organized baseball, softball, soccer, and football.
      METHODS: In this observational cohort study, 1659 children were observed during 2
      seasons of sports participation in an urban area. Data were collected by coaches 
      using an injury survey tool designed for the study. A reportable injury was
      defined as one requiring on-field evaluation by coaching staff, or causing a
      player to stop participation for any period of time, or requiring first aid
      during an event. Logistic regression analyses were done within and across sports 
      for injury rates, game versus practice injury frequencies, and gender differences
      where appropriate. RESULTS: The injury rates, calculated per 100 athlete
      exposures during total events (games plus practices), were: baseball, 1.7;
      softball, 1.0; soccer, 2.1; and football, 1.5. The injury rates for baseball and 
      football were not significantly different. Across sports, contusions were the
      most frequent type of injury. Contact with equipment was the most frequent method
      of injury, except in football where contact with another player was the most
      frequent method. In baseball, 3% of all injuries reported were considered serious
      (fracture, dislocation, concussion); in soccer, 1% were considered serious; and
      in football, 14% were considered serious. The frequency of injury per team per
      season (FITS), an estimation of injury risk, was 3 for baseball and soccer, 2 for
      softball, and 14 for football for total events. For all sports, there were more
      game than practice injuries; this difference was significant except for softball.
      There were no significant gender differences in soccer for injury rates during
      total events. CONCLUSIONS: Given the classification of football as a collision
      sport, the high number of exposures per player, the FITS score, and the
      percentage of injuries considered serious, youth football should be a priority
      for injury studies. Health professionals should establish uniform medical
      coverage policies for football even at this age level. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR
      MODIFICATIONS: Injury surveillance for youth sports is gaining momentum as an
      important step toward formulating injury prevention methods. However,
      establishing patterns of injuries, taking preventive measures, and evaluating
      equipment and coaching modifications may take years. In addition to the objective
      findings of this study, our direct observations of community sports through 2
      seasons showed areas where immediate modifications could reduce injury risk. The 
      first recommendation is that youth sports leagues provide and require first aid
      training for coaches. Training could be done by sports medicine professionals and
      include recognition and immediate response to head, neck, and spine injuries, as 
      well as heat-related illnesses. The second recommendation is that youth sports
      leagues have clear, enforceable return to play guidelines for concussions, neck
      and back injuries, fractures, and dislocations. The third recommendation is that 
      baseball and softball leagues consider the injury prevention potential of face
      guards on batting helmets.

TI  - An analysis of teaching and coaching behaviors of elite strength and conditioning
      coaches.
PG  - 456-60
AB  - The purpose of this study was to analyze the coaching behaviors of 6 elite
      strength and conditioning coaches from the southern region of the United States. 
      The Arizona State University Coaching Observation Instrument, consisting of 16
      behavioral categories, was used for the collection of data. Each coach was
      observed and filmed on 3 occasions. All observations occurred in the respective
      team's weight training facility. The data collected in this study consisted of a 
      percentage analysis of the observed coaching behaviors. The most frequently
      observed behaviors were silent monitoring (21.99%), management (14.62%), and
      hustle (11.12%). These results indicate that this population of strength and
      conditioning coaches was predominantly engaged in observation of their athletes
      (silent monitoring), organization of the weight training activity (management),
      and verbal statements to intensify effort (hustle). The results are similar to
      other studies with coaches who were also involved in individual rather than team 
      sports.

TI  - Pediatric neurodevelopment and sports participation. When are children ready to
      play sports?
PG  - 505-31, v-vi
AB  - A fundamental knowledge of normal child and adolescent development is essential
      to providing a developmentally appropriate sports experience for the child, and
      to providing guidance to parents regarding their child's sport participation.
      This article reviews neurodevelopment, normal child and adolescent development
      relevant to sport participation, and developmental readiness to participate in
      sports. Neurodevelopmental maturation is a complex, continuous process. The sense
      of social comparison is not achieved until after 6 years of age, and the ability 
      to understand the competitive nature of sports is generally not achieved until 9 
      years of age. By about 12 years of age, most children are mature enough to
      comprehend the complex tasks of sports and are physically and cognitively ready
      to participate in competitive sports with appropriate supervision.

AB  - As the number of pediatric and adolescent athletes involved in competitive sports
      continues to grow, and as the competitors in youth sports trend toward a "win at 
      all costs" mentality, pediatricians are increasingly being asked to provide
      sports medicine treatment and counseling for athletic children. This article
      outlines the demographic changes in the pediatric and adolescent athlete
      population in the United States and explains how the pediatrician can become a
      more effective caregiver to the athletic patient.

TI  - The name of the game: a review of sexual exploitation of females in sport.
PG  - 225-31
AB  - Sexual harassment and abuse has been a recognized problem in the workplace,
      schools, and residential homes for more than three decades. Many professional
      policies highlight the potential for abusing positions of trust, and therefore
      forbid intimate relationships between, for example, doctors and patients, and
      psychologists and clients. Yet, abuse of power in the coach-athlete relationship 
      has only recently been acknowledged. This paper discusses definitions of sexual
      exploitation, prevalence figures, methods used for entrapping athletes, potential
      risk factors, signs of abuse and harassment, and the consequences for survivors.

TI  - Elite athletes' experiences of the motivational climate: the coach matters.
PG  - 54-9
AB  - Recent research investigating the effect of the motivational climate has found
      that even elite athletes benefit from a mastery climate. The purpose of the
      present study was to obtain a deeper understanding of the importance of the
      climate surrounding an athlete and the role of the coach for elite athletes by
      conducting in-depth interviews with a group of athletes (n=7). The athletes also 
      completed the Perception of Success Questionnaire (POSQ) and Perception of
      Motivational Climate Questionnaire (PMCQ) to measure motivational indices. All
      the athletes were very high on task orientation and moderate to high on ego
      orientation. Most of the athletes perceived a high mastery climate and a low
      performance climate. The athletes emphasized the importance of the coach as the
      creator of the climate, as well as their preference for a supportive and caring
      climate. This speaks for an emphasis on a mastery climate for elite athletes.

TI  - Coaching commitment and turnover: a comparison of current and former coaches.
PG  - 73-86
AB  - Although coaching continuity is thought to be important in developing and
      sustaining quality sport programs, coach turnover is not well understood.
      Consequently, we used a commitment model to address why some coaches maintain
      their involvement while others discontinue coaching. For this study, 469 USA
      Swimming age-group coaches completed a mail survey designed to assess commitment 
      model constructs, including coaching satisfaction, benefits, costs, investments, 
      alternative options, social constraints, and commitment. To test the commitment
      model, we first used structural equation modeling to assess whether the model
      provided an adequate fit to the data for current and former coaches. Overall,
      satisfaction and investments were significantly related to commitment. Moreover, 
      the standardized path coefficients between benefits and costs and satisfaction
      were also significant. Multivariate analysis of variance andfollow-up analyses
      revealed that current coaches reported higher commitment as well as less
      attractive alternative options, higher investments, and higher social constraints
      compared to former coaches. In replication of past research, we compared current 
      andformer coaches on the benefits and costs associated with coaching.

TI  - Does rugby headgear prevent concussion? Attitudes of Canadian players and
      coaches.
PG  - 19-22
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the attitudes of players and coaches to the use of
      protective headgear, particularly with respect to the prevention of concussion.
      METHODS: A questionnaire designed to assess attitudes to headgear was
      administered to 63 players from four different Canadian teams, each representing 
      a different level of play (high school, university, community club, national). In
      addition, coaches from all four levels were questioned about team policies and
      their personal opinions about the use of headgear to prevent concussion. RESULTS:
      Although the players tended to believe that the headgear could prevent concussion
      (62%), the coaches were less convinced (33%). Despite the players' belief that
      headgear offers protection against concussion, only a minority reported wearing
      headgear (27%) and few (24%) felt that its use should be made mandatory. Common
      reasons for not wearing headgear were "its use is not mandatory", "it is
      uncomfortable", and "it costs too much". CONCLUSION: Although most players in the
      study believe that rugby headgear may prevent concussion, only a minority
      reported wearing it. Coaches tended to be less convinced than the players that
      rugby headgear can prevent concussion.

TI  - [Medicine in sports or sport medicine?] ].
PG  - 261-4
AB  - Sports medicine is a profession pertaining to primary health care of sport
      population (competitors, coaches, referees, participants in sports recreation).
      It embraces the physical and mental health protection and promotion of
      participants in relation to a particular sport activity and sport environment,
      directing athletes to a sport and adapting them to sport and the sport to them.
      Sports medicine takes part in selection procedure, training process planning and 
      programming, and cares for epidemiological, hygienic, nutritional and other
      problems in sport. The Republic of Croatia belongs to those world states in which
      the field of sports medicine is regulated neither by a law or by profession. A
      consequence is that wide circle of physicians and paramedics work in clubs and
      various medical units without any legal or/and professional control not being
      adequately educated nor having licence for it. This review is an appeal to the
      Croatian Medical Chamber and the Ministry of Health to make efforts to promote
      the education and medical profession in sports medicine.

TI  - The prevention of shin splints in sports: a systematic review of literature.
PG  - 32-40
AB  - PURPOSE: To review the published and unpublished evidence regarding risk factors 
      associated with shin splints, assess the effectiveness of prevention strategies, 
      and offer evidence-based recommendations to coaches, athletes, and researchers.
      METHODS: We searched electronic data bases without language restriction,
      identified citations from reference sections of research papers retrieved,
      contacted experts in the field, and searched the Cochrane Collaboration. Of the
      199 citations identified, we emphasized results of the four reports that compared
      methods to prevent shin splints. We assessed the methodologic quality of these
      reports by using a standardized instrument. RESULTS: The use of shock-absorbent
      insoles, foam heel pads, heel cord stretching, alternative footwear, as well as
      graduated running programs among military recruits have undergone assessment in
      controlled trials. There is no strong support for any of these interventions, and
      each of the four controlled trials is limited methodologically. Median quality
      scores in these four studies ranged from 29 to 47, and serious flaws in study
      design, control of bias, and statistical methods were identified. CONCLUSION: Our
      review yielded little objective evidence to support widespread use of any
      existing interventions to prevent shin splints. The most encouraging evidence for
      effective prevention of shin splints involves the use of shock-absorbing insoles.
      However, serious flaws in study design and implementation constrain the work in
      this field thus far. A rigorously implemented research program is critically
      needed to address this common sports medicine problem.

TI  - An operational model to investigate contact sports injuries.
PG  - 1999-2003
AB  - PURPOSE: A cyclical operational model is proposed to examine the
      interrelationship of a number of factors that are involved in sports injury
      epidemiology. In sports injury research, investigations often attempt to identify
      a unique risk factor that distinguishes an injured player. However, a wide
      variety of factors can contribute to a sports injury occurring, and an
      understanding of the cause of injury is important to advance knowledge. METHODS: 
      The proposed model identifies a healthy/fit player initially, although the player
      may exhibit a number of intrinsic risk factors for sports injury. Before exposure
      to extrinsic risk factors, there is the opportunity for implementation of
      prevention strategies by coaching personnel and the sports medicine team. These
      strategies might include, among others, appropriate warm-up, adequate hydration, 
      wearing protective equipment, and prophylactic taping. Additionally, preventative
      screening could take place to assess the various intrinsic and extrinsic risk
      factors that could lead to sports injury. DISCUSSION: Two examples of how the
      operational model relates to contact sports injury cases are presented.
      Participating in sport inevitably exposes the player to external risk factors
      that predispose toward injury. The treatment of the injured player aims to
      restore the player to preinjury playing status and to prevent the injury from
      becoming chronic. CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that the application of this
      proposed cyclical model may lead to greater success in understanding the
      multifaceted nature of sports injuries and furthermore help minimize injury risk 
      and support the rehabilitation of injured contact sports participants.

TI  - Potential applications of heat and cold stress indices to sporting events.
PG  - 909-17
AB  - Many recreational and elite athletes participate in sporting events every year.
      However, when these events are conducted under hostile environmental conditions, 
      whether in cold or hot climates, the risk for environmental illnesses increases. 
      The higher the stress, the greater is the potential for performance decrements,
      injuries and illnesses. The most common expected heat illnesses are heat
      exhaustion and heatstroke, whereas hypothermia and frostbite are the most common 
      cold injuries. However, heat and cold stress indices can minimise the risk for
      environmental illnesses and dehydration by following the recommendations and
      guidelines which accompany these indices. Stress indices should be used by
      athletes, coaches and officials to prevent injury and improve safety conditions
      for competitors and participants in recreational activities. All participants
      should be made aware of warning signs, susceptibility and predisposing
      conditions. Coaches should be aware of their responsibility with regard to the
      safety of their trainees, and officials should organise and plan events at times 
      that are likely to be of low environmental stress. However, they must also be
      prepared and equipped with the means necessary to reduce injuries and treat cases
      of collapse and environmental illnesses. The lack of a friendly, small and simple
      device for environmental stress assessment is probably the main reason why stress
      indices are not commonly used. We believe that developing a new portable heat and
      cold stress monitor in wristwatch format for use by those exposed to
      environmental stress could help in the decision making process of expected
      hazards caused by exercising and working in hostile environments, and might help 
      prevent heat and cold illnesses.

TI  - Psychological factors in sport performance: the Mental Health Model revisited.
PG  - 875-90
AB  - The Mental Health Model (MHM) of sport performance purports that an inverse
      relationship exists between psychopathology and sport performance. The model
      postulates that as an athlete's mental health either worsens or improves
      performance should fall or rise accordingly, and there is now considerable
      support for this view. Studies have shown that between 70 and 85% of successful
      and unsuccessful athletes can be identified using general psychological measures 
      of personality structure and mood state, a level superior to chance but
      insufficient for the purpose of selecting athletes. Longitudinal MHM research
      indicates that the mood state responses of athletes exhibit a dose-response
      relationship with their training load, a finding that has shown potential for
      reducing the incidence of the staleness syndrome in athletes who undergo
      intensive physical training. The MHM also has implications for the general care
      of athletes as support services have traditionally been limited to preventing or 
      treating physical problems. Despite its simple premise and empirical support, the
      MHM has often been mischaracterised in the sport psychology literature and
      recently some authors have questioned its validity. This overview will summarise 
      MHM research, including the more recent work involving the model's dynamic
      features in an effort to resolve disputes surrounding the model.

TI  - Concussion in sports: minimizing the risk for complications.
PG  - 1007-14
AB  - Mild traumatic brain injury, or concussion, is a common consequence of
      collisions, falls and other forms of contact in sports. Concussion may be defined
      as an acute trauma-induced alteration of mental function lasting fewer than 24
      hours, with or without preceding loss of consciousness. The physician's
      responsibilities in assessing an athlete with concussion include determining the 
      need for emergency intervention and offering guidance about the athlete's ability
      to return to play. Concussion may be complicated by cerebral edema related to the
      second impact syndrome, cumulative neuropsychologic deficits, intracranial
      bleeding or the postconcussion syndrome. The risk of complications is increased
      in athletes who prematurely return to play and in those with prolonged loss of
      consciousness or post-traumatic amnesia. An athlete with prolonged loss of
      consciousness or signs and symptoms that worsen or persist after a concussion
      should be evaluated in the emergency department. An athlete should not be allowed
      to resume sports participation until all symptoms of a concussion have resolved.

TI  - Comparing sports injuries in men and women.
PG  - 420-3
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the pattern of injury between men and women in seven
      collegiate sports to determine if gender-specific factors exist which could be
      modified to reduce the risk of injury to female athletes. DESIGN: Retrospective
      cohort study of injury reports compiled by certified athletic trainers between
      Fall 1980 and Spring 1995. SETTING: An NCAA division III College. PARTICIPANTS:
      Eighteen to 22 year-old male and female college athletes competing in seven like 
      sports (basketball, cross-country running, soccer, swimming, tennis, track and
      water polo) at the intercollegiate level, playing similar number of contests and 
      using the same facilities. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Analyses of injury patterns,
      classified by sport and anatomic location, for men and women in seven like
      sports. RESULTS: A total of 3,767 participants were included in the study, with
      1874 sports-related injuries reported among the men and women's teams. Of these
      injuries, 856 (45.7%) were sustained by female and 1018 (54.3%) by male athletes.
      Overall, no statistically significant gender difference was found for injuries
      per 100 participant-years (52.5 for female athlete versus 47.7 for males). A
      statistically significant gender difference in injury incidence (p < 0.001) was
      seen for two sports: swimming and water polo. Female swimmers reported more
      back/neck, shoulder, hip, knee and foot injuries: and female water polo players
      reported more shoulder injuries. When evaluating all sports concurrently, female 
      athletes reported a higher rate of hip, lower-leg and shoulder injuries, while
      male athletes reported a higher rate of thigh injuries. CONCLUSION: Except for
      some minor gender differences in total injuries for two sports and several
      differences in total injuries by anatomic location, our data suggest very little 
      difference in the pattern of injury between men and women competing in comparable
      sports. The increased rate of shoulder injury among female swimmers probably
      resulted from the more rigorous training philosophy of their coach. Thus, no
      gender-specific recommendations can be suggested for decreasing the incidence of 
      injury to female athletes competing in these sports.

TI  - Standardized mental status assessment of sports concussion.
PG  - 176-81
AB  - Neurocognitive status is often considered the domain of neurologic functioning
      most sensitive to change following concussion, but the effects are often subtle
      and difficult to detect on routine clinical examination. Recent efforts have
      focused on the development of brief, standardized methods of mental status
      assessment for use by sports medicine clinicians to quantify the acute
      neurocognitive effects of concussion and objectively track postinjury recovery.
      Research has demonstrated the reliability, validity, and sensitivity of these
      measures in detecting concussion in athletes and providing empirical data for
      consideration in the context of other examination findings, neuropsychologic test
      data, and neuroimaging results. Standardized measures of mental status and other 
      postconcussive symptoms are valuable tools to assist clinicians in the assessment
      and management of concussion, but should not be used as a replacement for medical
      evaluation or viewed as a stand-alone means for determining readiness to return
      to competition after injury.

TI  - The assessment of sport-related concussion: the evidence behind
      neuropsychological testing and management.
PG  - 134-43
AB  - Because of the lack of valid evidence to support the current recommendations for 
      the management of mild traumatic brain injury (concussion), many physicians,
      athletic trainers, coaches, and athletes have called into question the way
      concussions are treated in athletics. This review article discusses the current
      evidence for the management of concussion in high school, college, and
      professional sports. A complete review of the epidemiologic and
      neuropsychological studies to date is presented and critically reviewed, as are
      other assessment and management tools in concussion. The appropriate use of
      neuropsychological testing, grading scales, and return-to-play recommendations
      are discussed in depth based on the current evidence. Additionally, areas
      requiring further research are identified and future trends are briefly
      discussed.

PG  - 933-6
AB  - This study investigated the personal experiences of 144 high school coaches in
      terms of their perceptions of the causes of the home advantage. Surveys were
      distributed to varsity coaches of local high school sports asking them to assign 
      a percentage value to each of the most common explanations of -the home
      advantage, reflecting the perceived importance of each, e.g., social support,
      travel or fatigue, site familiarity, officials' bias, and self-fulfilling
      prophecy. A 3 x 6 repeated-measures analysis of variance indicated that no
      differences were significant in attribution of the causes of home advantage for
      the combinations of sex of coach and sex of athlete. A significant difference was
      noted in the percentages assigned across the five explanations provided the
      coaches. Post hoc comparison indicated that site familiarity was seen as the most
      important explanation across the combinations of the sex of coach and sex of
      athlete.

TI  - Use of oral creatine as an ergogenic aid for increased sports performance:
      perceptions of adolescent athletes.
PG  - 608-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: Competitive athletes, including adolescents, seek ways to gain
      advantage over competitors. One ergogenic aid is creatine, a naturally occurring 
      nitrogen compound found primarily in skeletal muscle. Increasing creatine levels 
      may prolong skeletal muscle activity, enhancing work output. METHODS: A
      questionnaire assessing awareness and use of creatine supplementation was
      completed by 674 athletes from 11 high schools. Data were statistically analyzed 
      to determine variation among groups. RESULTS: Of those surveyed, 75% had
      knowledge of creatine supplements, and 16% used creatine to enhance athletic
      performance. Percentage of use increased with age and grade level. Awareness and 
      use were greater among boys than girls. Adverse effects were reported by 26%.
      Most athletes consumed creatine using a method inconsistent with scientific
      recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Use of creatine by adolescent athletes is
      significant and inconsistent with optimal dosing. Physicians, athletic trainers, 
      and coaches should disseminate proper information and advise these adolescent
      athletes.

      We now find ourselves in the insidious position of being unable to predict
      convincingly either safety or major health risks with performance-enhancing drug 
      use. The use of performance-enhancing drugs is no longer limited to the elite
      athlete. In 1993 the Canadian Center for Drug-free Sport estimated that 83 000
      children between the ages of 11 and 18 had used anabolic steroids in the previous
      12 months. Recent evidence suggests anabolic steroids are now the third most
      commonly offered drugs to children in the UK, behind cannabis and amphetamines.
      The role of the physician of today is to regain our position of impartiality and 
      objectivity within both the sporting and general community. Only then will we be 
      able to pursue a harm minimisation strategy designed to convince the public that 
      it is better to be the best you can be naturally. For the majority, the
      improvement through the use of performance-enhancing drugs can equally be
      achieved through dietary and training advice. For the elite athlete, what price a
      gold medal that is tarnished by deceit? Its value then can only lie with the
      sponsors and politicians, for they can no longer claim to be sportsmen, only
      entertainers.

TI  - Gender influences on career opportunities, practice choices, and job satisfaction
      in a cohort of physicians with certification in sports medicine.
PG  - 96-102
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the gender differences in practice patterns, experiences,
      and career opportunities for family physicians who practice sports medicine.
      DESIGN: Descriptive, self-administered questionnaire. PARTICIPANTS: Family
      physicians with Certificate of Added Qualification (CAQ) in sports medicine were 
      surveyed. The survey was sent to all women with a CAQ in Sports Medicine and a
      random sample of 20% of the men with CAQs in sports medicine. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURE: Survey consisted of multiple choice, Likert scale, and opened-ended
      questions. The data was analyzed with contingency tables, with gender as the
      dependent variable. RESULTS: Response rate to the survey was 75%, which included 
      42 females and 102 males. Demographics of our population demonstrated some gender
      differences. Males were of higher average age (41.1 vs. 38.1), and more likely to
      be married and have children. Practice types, location, and time spent in sports 
      medicine did not differ with the exception of training room and event coverage.
      Males were more likely to cover all levels of training room except at the
      Division I level, where the percent of males and females covering training rooms 
      were equal. Males were also more likely to cover all types of sporting events.
      Job satisfaction and reasons for choosing current jobs did not show significant
      gender differences. However, factors affecting career opportunities did vary.
      Professional relationships with athletic trainers and coaches were perceived to
      be different by males and females surveyed. CONCLUSIONS: Our survey of sports
      medicine physicians showed some gender differences in practice patterns relative 
      to training room and sporting event coverage. Surprisingly, there were not many
      differences in the factors that affected job choice and factors affecting job
      opportunities with the exception of gender itself. However, our study does not
      conclude how or when gender begins to affect the female sports medicine
      physician's career opportunities.

TI  - Nutrition knowledge, opinions, and practices of coaches and athletic trainers at 
      a division 1 university.
PG  - 174-85
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to assess nutrition knowledge, opinions,
      and practices of coaches and trainers at a Division I university. Participants (n
      = 53) completed questionnaires regarding nutrition knowledge, opinions, and
      practices. Descriptive statistics and analysis of variance were used to analyze
      data. Overall, participants responded correctly to 67% of nutrition knowledge
      questions. Participants who coached/trained female athletes tended to score
      better than respondents who coached/trained male athletes. Strength and
      conditioning coaches and participants with greater than 15 years of experience
      scored higher than other participants. Nutrition opinions/practices responses
      revealed that nutritional supplements were provided for all but 6% of
      participants' athletes. Participants rated body weight as more important than
      body composition to athletes' performances. Over 30% of participants perceived at
      least one case of disordered eating within the past year. Some participants (53%)
      felt that athletes may consume more nutritious meals on team-sponsored trips if
      given larger food allowances. Thirty percent of participants reported dietitians 
      were available to them; the same percentage reported utilizing dietitians.
      Coaches and trainers are knowledgeable about some appropriate nutritional
      recommendations, but registered dietitians or qualified sports nutrition
      professionals may complement the nutrition-related education and counseling of
      athletes (23).

TI  - A test of processing efficiency theory in a team sport context.
PG  - 321-32
AB  - In this study, we tested some key postulates of Eysenck and Calvo's processing
      efficiency theory in a team sport. The participants were 12 elite male volleyball
      players who were followed throughout the course of a competitive season.
      Self-report measures of pre-match and in-game cognitive anxiety and mental effort
      were collected in groups of players high and low in dispositional anxiety. Player
      performance was determined from the statistical analysis of match-play. Sets were
      classified according to the point spread separating the two teams into one of
      three levels of criticality. Game momentum was also analysed to determine its
      influence on in-game state anxiety. Significant differences in in-game cognitive 
      anxiety were apparent between high and low trait anxiety groups. An interaction
      between anxiety grouping and momentum condition was also evident in cognitive
      anxiety. Differences in set criticality were reflected in significant elevations 
      in mental effort, an effect more pronounced in dispositionally high anxious
      performers. Consistent with the predictions of processing efficiency theory,
      mental effort ratings were higher in high trait-anxious players in settings where
      their performance was equivalent to that of low trait-anxious performers. The
      usefulness of processing efficiency theory as an explanatory framework in sport
      anxiety research is discussed in the light of these findings.

TI  - [Play sports and feel well! Effects of sports on mental health].
PG  - 202-5
AB  - The role of mental health is increasingly recognised in the discussion about
      health. In this article, health is considered to be a dynamic balance between
      resources and potential risk factors. Sport and physical activity may represent
      resources that do not only contribute to an increased well-being, but also to an 
      improved self concept as a cognitive representation of one's health-status.
      Investigations of the short-time effects of sport show that different activities 
      result in different mood changes, but also that the initial mood is important in 
      such a way that people with a bad mood profit more from physical activity
      programmes. More permanent physical activity results in better well-being, but
      also in an improved perception of the health status and a higher satisfaction
      with health. Individually tailored new physical activity behaviour programmes and
      reinforcing systems have to be developed. These may lead to adequately strengthen
      the self-efficacy and increase the well-being of a broader population.

TI  - Derogation of student female athletes who consult a sport psychologist: an
      alternative perspective on the negative halo effect.
PG  - 39-47
AB  - This study attempts to further research female student athletes' perceptions of
      the sport psychologist and other sport and mental health professionals. 90
      British student athletes from 17 different sports completed a two-part
      questionnaire to examine the potential derogation effect as a result of
      consulting one of three identified professionals and to explore the perceived
      definition and role of the sport psychologist. A fictitious selection report of a
      female field hockey player was presented to subjects with coach, sport
      psychologist and psychotherapist as the three professionals. It was hypothesised 
      that subjects' recommendations regarding selection would differ depending on the 
      consultant used. No differences were found which suggests the absence of a
      negative halo effect and that derogation would not occur within this sample
      group. Definitions and perceived role of the sport psychologist varied with the
      subjective tone of the responses from participants being mainly positive (74%).
      These results indicate that this female student athlete sample has a moderated,
      even a positive, perception of the sport psychologist. A general acceptance of
      the sport psychologist falls in line with the suggestions of Murstein and
      Fontaine (1993) concerning a reported increase in acceptance of mental health
      professionals.

TI  - Attribution of athletic expertise by college coaches.
PG  - 193-207
AB  - The goals of the study were to identify the factors that college coaches
      associate with athletic achievement and to test deliberate practice theory
      predictions for practice relevance, effort, and pleasure. Swimming, tennis, and
      volleyball coaches from Division I and Division III schools rank ordered 15
      attributes that contribute to successful athletic achievement. They also rated
      the relevance, effort, and pleasure of 7 athletic and 7 everyday events for
      improving athletic achievement. The rank orders showed that the coaches primarily
      attributed athletic achievement to innate talent, intrinsic motivation, and
      effort while factors such as accumulated practice and type of the practice
      received lower rankings. Findings for practice effort were consistent with
      deliberate practice theory while the relevance and pleasure findings were mixed. 
      Several explanations for successful athletic achievement, other than talent, are 
      discussed.

TI  - Attitudes of coaches towards doping.
PG  - 132-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coaches are usually held to be among the main actors of doping
      prevention campaigns. The aim of this study was to document certain attitudes of 
      professional coaches faced with doping, and to evaluate how they confronted it on
      an everyday basis. METHODS: EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: prospective study by
      self-reporting questionnaire. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: the questionnaire was
      mailed to the last 800 graduated coaches (1994-1997) in the Lorraine region,
      Eastern France. The 260 responding coaches comprised 77 women and 183 men, the
      average age being 30.8 +/- 8.0 years (mean +/- standard deviation). RESULTS:
      10.3% of coaches consider that an athlete may use doping with no health hazard
      with the help of a physician, and 30.0% that an athlete who declines doping has
      little chance of succeeding. 5.8% had used doping drugs in the last twelve months
      (1 to 6 times). 13.5% of coaches mention that athletes (1 to 5 per coach on
      average) told them they had been prompted to use doping drugs during the previous
      12 months. 80.7% consider that the current methods of preventing doping in sport 
      are ineffective, and 98.1% of them consider that they have a role to play within 
      this context, but 80.3% consider themselves badly trained in the prevention of
      doping. Only 10.4% have organized a doping prevention action during the last 12
      months. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, professional coaches do not seem to be
      efficient in the prevention of doping. Further education and training for coaches
      on doping is advisable.

TI  - Effects of alternated sport competition in perceived competence for adolescent
      males with mild to moderate mental retardation.
PG  - 51-8
AB  - Since the beginning of the 1990s, two types of organized competitive sport
      (Segregated or Integrated) have been proposed for adolescents with mental
      retardation (AMR). These programmes often have as an objective the improvement of
      the individual's perceived competence. In France, a third competitive system,
      called Alternated sport meets (Segregated and Integrated) is actually used. The
      purpose of this study is to examine the effects of this type of programme and
      type of sport (basketball versus running) on domains of perceived competence and 
      general self-worth. The participants were 32 AMR (Mean age 13.5 years, SD = 0.80)
      divided equally into four groups: (a) alternated basketball; (b) alternated
      running; (c) control, adapted physical activity; (d) control, sedentary. The
      experimental treatment was for 7 months. The sport groups participated in 2 hours
      training each week and six competitive meets. We administrated Harter's (1985)
      Self-Perception Profile for Children seven times to determine changes in
      perceived competence and general self-worth. Results indicated no significant

TI  - Gambling as an addictive disorder among athletes: clinical issues in sports
      medicine.
PG  - 145-52
AB  - This article examines the role of gambling as an addictive disorder experienced
      by athletes, both college and professional. Gambling may often be seen as a
      comorbid factor with other addictions and with depression among athletes. The
      focus on addictions among athletes has gained considerable attention among sports
      medicine clinicians. Diagnostic indicators, risk and protective factors, and a
      stage model of addiction among athletes are addressed. An algorithm and pathway
      of care for athletes with an addictive disorder is offered as are recommendations
      that sports physicians, sports medicine specialists, coaches and counsellors need
      to address athletes who have an addictive disorder.

TI  - Travel medicine advice to UK based international motor sport teams.
PG  - 267-74
AB  - BACKGROUND: International motor sport teams travel extensively. Over the years,
      the design and build of racing cars has improved so that morbidity and mortality 
      in motor sport has been lessened. Those team members supporting the competitors
      need to be physically and mentally fit to perform complicated tasks, despite
      having traveled. This group of travelers has not been studied to any extent
      previously. METHOD: An anonymous questionnaire asking some basic travel medicine 
      related questions was distributed to the support team members of a Rally team,
      and Formula One Grand Prix team. Both teams were based in the UK, and competed in
      all the rounds of their respective world championships. RESULTS: Ten Rally team
      members and 18 Formula One team members responded to the questionnaire. The
      results showed moderate coverage of commonly used vaccinations; appropriate use
      of antimalarials and insect repellents, but by no means by all team members;
      little or no problems with traveler's diarrhea; some tendencies to problems
      related to jet lag, but no real attempt to prevent the problem; and finally some 
      attempt at skin protection against solar damage. CONCLUSION: Support teams are
      reasonably well prepared for the combination of, the rigors of frequent travel,
      and a demanding job. There is a deficit in vaccine coverage, especially of both
      hepatitis A and B, some education is needed in preventing skin problems later in 
      life due to sun exposure, and further study of jet lag and its implications might
      be appropriate.

TI  - [Can sports and physical activity promote young peoples' psychosocial health?].
PG  - 3573-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sport and physical activity is generally believed to be beneficial to
      young people's psychosocial health, but the scientific evidence seems equivocal. 
      This article gives a narrative review of recent developments in the literature on
      psychosocial health effects of physical activity and sport among children and
      adolescents. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Based on a narrative review of a selection of 
      metaanalytical and key studies, results in four areas of psychosocial functioning
      are presented. RESULTS: Findings support an association between involvement in
      physical activity and sport and well-being. Physical activity is associated with 
      lower levels of mental health problems, and seems to promote self-esteem.
      Physical activity as a treatment of mental health problems for this age group is 
      underexplored and no firm conclusions can be made. The evidence with respect to
      effects on cognitive and academic functioning is weak. Further, the evidence that
      juvenile delinquency and antisocial development could be counteracted is
      equivocal. INTERPRETATION: There is a paucity of studies that can confirm any
      causal effects. Future research would benefit particularly from studying the role
      of sports and physical activity mode as well as the psychological and social
      context in which it may produce beneficial psychosocial outcomes.

TI  - Second to fourth digit ratio and male ability in sport: implications for sexual
      selection in humans.
PG  - 61-69
AB  - Fetal and adult testosterone may be important in establishing and maintaining
      sex-dependent abilities associated with male physical competitiveness. There is
      evidence that the ratio of the length of the 2nd and 4th digits (2D:4D) is a
      negative correlate of prenatal and adult testosterone. We use ability in sports, 
      and particularly ability in football, as a proxy for male physical
      competitiveness. Compared to males with high 2D:4D ratio, men with low ratio
      reported higher attainment in a range of sports and had higher mental rotation
      scores (a measure of visual-spatial ability). Professional football players had
      lower 2D:4D ratios than controls. Football players in 1st team squads had lower
      2D:4D than reserves or youth team players. Men who had represented their country 
      had lower ratios than those who had not, and there was a significant (one-tailed)
      negative association between 2D:4D and number of international appearances after 
      the effect of country was removed. We suggest that prenatal and adult
      testosterone promotes the development and maintenance of traits which are useful 
      in sports and athletics disciplines and in male:male fighting.

TI  - A study of the knowledge that school rugby coaches have in the management and
      prevention of serious neck injury.
PG  - 171-4
AB  - The following study is an analysis of the knowledge school rugby coaches
      responsible for Senior Cup Team in Leinster, have in the area of neck injury
      prevention and management. When serious neck injuries affect schoolboys it is
      particularly tragic and deserves special attention. The study targeted all the
      coaches of Senior Cup Teams in Leinster. Results showed that coaches lack vital
      knowledge in the area of neck injury prevention, recognition and management. Only
      50% (n = 18) of coaches have a first aid qualification and only 47% (n = 17)
      carry first aid equipment to deal with neck injuries to matches. More than half
      of the schools in the study sample do not have neck collars available and a
      staggering 83% (n = 30) of schools do not have a stretcher available to SCT
      players. The study highlights the need to provide better first aid facilities in 
      schools and demonstrates the need for further education of school rugby coaches.

TI  - The relationship between coaching behaviours and sport anxiety in athletes.
PG  - 110-9
AB  - Previous research has identified the relationship between athlete sport anxiety
      and various sport outcomes (e.g., performance and dropout). For the majority of
      athletes involved in sport, the coach is an influential element of the
      competitive experience. Two hundred and twenty-eight athletes from 15 sports,
      completed the Sport Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Coaching Behavior Scale for Sport
      (CBS-S). The predictive ability of athletes' perceived frequency of seven
      coaching behaviours (physical training, mental preparation, goal setting,
      technical skills, competition strategies, personal rapport and negative personal 
      rapport) on four forms of sport anxiety (total anxiety, somatic anxiety,
      concentration disruption and worry) was examined. Results indicate that negative 
      personal rapport was a significant predictor of all measured forms of sport
      anxiety while competition strategies was a significant predictor for total
      anxiety, concentration disruption, and worry. Other behaviours were not
      significant. The findings suggest that negative rapport between coach and athlete
      is an important contributor to athlete anxiety. In addition, behaviours that the 
      coach demonstrates relative to competition can be influential in reducing athlete
      anxiety.

      training and competition].
PG  - 4848-53
AB  - Head injuries in sports have received increased attention during the past decade.
      As explained in this article, the most recent guidelines for the management of
      head injuries in sports adopted by the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) have
      been adapted for the Swedish sports society. The guidelines include a grading
      scale of head injuries in sports, a sideline evaluation to aid physicians,
      coaches and athletes in the acute situation, and a management strategy for safe
      return to play after a head injury. The use of these guidelines will facilitate
      appropriate acute and subacute management and thereby prevent repeated head
      injuries that could lead to potentially catastrophic outcome or long-term
      cognitive sequelae.

TI  - Psychological and sport-specific characteristics of football players.
PG  - S22-8
AB  - It is hypothesized that players of different levels of play might differ not only
      in their football skills but also in their way of playing football and with
      respect to psychological factors such as concentration, reaction time, or
      competitive anxiety. The psychological characteristics of a player might
      influence his way of playing football (in particular with respect to fair play)
      and also his risk of injury. A group of 588 football players were studied by
      questionnaire; additionally, reaction time tests were performed. Psychological
      characteristics were assessed by three established self-evaluation
      questionnaires: the Athletic Coping Skills Inventory, the State Competitive
      Anxiety Test, and the State-Trait-Anger-Expression-Inventory. Football-specific
      characteristics that were investigated included playing experience and positions 
      played, style of play, number of training hours and games, as well as aspects of 
      fair play. Reaction time was tested twice: without the influence of physical
      exercise and immediately after a 12-minute run. A significant reduction in
      reaction time was observed after physical exercise. In high-level players, the
      reaction time immediately after the 12-minute run was significantly shorter than 
      it was in low-level players. The questionnaire answers given regarding fair play 
      clearly indicated that fair play is not paid sufficient respect. The relationship
      between psychological characteristics and attitudes toward fair play was analyzed
      and discussed.

TI  - Lower limb injuries in children in sports.
PG  - 637-62
AB  - This article presents an overview of sports-related injuries of the lower limb in
      children, with emphasis on the management. The special injury-related conditions 
      of childhood, epidemiology, and the particular pattern of injuries are discussed.
      The increased participation of children in sports will continue. Permanent damage
      is a risk, and, as such, prevention should be the most important management in
      this age group. For example, stretching exercises should be performed with "warm"
      muscles. Excessive weight training has an unacceptable risk of injury. In
      endurance sports, the "10 percent rule," which consists of increasing activity by
      10% each week, probably could be applied to prevent overuse injuries. A
      multifactorial approach may be helpful. The rationale for high performance,
      competitive sports for children is doubtful. The optimal levels of safe training 
      will remain changeable and not predictable. It should be the responsibility of
      parents, coaches, and healthcare professionals to try and minimize the potential 
      for injury and disability, and allow children to enjoy the benefits of sports.

TI  - Provision of enabling technology in professional sports.
PG  - 1219-30
AB  - Multiple-round golf tournaments are designed intentionally to separate
      individuals' scores as play proceeds. Variance analyses and consideration of
      individual differences (vs group mean effects) for a sample of professional
      events confirm that 3-, 4-, and 5-round tournaments show significantly increased 
      variability (though stable means) from first to last rounds. It is argued here
      that the dispersion of scores increases as play proceeds because the more
      physically or mentally fit players emerge and continue to perform best.
      Furthermore, a marginal income analysis indicates that the average gain in
      earnings from a one-shot improvement in score is approximately $8,000. An
      interpretation based on fatigue, competition, and stress supports the
      Professional Golf Association's claim that provision of enabling devices, like a 
      golf cart for disabled players, is also an enhancement and is thus unfair.

TI  - Injury toll following the 1997 Maccabiah Games bridge collapse: implications of
      major disasters for sports medicine teams.
PG  - 63-71
AB  - A major disaster was encountered at the 1997 Maccabiah Games in Israel. As the
      Australian team was about to enter the main stadium for the opening ceremony, a
      pedestrian bridge they were crossing collapsed, killing 4 athletes and injuring
      many others. The aim of this paper is to establish the rates, types and
      anatomical locations of musculoskeletal injuries incurred by members of the
      Australian Maccabiah Games team, with particular reference to the impact of the
      bridge collapse. In total, the 410 members of the team (360 athletes and coaches 
      and 50 team officials) reported 166 injuries from their participation in sport
      and 30 musculoskeletal injuries associated with the collapse of the bridge. The
      most common sports-related injuries were sprains and strains to the hip/thigh,
      lumbar spine and ankle/foot regions, while the bridge collapse resulted in, most 
      commonly, sprains and contusions to the hip/thigh, knee, lower leg and ankle/foot
      regions. In addition, team members incurred many medical and psychological
      conditions. This paper makes several recommendations for sports medicine staff
      based on the experience of this significant sport disaster.

TI  - The significance of water in sport and weight control.
PG  - 127-32
AB  - Intake of food and drink during exercise can be effective in enhancing
      performance, in so far as it prevents or ameliorates exercise-induced changes to 
      body homeostasis. Loss of body fluids containing water and electrolytes during
      exercise is mostly by sweating. Sweat rates during a sporting event or activity
      will vary according to a number of factors, including the size of the athlete and
      his or her degree of acclimatization, the intensity of exercise, environmental
      conditions and the clothing worn. The mismatch of fluid intake and fluid losses
      may lead to a body water deficit. It has generally been considered that decreases
      in performance become apparent when hypohydration exceeds 2% of body weight; that
      performance decrements become substantial when fluid losses exceed 5% of body
      weight; and that when fluid losses approach 6-10% of body weight, heat stroke and
      heat exhaustion become life-threatening. Hypohydration also affects mental
      functioning. Therefore, the effect of hypohydration on real-life sport may be
      greater than that shown in laboratory studies of physiological performance.

TI  - Sports related mild traumatic brain injury in adolescents.
PG  - 317-21
AB  - While head injuries are not common in youth sports, they may have catastrophic
      results. Concussion is also referred to as mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI).
      Although the occurrence of head injuries has been studied more extensively in
      American football, the findings have wider application for any MTBI. Recently,
      more attention has been directed at other sports in which both boys and girls
      participate. The diagnosis of MTBI is based on subjective findings and subtle
      changes in mental status. Other cerebral injuries requiring emergent or urgent
      neurosurgical attention should be ruled out. Objective tests such as CT scans and
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are usually without significant findings in
      MTBI. Neuropsychological testing may demonstrate areas of deficiencies, however, 
      results may be difficult to interpret because of confounding factors.
      Complications following MTBI have been known to occur. The most catastrophic of
      these is second impact syndrome. There are a variety of guidelines for return to 
      play following a concussion, which have been designed in an effort to avoid
      problems such as second impact syndrome. These guidelines are based more on
      clinical experience than on scientific evidence. Education, good training and
      coaching techniques, improved equipment, and rule changes and enforcement, can
      all help in curbing the sports related head injuries in adolescents.

TI  - The safety practices of sporting clubs/centres in the city of Hume.
PG  - 9-16
AB  - Sports injuries are a significant public health problem in Australia. However,
      little information is available about community level sports injuries, or about
      the sports safety policies and practices of community level sports organisations 
      in Australia. The aim of this paper is to present the results of a survey of
      local clubs and sporting centres in the City of Hume, a local council in
      Victoria. This is the first reported survey of safety practices of sporting
      clubs/centres at the community level in Australia. Sixty-four clubs/centres
      participated in the survey, which involved face-to-face interviews with
      representatives from the participating clubs/centres. A major finding was that
      whilst sports bodies perform certain activities typically associated with
      preventing sports injuries, they often do not have formal policies or written
      objectives which recognise the safety of their participants as an important goal.
      The sports safety measures reported to be adopted by the surveyed clubs/centres
      included use of protective equipment, accredited coaches, sports trainers,
      encouraging warm-ups, modified rules for juniors and checking of playing areas
      and facilities for environmental hazards. The provision of first aid services
      (including personnel and equipment) varied across the sporting clubs/centres. The
      major barriers towards improving sports safety were reported to be a lack of
      funds, the media's attitude towards sports injuries and the role of the local
      council as the owner of sporting facilities. There is also a clear role for
      researchers to improve the dissemination of key findings from their injury
      prevention research in a form that can be readily used at the grass roots of
      sports participation.

TI  - Coaches' expectations and beliefs regarding benefits of youth sport
      participation.
PG  - 399-402
AB  - Although many have investigated why children participate in sport, little is
      known about what adults expect children to gain from participation. The present
      purpose was to examine coaches' expectations of what children should gain from
      participation in sport and the extent to which coaches believe that these
      expectations are actually fulfilled. Participants included 109 youth sport
      coaches who completed a survey packet consisting of a demographic information
      questionnaire and the Ohio Sport Satisfaction Index. Analysis indicated coaches
      ranked the variables of having fun, learning life skills, being part of a team,
      developing confidence, and the excitement of competition as the most important
      outcomes for the youth they coach. Generally, coaches believe that their
      expectations are being fulfilled. Coaches' sex and years of coaching were not
      significantly related to any of the criterion variables in the present study.

TI  - Biomechanics and motion analysis applied to sports.
PG  - 309-22
AB  - The development of motion analysis and the application of biomechanical analysis 
      techniques to sports has paralleled the exponential growth of computational and
      videographic technology. Technological developments have provided for advances in
      the investigation of the human body and the action of the human body during
      sports believed to be unobtainable a few years ago. Technological advancements
      have brought biomechanical applications into a wide range of fields from
      orthopedics to entertainment. An area that has made tremendous gains using
      biomechanics is sports science. Coaches, therapists, and physicians are using
      biomechanics to improve performance, rehabilitation, and the prevention of sports
      related injuries. Functional analyses of athletic movements that were impossible 
      a few years ago are available and used today. With new advancements, the
      possibilities for investigating the way a human interacts and reacts to
      environmental conditions are ever expanding.

TI  - Coaches' attitudes toward smokeless tobacco and intentions to intervene with
      athletes.
PG  - 89-94
AB  - Smokeless tobacco use among athletes is alarming. Most of these athletes report
      beginning smokeless tobacco use in middle or high school. West Virginia has
      significantly higher rates of smokeless tobacco use among adolescent and adult
      males than the general population. Since West Virginia athletes may be
      particularly vulnerable to smokeless tobacco use, West Virginia coaches can be
      critical agents in smokeless tobacco prevention and intervention. This study
      surveyed West Virginia middle and high school coaches' 1) attitudes toward
      smokeless tobacco, 2) actions toward athletes who use smokeless tobacco, 3)
      intentions to provide intervention for users, and 4) tobacco use history. Results
      indicated coaches had unfavorable attitudes toward smokeless tobacco, perceived
      it as a problem, and were willing to help athletes quit. These findings provide
      support for development of training programs for middle and high school coaches
      to act as smokeless tobacco intervention agents.

TI  - Adolescents and sports: risk or benefit?
PG  - 161-6
AB  - In order to begin to compensate for a lack of data on the effects of athletic
      participation in the development of adolescent mental health patterns, as well as
      to assess general health of the adolescent population, the Juvenile Wellness and 
      Health Inventory (JWHS-76) was administered to 1,769 high school students. Our
      results indicate that sports participation is associated with self-reported lower
      total risk scores, mental and physical health benefits, and an increased risk of 
      injury. This suggests a positive role for organized sports participation in youth
      populations. Prospective studies are needed to assess the impact of different
      sports, mounting performance pressure, and transition into collegiate levels of
      participation.

PG  - 1139-45
AB  - In our society, athletes project the ultimate image of well being in the health
      status spectrum. Though very uncommon, the sudden death of a young athlete has
      always great impact on the community and the athlete's surroundings (physicians, 
      athletes, coaches, etc.). Due both to this and to the growing number of physical 
      exercise practitioners, there is an increasing demand for more and precise
      information on the recommendations of participation in certain sports with the
      minimum possible risk. Together with the most recent and detailed statistics
      concerning the cardiovascular causes of sudden death in athletes, the objective
      of the present article is to review the present controversy regarding the
      preparticipation medical examination as a useful method to identify those
      athletes with greater potential risk, as well as to propose a few and simple
      recommendations concerning the tests that should be performed in each case.

AB  - For the millions of people in the world with special needs, dental care is
      usually not a priority, often taking a back seat to more pressing and complicated
      medical issues. This article offers a brief overview of the integration of a
      dental program into the Special Olympics organization. This overview is followed 
      by a discussion on dental education with regard to people with special needs, and
      then reviews measures for the prevention of injuries.

TI  - Motivational climate and goal orientations as predictors of perceptions of
      improvement, satisfaction and coach ratings among tennis players.
PG  - 381-8
AB  - One purpose of this work was to study the relationship of goal orientations and
      the perceived motivational climate created by the coach in relation to 219
      competitive Spanish tennis players': a) perceived improvement in different facets
      of the game, b) satisfaction with their competitive results, overall level of
      play, and coach, and c) ratings of their coach. The second purpose was to examine
      whether the dependent variables were best predicted by the perceived
      situationally emphasized goal structure created by the coach and/or the athletes'
      dispositional goal perspective. Intermediate (N=70), advanced (N=124), and
      professional (N=25) level players completed Spanish versions of the TEOSQ and the
      PMCSQ-2 and items assessing perceived improvement specific to tennis,
      satisfaction and coach ratings. The results were consistent with the tenets of
      goal perspective theory and provide further support for the promotion of a task
      involving atmosphere in sport.

TI  - The prevention of ankle sprains in sports. A systematic review of the literature.
PG  - 753-60
AB  - To assess the published evidence on the effectiveness of various approaches to
      the prevention of ankle sprains in athletes, we used textbooks, journals, and
      experts in the field of sports medicine to identify citations. We identified 113 
      studies reporting the risk of ankle sprains in sports, methods to provide
      support, the effect of these interventions on performance, and comparison of
      prevention efforts. The most common risk factor for ankle sprain in sports is
      history of a previous sprain. Ten citations of studies involving athletes in
      basketball, football, soccer, or volleyball compared alternative methods of
      prevention. Methods tested included wrapping the ankle with tape or cloth,
      orthoses, high-top shoes, or some combination of these methods. Most studies
      indicate that appropriately applied braces, tape, or orthoses do not adversely
      affect performance. Based on our review, we recommend that athletes with a
      sprained ankle complete supervised rehabilitation before returning to practice or
      competition, and those athletes suffering a moderate or severe sprain should wear
      an appropriate orthosis for at least 6 months. Both coaches and players must
      assume responsibility for prevention of injuries in sports. Methodologic
      limitations of published studies suggested several areas for future research.

TI  - Sports medicine in the new millennium: a vision for 2020.
PG  - 145-9
AB  - Globalisation, empowerment and technological change will determine the emerging
      directions in sports medicine in the new millennium. Networks and alliances of
      scientist and clinician services, as well as electronic profiling of athletes'
      learning styles, genetic predisposition and other variables, will enhance the
      spectrum of sports medicine services. Visionary direction will require changes in
      the organisational paradigms employed, the communication of information to
      athletes and coaches and the methodologies of assessment. An emphasis on
      prevention science and clinical and educational interventions will require a
      clearer focus. The sports medicine scientist and clinician of today must utilise 
      the endowments suggested by Covey and the multiple intelligence models advanced
      by Gardner in capturing the clarity of focus for sports medicine in the new
      millennium.

TI  - Sport activity in adolescence: associations with health perceptions and
      experimental behaviours.
PG  - 225-33
AB  - Despite the relevance of this research topic from a public health perspective,
      there is currently a lack of objective data on European adolescents' sport
      activity, notably the associations between their sport habits and their health
      attitudes and behaviours, which may have important consequences both in terms of 
      somatic (cardiovascular) health and mental health. The objective of the present
      study was to determine the direction and strength of the associations between the
      frequency of sport and health variables; in particular, perceptions of health,
      self image, substance use and experimental behaviours. Data were collected as
      part of the 1993 Swiss Multicentric Adolescent Survey on Health. In this survey, 
      anonymous self-administered questionnaires were distributed to a national
      representative sample of 10,000 in-school adolescents (15-20 years of age).
      Univariate analyses explored the relationships between the level of sport
      activity and health variables; then logistic regression analyses examined the
      strength of these relationships. According to the results, half of the sample do 
      sports more than twice a week, boys more often as part of a sports club.
      Differences between non-athletic and athletic adolescents describe the latter as 
      having less somatic complaints, more confidence in their future health, a better 
      body image, a lesser tendency to attempt suicide, a higher frequency of use of
      the car seat belt, and a lower use of tobacco, wine and marijuana. Links between 
      the frequency of sport activity and the locus of control related to health,
      general satisfaction with life or sexual behaviours are less strong. It must be
      noticed that the cross-sectional data collection precludes the establishment of a
      causal relationship between exercise and health behaviours. However, the existing
      links underline the coexistence of positive health characteristics and sport
      activity, suggesting that an incitement to get involved in physical activity may 
      be a necessary component of a comprehensive prevention approach among
      adolescents.

TI  - Perceptions of the sport psychologist by female university athletes.
PG  - 205-12
AB  - In this study we explored the existence of a favourable attitude towards sport
      psychologists by female athletes in relation to other sport-oriented and mental
      health professionals. Ninety female student athletes made judgements of
      similarity between 11 practitioner terms using the triad method. A rank-order
      task was also completed, where the 11 professionals were ranked on three
      expertise variables in sporting, mental and physical issues. The results were
      analysed using (1) the metric scaling procedure of correspondence analysis, (2)
      cultural consensus analysis and (3) PROperty FITting analysis. A two-dimensional 
      solution provided the best interpretation of the similarity judgements. The
      correspondence analysis configuration positioned the sport psychologist centrally
      between a sport-oriented pair and the cluster of mental health professionals.
      Participants reported adequate consensus on all three expertise variables, which 
      is consistent with the assumptions of Cultural Consensus Theory. Consistent with 
      earlier research, the three variables were salient in the participants'
      similarity judgements of sport and mental health professionals. Our results
      suggest the existence of a more favourable perception of the sport psychologist
      and a distancing from a direct association with mental health practitioners.
      However, the centrality of the term may indicate a more cloudy distinction as to 
      where the sport psychologist exists in relation to other professionals.

PG  - 385-95
AB  - Efforts to increase the sun-protective behaviors of children were extended to
      outdoor recreational sports and youth soccer settings in this study. The pretest 
      results of a pilot survey of coaches (n = 12), parents (n = 50), and youths (n = 
      61) on eight soccer teams in south Georgia were used to guide the development of 
      a health education program for coaches. In the pilot programs, half the coaches
      were trained to be involved in soccer-playing youths' sun protection by acting as
      positive role models and promoting sun protection to youths and their parents.
      The pilot demonstrated coaches' willingness to participate in sun protection
      promotion to youth: Youths indicated that coaches and parents were more likely to
      tell youths to wear sunscreen after the training than before, and coaches
      perceived getting youths to wear sunscreen to be less difficult than before.

TI  - Imagery quality estimated by autonomic response is correlated to sporting
      performance enhancement.
PG  - 63-72
AB  - It is now well established that mental imagery practice improves motor skills,
      but performance efficiency depends on many factors: the main one being individual
      differences. The aim of this study is to evaluate performance improvement with
      imagery quality estimated during ANS recording. Volleyball training ("receiving
      serve") afforded us the experimental paradigm. Subjects were required to pass an 
      opponent's serve to a given team mate. The receiver's performance was evaluated
      from the accuracy of his pass to the targeted team mate. From these first test
      results, subjects were divided into two equivalent groups: imagers and controls. 
      After mental practice the two groups were submitted to a posttest similar to the 
      first one. During the pretest, posttest actual practice as well as the last
      session of corresponding mental rehearsal, six autonomic parameters were
      continuously recorded. Furthermore, and for the first time, a grade obtained from
      four different aspects of this response permits qualitative evaluation of each
      subject's mental imagery. This estimation, based on the well-established link
      between performance and autonomic response, is validated by the fact that good
      correlation was obtained between this grade and the performance improvement of
      each of the "imager" group subjects.

AB  - It is popular among modern scholars in the humanities to describe "myths" or
      "metaphors" that guide our lives and actions. The corporate literature calls
      these "paradigms." Whatever the terminology, people more or less consciously use 
      these types of mental structures to interpret events, set priorities, and
      interact with others. The metaphors that underlie sports medicine emphasize
      health, functional capacity, and human performance, and our ability to enhance
      and preserve these throughout life. They appeal to patients in much the same way 
      "complementary and alternative" therapies do; yet sports medicine is supported by
      the same scientific foundation as other medical disciplines.

PG  - 425-40, v
AB  - This chapter examines sports participation in the context of adolescent growth
      and development. Because the nature of sports participation is highly organized
      and competitive, it is imperative that parents, coaches, physicians, and other
      clinicians remember that they may be placing increased pressures on the
      adolescent to perform and practice. The authors review the impact of physical
      growth and psychosocial development and also describe how substance abuse,
      depression, and aggressive behavior may or may not be influenced by sports
      participation.

TI  - A developmental and psychoeducational approach to reducing conflict and abuse in 
      little league and youth sports. The sport psychiatrist's role.
PG  - 891-918
AB  - To stress a point made earlier, whether backyard or Little League, the tone of
      the youth sports experience is greatly influenced by the player and team
      selection process. All possible steps should therefore be taken to ensure that
      the draft is held on high moral ground, and that the adult participants, even on 
      the Major Little League level, behave cooperatively rather than competitively. If
      it is the community's hope that Little League will "build character, and not
      characters," it must embrace Shields and Bredemeier's work and flood the Draft
      Room with the four virtues of compassion, fairness, sportspersonship, and
      integrity. In one attempt to achieve fairness and balance, some leagues enter
      player evaluations into a data base and allow a properly programmed computer to
      project equal teams. It might be best, however, to borrow a page from backyard
      baseball, and make team selection a more cooperative venture. Wolff has proposed 
      such a draft model. He recommends that each child's name be placed on a big
      blackboard at the beginning of the draft. All assembled give their assessment of 
      each child's baseball ability, and a consensus skill-level number (one through
      five) is entered next to each player's name. If there are 72 names, and the
      league wishes to form six teams of 12 players each, dividing up the rated players
      so that the skill levels balance would assure everyone (coaches, parents, the
      league, and by extension, the community) that the teams were of relatively equal 
      strength. No coach at this point would know to which team he or she was being
      assigned, so there would be no motive for "stacking" a given team. Each team
      would be designated by a letter of the alphabet, and the six letters would be
      thrown into a hat. The six coaches would then blindly pick a team from the hat.
      If a coach desired that his or her child play on his or her team, fair
      adjustments (trades) could be made subject to majority agreement. The three draft
      models can be summarized as follows: Draft Model 1 Public tryouts Previous year
      rating Coach makes selections Can be very competitive, lacking in "character" Can
      result in very unequal teams Draft Model 2 Player evaluations placed into a data 
      base Properly programmed computer projects equal teams Draft Model 3 All names
      placed on a blackboard Relative merits of players discussed Equal team drawn up
      and placed into a hat Adjustments can be made for coach's child If practical,
      this author suggests that coaches not pick a name for the team until the first
      team meeting or practice, when that task can be given to the children. In a
      symbolic way, this returns some of the sport to them while encouraging social
      interaction among new teammates, and helping the coach detect who the leaders
      are. Names of professional teams in the major sports, especially baseball, are to
      be avoided, as they fuel longstanding unconscious associations and fantasies, and
      may subtly tilt all participants toward the professional "win at all costs"
      mentality. No one draft model is perfect for every town, and even the most
      ethical attempt to achieve balance among teams can be severely tested by parents 
      who request that their athlete be placed on the same team as another child for
      social or car pool reasons. Such requests are not inviolate, however. For
      example, they do not usually dictate placement in school classes, and car pools
      are frequently disrupted when children, in individual sports such as Tae Kwan Do,
      reach different ability levels, and so attend practices at different times.
      Baseball is no longer the national pasttime and, as we approach the millennium,
      American children have too many other attractive, competing interests and time
      demands to spontaneously organize a pick-up game. One coach shared with the
      author that his saddest moment in CAP League came when he arrived at 6 PM at a
      field that had been "reserved" for his team, and found a group of boys who were
      playing a pick-up game. The coach's impulse was to set his boys fre

AB  - Relationship violations have been documented in all service professions,

      the coach-athlete relationship is not a typical therapeutic interaction, there
      should be professional and ethical boundaries. Boundary violations, including
      sexual abuse of a minor, do occur. Five clinical cases of relationship
      disturbances are presented. The authors use the paradigms of transference,
      countertransference, and achievement by proxy distortion to discuss these
      worrisome vignettes. Colleagues are encouraged to collaborate in an effort to
      develop awareness and prevention programs through research and education.
      Developing an enlarged workbook of similar case studies for use as a stimulus for
      seminars and discussions in training environments is an immediate goal.

AB  - The role of the sport psychiatrist consulting to a professional sports team is
      complex, challenging, and varied. Sport psychiatrists enhance the psychosocial
      development of the athlete by removing obstacles to growth and by facilitating
      lines of communication that support exchange of information, sharing of feelings,
      and the development of solid winning relationships on the team and throughout the
      organization. The consultant psychiatrist often provides input both to players
      and to management, however; these dual responsibilities raise ethical concerns
      and often require the services of additional treating psychiatrists and other
      mental health professionals.

      children and adolescents with developmental disabilities. Although much work
      remains, exercise and sports are associated with reduced maladaptive behavior in 
      children with disabilities, as well as with improved physical fitness,
      self-esteem, and social competence. Improved physical and psychosocial
      functioning are found in studies of both children and adults with mental
      retardation, as well as in research on athletes enrolled in Special Olympics
      International, the largest recreational sport program in the world for persons
      with developmental disabilities. The review ends with recommendations for
      promoting recreation and sports in children and adolescents with disabilities.

PG  - 725-44, vii
AB  - Societal and familial forces of enormous emotional intensity have contributed to 
      the growth of youth sports during the twentieth century, and continue to affect
      adult participation in children's athletics. This article addresses the
      historical evolution of youth sport programs, then identifies opportunities for
      adults to facilitate developmental progress and surmount emotional obstacles as
      they interact in sport activities with children ranging from preschool ages
      through adolescence. Youth sports are viewed as offering tremendous opportunities
      to teach not only physical skills and playing strategies, but also psychological 
      skills and coping strategies that have applicability throughout life. A
      developmental rationale is provided to support recommendations for parents and
      coaches. Child and adolescent psychiatrists are faced with the challenge of
      collaborating with other professionals and making their knowledge base available 
      to the volunteers who coach in and support youth sport programs.

AB  - At first glance, the idea of having automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) at
      sports events may seem curious, since spectator sports are the domain of young,
      healthy athletes. Yet athletes are not entirely free of cardiac risk. More
      important, there are many other people at sports events (officials, coaches,
      fans) who are at risk for cardiac arrest. In just one example, baseball umpire
      John McSherry suffered a fatal heart attack before a national TV audience during 
      the Cincinnati Reds' home opener in April 1996.

AB  - The authors assessed high-school athletic coaches' perceptions about oral-facial 
      injuries and mouthguard use in sports that do not mandate mouthguard use. About
      72 percent of the coaches said that their athletes sustained oral-facial
      injuries, 28 percent that some athletes used mouthguards regularly, 48 percent
      that athletes had sustained injuries and did not use mouthguards regularly, and
      31 percent said they would not encourage mouthguard use. Advocacy for mouthguard 
      use should focus on coaches, coaches' associations and rule-making organizations.

TI  - [Can sports injuries be prevented? Troubling shortage of controlled trials on the
      effects of prevention].
PG  - 4244-6, 4248
AB  - A review of literature on the prevention of sports injuries shows many preventive
      measures to have been suggested, but few clinical trials to have been performed. 
      A database search yielded only seven prospective, randomised studies, of which
      two showed soccer and running injuries to be preventable using a combination of
      preventive measures. Other clinical trials have shown it possible to prevent
      certain types of injury in other sports as well. The use of prophylactic ankle
      stabilisers and/or proprioceptive ankle disc training to reduce the incidence of 
      ankle sprain is well documented. Of two studies presenting preventive measures to
      reduce the incidence of knee ligament injuries, one showed the risk of knee
      sprain in American football to be reducible by means of a knee brace, and the
      other that the risk of anterior cruciate ligament injuries in soccer could be
      reduced by proprioceptive training. Several commonly used preventive measures,
      such as stretching, taping, mental training and controlled rehabilitation, still 
      await further documentation or the scrutiny of a clinical trial.

TI  - Practical knowledge in expert coaches: on-site study of coaching in sailing.
PG  - 254-66
AB  - The purpose of this study was to analyze the practical knowledge of expert
      sailing coaches of the French team preparing for the 1996 Olympic Games in
      Atlanta. Coaching knowledge was studied from a cognitive ergonomics perspective
      based on the task activity model. According to this model, a task is a set of
      constraints facing individuals. To meet the demands imposed by these constraints,
      an individual engages in an adaptative activity which can be studied from the
      point of view of his or her knowledge and cognitive operating modes. In-depth
      interviews were conducted after observation of five training sessions, and the
      verbal protocols obtained were coded inductively. The results showed that
      coaching tasks were considered by coaches as a set of interacting constraints
      which generate complex, contradictory, and ill defined problems. Coaches'
      operating modes appeared to be based on organization routines, cognitive
      anticipation on flexible plans, flexible on-site adaptation, joint control of
      training with athletes, and involvement in the training situation based on past
      experiences.

TI  - Gender differences in preferences for coaching as an occupation: the role of

PG  - 188-200
AB  - This study investigated gender differences in the role of self-efficacy,
      occupational valence, valence of coaching, and perceived barriers in preference
      to coach at the high school, 2-year college, Division III, Division II, and
      Division I levels. The participants, 191 Big Ten university basketball players
      (94 men, 97 women), responded to a specially constructed instrument. The genders 
      did not differ in their coaching self-efficacy, preferred occupational valence,
      and perceived barriers. Relative to men, women perceived greater valence in
      coaching (p < .001). Women with a female coach perceived greater valence in
      coaching (p < .05) and expressed less concern with perceived discrimination (p < 
      .05) than those with a male coach. Perceived self-efficacy and preferred
      occupational valence were differentially related to the desire to coach at
      various levels. Working Hours most negatively affected the desire to coach at
      every level (R > .20).

TI  - The development of guidelines for the management of concussion in sports.
PG  - 53-65
AB  - Concussion in sports has caught the attention of the news media in recent years, 
      primarily due to the high profile of certain athletes who have sustained
      traumatic brain injuries. Even though the management of concussion remains
      somewhat controversial, certain principles of neuroscience regarding mental
      status alterations and other symptoms resulting from concussion are well accepted
      by medical experts. Several authors have previously published management
      strategies for sports-related concussion based on their own experiences, but this
      article will describe the formal process of developing guidelines for the
      diagnosis and management of concussion in sports. The processes of literature
      review, evidence-based analysis, and consensus building are described. This
      article includes the grading scale, sideline evaluation, and management strategy 
      adopted as a practice parameter by the American Academy of Neurology. Emphasis is
      placed on the need to detect mild forms of concussion through detailed
      observation and examination of athletes.

TI  - Skill acquisition in sport: some applications of an evolving practice ecology.
PG  - 621-40
AB  - This paper builds on recent theoretical concerns regarding traditional
      conceptualizations of the skill acquisition process. The implications for the
      process of practice in sport contexts are explored with reference to the
      information-processing approach to motor behaviour and the newer ecological
      paradigm. Issues are raised with current principles of practice based on
      traditional theoretical ideas. A practice strategy that gives greater weight to
      the guided exploration of the practice workspace jointly defined by the
      properties of the individual's subsystems, the specific task and the environment 
      is advocated. Such a constraints-led perspective supersedes previous distinctions
      between rudimentary and voluntary skills. Sports scientists, coaches, teachers
      and movement rehabilitation therapists are invited to review current practices in
      the light of recent theoretical advances from the ecological perspective.

TI  - [Value of sports in treatment of psychiatric illness].
PG  - 379-93
AB  - Several studies in healthy volunteers have shown a positive effect of endurance
      training on anxiety, depressive symptoms, self-esteem, concentration and stress
      tolerance. There are only a few controlled studies examining the therapeutic
      potential of exercise in psychiatric disorders. However, there is good evidence
      that exercise is effective in mild to moderate depression and in anxiety
      disorders. The therapeutic effect did not correlate with changes in
      cardiopulmonary fitness in the majority of studies. Therefore, other
      neurobiological and psychological mechanisms are discussed which might explain
      the effectiveness of regular physical training. The authors offer a variety of
      suggestions, how exercise could be integrated and evaluated in the treatment of
      psychiatric disorders.

TI  - Coping with performance slumps: factor analysis of the Ways of Coping in Sport
      Scale.
PG  - 99-105
AB  - The measurement properties of the Ways of Coping in Sport Scale (WOCS) were
      examined using performance slumps as a frame of reference. Confirmatory factor
      analysis failed to support the factor structure previously proposed by Madden et 
      al. (1987, 1989, 1990), and additional analyses were undertaken to develop and
      validate an alternative model. Results indicated that the data best fit a
      4-factor model, but that a 5-factor model might also be justified. Relevant
      factors included Seeking of Social Support, Denial/Avoidance, Wishful Thinking,
      Effort/Resolve, and Emotional Control. Discussion focuses on the implications of 
      these findings for athletes, coaches and sport psychologists as well as the need 
      for further examination of slump-related coping instruments.

TI  - Knowledge and reported use of sport science by elite New Zealand Olympic class
      sailors.
PG  - 213-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study enquired about the knowledge and reported use of sport
      science in elite Olympic class sailors. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The sailors
      responded to a simple questionnaire. SETTING: The questionnaire was administered 
      as part of an introductory seminar on sport science during a training camp.
      PARTICIPANTS: The participants were 28 (22 male, 6 female) elite New Zealand
      Olympic class sailors. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASURES: The questionnaire asked
      whether or not they used a training race diary, enquired about their current and 
      past injuries and their knowledge and use of sport science in the areas of
      nutrition, psychology and physical training. RESULTS: Only ten (36%) of the
      sailors kept a training/race diary. Whilst only four (14%) had a current injury, 
      sixteen (57%) reported an injury in the previous three years. The injuries were
      in the lower back (45%), knee (22%), shoulder (18%), and arm (15%). Although
      nineteen (68%) of the sailors had experienced dehydration during racing, the
      average volume of fluid reported to be taken on a four hour sail was only 0.9
      litre, of which only an average of 0.7 litres (77%) was reported to be drunk. All
      the sailors reported being sometimes (46%) to very often (3%) anxious before
      races and sometimes (43%) to always (7%) being frustrated with their own
      mistakes. Only one sailor reported never having negative thoughts whilst fifteen 
      (53%) reported having them sometimes, and seven (25%) often or very often.
      Twenty-four (86%) of the sailors reported that they sometimes had a loss of
      concentration near the end of the race. Whilst eighteen (64%) reported practising
      relaxation and seventeen (61%) reported practising visualisation as a mental
      skill, only five (18%) practised progressive mental relaxation, two (7%)
      practised meditation and none practised yoga. Seventeen (61%) undertook
      strength/circuit training, ten (36%) flexibility and twenty-one (75%) off water
      aerobic training. Twenty-four (86%) reported undertaking on-water aerobic
      training. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that there is considerable scope for 
      improvement in the knowledge and use of sports science amongst elite New Zealand 
      Olympic class sailors.

TI  - Family physicians and sports-injury care. Perceptions of coaches.
PG  - 1755-61
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe coaches' education in injury care and management and their
      club's access to medical care, to describe coaches' perceptions of how family
      physicians care for sports injuries, and to describe strategies used for
      overcoming perceived poor advice. DESIGN: A telephone survey using both closed
      and open-ended questions was conducted. Information was collected as background
      information to a larger study investigating coaches' decisions about allowing
      injured athletes to compete. SETTING: All 28 competitive gymnastics clubs in the 
      province of Alberta. The clubs trained athletes for all competitive levels.
      PARTICIPANTS: All 70 coaches registered with the Alberta Gymnastics Federation as
      working with female gymnasts were approached; 64 coaches were interviewed. MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Injury education, access to medical care, perceptions of
      sports-injury treatment provided by family physicians, strategies employed for
      overcoming perceived poor advice. RESULTS: Education in injury care and
      management was varied, as was access to medical care. Direct access to
      sport-specific medical care was available at three of the five elite-level clubs,
      an arrangement stemming from dissatisfaction with the conventional health care
      system. At all competitive levels, most coaches were dissatisfied with the
      recommendations they received from family physicians. Various strategies were
      employed to acquire more suitable advice. CONCLUSIONS: The results point to a
      need for improved communication between family physicians and coaches.

PG  - 219-28
AB  - Beliefs, attitudes, and nutrition resource use among high school wrestling
      coaches were measured for weight loss, weight class, dehydration, training diet, 
      and eating disorders. Most coaches (82%) considered themselves very knowledgeable
      about wrestling but less informed about sport nutrition, weight loss, and vitamin
      supplements. They used a variety of nutrition resources, but only 36% had
      attended nutrition workshops. Almost all coaches were interested in learning more
      about specific nutrition topics. More experienced coaches attended nutrition
      workshops and felt more informed about weight loss and sport nutrition. The mean 
      percentage of correct responses to questions about weight loss was 64%, training 
      diets 59%, dehydration 57%, body composition 52%, and eating disorders 80%; the
      mean score for healthy attitudes about weight loss was 69%, training diets 34%,
      dehydration 29%, body composition 70%, and eating disorders 69%. These results
      can be used to develop training seminars and educational materials to promote
      greater knowledge and healthy attitudes among wrestling coaches.

TI  - Fluid balance in team sports. Guidelines for optimal practices.
PG  - 38-54
AB  - Team sports require players to perform multiple work bouts at near maximal
      effort, punctuated with intervals of low intensity exercise or rest for the
      duration of a game. Such activity patterns are associated with a significant loss
      of body water which has a negative impact on physical and mental performance, as 
      well as temperature regulation. There are a number of ways in which sweat losses 
      incurred during team sports differ from those measured during prolonged,
      continuous exercise. Firstly, the work rate in team sports is intermittent,
      largely unpredictable and random in nature. Second, analyses of various team
      sports reveal that such games are characterised by a high degree of inter and
      intra-individual variability in work rates between players from the same sport.
      Finally, team players are less able to anticipate sweat losses than athletes
      competing in events which involve prolonged, continuous, moderate intensity
      exercise. Yet, compared with most endurance events, many team sports offer
      frequent opportunities to ingest adequate volumes of fluid and thus prevent
      exercise-induced hypohydration. The present review details the findings of modern
      studies which have determined body water losses and fluid intake practices of
      athletes from a variety of team sports. Special considerations which influence
      sweat loss and fluid intake that are unique to team sports are discussed, and
      guidelines for sound hydration strategies during training and competition are
      provided.

TI  - [General practitioners and doping in sports: knowledge and attitudes].
PG  - 145-56
AB  - Most campaigns of prevention from doping (use of certain substances by athlete
      that could have an effect like an artificial improvement of his (or her) physical
      and/or mental conditions) have been relied on the physicians considered as main
      actors in this field. However do the physicians have the necessary knowledge and 
      attitudes and do they simply wish to take part pertinently in actions of doping
      prevention? This study has been conducted in order to examine their knowledge and
      attitudes in front of doping, to evaluate their role in the prevention campaign. 
      So 280 french physicians have randomly been selected and interviewed by
      telephone. The response rate was about 62%. The selected population was made up
      of 173 physicians in which were 122 males and 51 females, the average age was
      44.5 +/- 6.5 years. The questioned physicians seemed to have a few knowledge
      about doping, in particular through the eight families of prohibited substances
      in which they only mentioned anabolic steroids and amphetamines. Only 50% of them
      think doping can also concern children, therefore 33.6% had have to face this
      problem in the latest 12 months. For 86.5% of the questioned physicians, doping
      is a serious public health problem and 60% of them consider it as a kind of drug 
      addiction. According to 60.9% of them, campaigns of prevention from doping are
      inefficient; and 92.5% would like to take part in it but 83.3% of them do not
      feel themselves prepared enough. The results are always similar with or without
      sports medicine diploma. Three different families of the physicians' attitudes
      are described. The physicians' involvement in doping prevention claims an action 
      in two parts: to change their behaviours facing to doping they have to consider
      as any health issue, to provide them with prevention efficient "tools" for their 
      sports patients. At last, considering doping as a public health issue and not
      only as a marginal practice restricted to the athletic elite is really essential.

TI  - The economic impact on families of children's participation in junior sport.
PG  - 27-33
AB  - The study investigated the socio-economic consequences for families of
      participation in junior sport. Two hundred and twenty families in Queensland and 
      Victoria were surveyed from the sports of cricket, Australian football,
      gymnastics, hockey, netball and tennis and twenty seven of these interviewed. The
      study showed that parents make a substantial contribution in terms of financial
      support to their children's participation in junior sport. Each of the sports
      mode different financial demands on families depending on the yearly cycle of
      training and competition, distance from facilities and coaching, costs associated
      with coaching, equipment and uniforms, and representative level. It is concluded 
      that family income and structure are the key factors in determining the
      likelihood of a child's involvement in junior sport, and that for many Australian
      children, financial factors may be barriers to their participation in junior
      sport.

TI  - Olympic athletes' transition from sport to workplace.
PG  - 1287-95
AB  - Research has supported the need for strategies to assist elite athletes with
      transition from full-time athletic activity to the work place. Early intervention
      with coaches' and peers' support programs have mediated the problems associated
      with the termination of athletic careers. The present study is a report about 57 
      prominent Olympians from 12 disciplines spanning 6 0 years of competitive sports.
      Analysis of the data suggests that focussed efforts early in the athletes'
      careers assisted preparation for life after the full athletic activity. Mentors
      not only assist in the athletes' careers but also offer guidance and counsel
      during later life.

TI  - Psychological rehabilitation from sports injuries.
PG  - 333-9
AB  - Medical professionals realise the importance of incorporating psychological
      strategies into rehabilitation from athletic injury, but often feel they lack the
      knowledge to do so. This paper explores the role which psychology can play when
      injured athletes are rehabilitating. Rehabilitation from sport injury involves
      not only physical, but psychological considerations. Topics include: the
      post-injury emotional and cognitive reactions of athletes, the importance of
      social support, the athlete's attitude toward recovery, the therapist's,
      physician's and coach's roles during rehabilitation, strategies to increase
      adherence, and effective communication between client and medical professionals. 
      Considerations for returning to practice and competition are also discussed.

TI  - Doping control in sports--a perspective from the 1996 Olympic Games.
PG  - 1053-7
AB  - Doping-control (DC) procedures, particularly as used at the 1996 Olympic Games,
      are described, and the role of pharmacists in DC is discussed. DC procedures must
      be strict and precisely followed to avoid contamination of samples, the
      appearance of bias, and breaches in security and confidentiality. The process of 
      selecting athletes for testing can be random, nonrandom, or a combination of the 
      two. Escorts are used to notify athletes of their selection, verify their
      identity, and accompany them to the DC station. When urine specimens are obtained
      for DC, the voiding process must be directly observed. The specimen is checked
      for pH and specific gravity and then processed for shipping to a laboratory to be
      analyzed for banned substances. Medication histories are also obtained, giving
      athletes the opportunity to declare any substance that has been taken for
      legitimate medical purposes. Laboratory analysis involves screening and
      confirmation phases. During the Atlanta Games, roughly 50 pharmacists
      participated in the DC program as escorts or technical officers. It is logical to
      involve pharmacists in DC programs because they can develop and conduct
      drug-testing protocols; educate athletes, coaches, and trainers about drug use
      and abuse; and help ensure the safe and effective use of medications.
      Sophisticated doping-control procedures have been developed for athletic
      competitions, and pharmacists have much to offer DC programs.

TI  - Sport-related hematuria: a review.
PG  - 119-25
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present an overview and models of the potential causes and
      implications of sport-related hematuria in an athletic population as provided by 
      a literature review. DATA SOURCES: A total of 64 published scientific articles
      have been utilized to provide a review of sport-related hematuria. STUDY
      SELECTION: Reviewed studies were selected on the basis that they provided
      informative findings about the possible mechanisms of sport-related hematuria
      attributed to exercise duration and intensity. These studies used both normal
      adult and athletic populations. DATA EXTRACTION: A review of the literature on
      the potential mechanisms of sport-related hematuria led to the classification of 
      these mechanisms as either exercise duration related or exercise intensity
      related. DATA SYNTHESIS: Research has revealed an increased prevalence of
      hematuria in athletes. The mechanisms responsible may be traced to different
      sources or a combination thereof. Many explanations have been directed toward a
      potential cause; foot-strike hemolysis, renal ischemia, hypoxic damage to the
      kidney, the release of a hemolyzing factor, bladder and/or kidney trauma,
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, dehydration, increased circulation rate,
      myoglobinuria release, and the peroxidation of red blood cells. These mechanisms 
      are presented in two models depicting the influence of either exercise intensity 
      or exercise duration on sport-related hematuria. CONCLUSIONS: Athletes, coaches, 
      and sports medicine professionals should be aware of this condition because
      frequent high-intensity and/or long-duration workouts and competitions may
      promote the symptoms. Repeated red blood cell loss through the urine may be a
      contributing factor toward promoting anemic conditions in competitive athletes.
      Recognition of the potential mechanisms can spare the time and expense of
      invasive testing.

TI  - Sports-related recurrent brain injuries--United States.
PG  - 224-7
AB  - An estimated 300,000 sports-related traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) of mild to
      moderate severity, most of which can be classified as concussions (i.e.,
      conditions of temporarily altered mental status as a result of head trauma),
      occur in the United States each year. The proportion of these concussions that
      are repeat injuries is unknown; however, there is an increased risk for
      subsequent TBI among persons who have had at least one previous TBI. Repeated
      mild brain injuries occurring over an extended period (i.e., months or years) can
      result in cumulative neurologic and cognitive deficits, but repeated mild brain
      injuries occurring within a short period (i.e., hours, days, or weeks) can be
      catastrophic or fatal. The latter phenomenon, termed "second impact syndrome",
      has been reported more frequently since it was first characterized in 1984. This 
      report describes two cases of second impact syndrome and presents recommendations
      developed by the American Academy of Neurology to prevent recurrent brain
      injuries in sports and their adverse consequences.

TI  - Sport psychiatry in childhood and adolescence: an overview.
PG  - 71-88
AB  - This review explores the importance and relevance of sport during childhood and
      adolescence, utilizing traditional stage theories of development. The literature 
      supports the notion that sport is a necessary study as a health issue and a
      preventative tool in the field of psychiatry. Play and sport in childhood and
      adolescence enhance development physically, mentally, and socially. Participating
      in athletics encourages the development of leadership skills, self-esteem, muscle
      development and overall physical health. There is a lack of literature in the
      important area of sport psychiatry especially when considering beneficial, not
      deficit oriented youth athletic development. Child psychiatrists need to begin
      researching sport in order to develop a comprehensive understanding of how
      athletics can enhance the mental and physical health of youth.

TI  - High-level athlete's impressions of their preparticipation sports examination.
PG  - 291-2
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To document the high-level athletes' impressions of their
      preparticipation examination (PE). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Prospective study by
      self-reporting questionnaire. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: One hundred-fifty French 
      athletes, involved in national or international-level events (PE is obligatory
      every year in France). Response rate obtained was 71%. Subject population
      consisted of 107 normal, healthy, elite athletes, ranging in age from 16 to 31
      years (mean 22.4 years), included 69 males and 38 females. MEASURES: Knowledge
      and impression of PE, based upon the athletes' own experience. All of the
      consulted physician were trained and qualified in sports medicine. RESULTS:
      Thirty-six percent of the athletes reported having had bad-quality
      preparticipation sports visit (no significant difference between gender or age). 
      According to them, medical history taking was "poor", and physical examination
      "restricted to blood pressure measurement" and/or "chest listening" and "not
      targeted enough on past athletic injuries". Athletes said PE should especially
      evaluate the cardiovascular system (75% of all citations to the item), the
      musculoskeletal system (16%) and the lungs (8%), and should involve an
      electrocardiogram (41%). CONCLUSIONS: Challenges for the future: 1) better
      educate physician in sport, to improve the preventive aspects of sports medicine 
      2) physicians should provide information to coaches and athletes concerning the
      optimal balance between health and physical performance, and therefore to the
      interest of PE.

TI  - Effects of mental practice on performance are moderated by cognitive anxiety as
      measured by the Sport Competition Anxiety Test.
PG  - 1375-83
AB  - 45 subjects were assessed for cognitive anxiety on the Sport Competition Anxiety 
      Test. Two months later they observed a person performing a new motor task which
      required high cognitive processing to be performed well. After this observation, 
      22 subjects were randomly assigned to a Mental Practice and 23 to a Control
      group. The former performed a cognitive rehearsal of the task, whereas the latter
      did not. None practiced the task physically before being tested. Analysis of
      variance showed that both errors and performance time interacted significantly
      with Mental Practice versus Control group scores and scores on the Sport
      Competition Anxiety Test. Among subjects who practiced mentally, those scoring
      low on cognitive anxiety performed significantly better than subjects who scored 
      high. Further, the relationship between test scores of cognitive anxiety and
      performance for the total sample was analysed by different curvilinear regression
      models. The cubic model fitted the data better and accounted for a greater
      percent of variance on error performance explained by anxiety test scores (R =
      .39) than the linear correlation (r = .25). This cubic model formed a polynomial 
      relationship between cognitive anxiety test scores and error in performance.

TI  - Male adolescents' reactions to TV beer advertisements: the effects of sports
      content and programming context.
PG  - 425-33
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examines white male adolescent responses to TV beer
      advertisements with and without sports content and to nonbeer ads when embedded
      in sports and entertainment programming. METHOD: A total of 72 advertisements and
      24 television program excerpts were randomly sampled from national television
      programming. White male adolescents (N = 157) recruited in a public school system
      each viewed six ads (one of each of three types of ad embedded in each of two
      types of programming) comprising the 2 x 2 x 3 factorial, within-subjects,
      mixed-model (random and fixed effects) experimental design along with an
      age-level blocking factor and random factors for commercial and program stimuli. 
      Cognitive responses to each ad were content-analyzed. Individual difference
      variables including alcohol use behavior, sensation-seeking, masculinity and
      sports involvement were also measured. RESULTS: Subjects showed a consistent
      preference for beer ads with sports content. A significant three-way interaction 
      between ad type, programming type and junior versus senior high-school age level 
      also indicated that sports programming had an inconsistent effect on responses to
      beer ads but that nonbeer ads were responded to more positively during sports
      than during entertainment programming. Other analyses showed that subjects were
      more cognitively resistant to beer ads than to nonbeer ads. CONCLUSIONS: These
      results support public and official concerns that sports content in beer ads
      increase the ads appeal to underage youth. They do not support hypothesized
      concerns that sports programming might prime adolescents to be more receptive to 
      beer ads. Implications for alcohol education efforts are discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Regular physical activity may have psychological benefits. Our study 
      assessed the association between extent of participation in regular sport or
      vigorous recreational activity and emotional wellbeing in adolescents aged 16
      years. METHODS: Data were collected from a cohort of adolescents, born between
      April 5 and April 11, 1970, in England, Scotland, and Wales, who took part in the
      follow-up assessment at age 16 years. Emotional wellbeing was assessed by the
      general health questionnaire (GHQ) and the malaise inventory (divided into
      psychological and somatic subscales). Information was obtained about
      participation in ten team and 25 individual sports and vigorous recreational
      activities during the previous year. Non-vigorous recreations, such as darts and 
      snooker, were assessed separately. Social class and health status (recent illness
      and use of hospital services) were included in our analyses as possible
      confounding factors. 2223 boys and 2838 girls with a mean age of 16.3 years (SD
      0.38) were included in our analysis. Statistical analysis was by multiple linear 
      and logistic regression. FINDINGS: The sport and vigorous recreational activity
      index was positively associated with emotional wellbeing independently of sex,
      social class, health status, and use of hospital services. These associations
      were significant for the psychological symptom subscale of the malaise inventory 
      (regression coefficient -0.024, 95 percent Cl -0.036 to -0.011, p<0.001) and the 
      GHQ (odds ratio of emotional distress per unit increase in vigorous physical
      activity 0.992, 95 percent Cl 0.985-0.998, p<O.O1). By contrast, participation in
      non-vigorous activities was associated with high psychological and somatic
      symptoms on the malaise inventory. INTERPRETATION: We conclude that emotional
      wellbeing is positively associated with extent of participation in sport and
      vigorous recreational activity among adolescents. Although causal associations
      cannot be assumed in this cross-sectional analysis, our results are consistent
      with experimental evidence that vigorous exercise has favourable effects on
      emotional state.

AB  - Despite a growing body of evidence admonishing the behavior, weight cutting
      (rapid weight reduction) remains prevalent among wrestlers. Weight cutting has
      significant adverse consequences that may affect competitive performance,
      physical health, and normal growth and development. To enhance the education
      experience and reduce the health risks for the participants, the ACSM recommends 
      measures to educate coaches and wrestlers toward sound nutrition and weight
      control behaviors, to curtail "weight cutting," and to enact rules that limit
      weight loss.

TI  - Working with young athletes: views of a nutritionist on the sports medicine team.
PG  - 110-20
AB  - Athletes are influenced by coaches, other athletes, media, parents, the national 
      sport governing body, members of the sports medicine team, and the athlete's own 
      desire for success. It is impossible, therefore, for one member of the sports
      medicine team to unilaterally determine workable solutions that enhance
      performance and diminish health problems in an athlete. A focus on ensuring that 
      the athlete can perform to the best of her ability is a key to encouraging
      discussion between the nutritionist, athlete, and coach. Using the assumption
      that health and top athletic performance are compatible, this focus on
      performance provides a discussion point that all parties can agree to and, if
      approached properly, also fulfills the nutritionist's goal of achieving optimal
      nutritional status. Membership on the sports medicine team mandates that the
      nutritionist know the paradigms and health risks associated with the sport and
      develop assessment and feedback procedures specific to the athlete's needs.

TI  - [Sports therapy and rehabilitation sports--a health policy responsibility of
      rehabilitation].
PG  - 23-8
AB  - From a demographic and health policy perspective, movement and sports are gaining
      increased importance in terms of their preventive, therapeutic and rehabilitative
      potential. Successful use of sports therapy and rehabilitation sports in
      rehabilitating paraplegics, breast cancer patients, and patients with total hip
      replacement have provided convincing proof of their positive physical, mental and
      social impact, hence of the substantial contributions they are able to make
      towards enhancing specific parameters of the quality of life. It is assumed that 
      movement and sports are conducive in particular in chronic conditions, in line
      with the principle of "rehabilitation taking priority over care". Whether reduced
      health care spending will ensue, will in the final analysis have to be determined
      through controlled longitudinal studies, which have not been embarked upon as
      yet. Successful rehabilitation in this domain presupposes adequately qualified
      staffing in movement therapy-focussed rehabilitation facilities, both in- and
      out-patient, availability of an uninterrupted rehabilitation chain as well as
      appropriate follow-up for evaluation.

PG  - 331-9
AB  - Extended spaceflights seem to be similar to lengthy sport trials, in which top
      athletes are stressed by confinement and are still asked to maintain a high level
      of performance, staving off fatigue and performance decrements. The athletes use 
      coping strategies and recovery techniques in order to compensate for unexpected
      workoverload during sustained operation. Astronauts probably experience similar
      conditions, and they may use similar coping strategies and recovery techniques.
      Since sustained and continuous operation preferably affects the mental
      capabilities required for complex tasks, particular attention should be paid to
      decrements of mental and psychological performance and to techniques that could
      be used specifically for the recovery of a satisfactory level of performance.

      an injury, the Performance Enhancement Group program for injured athletes was
      created. This paper will offer a model for the Performance Enhancement Group
      program as a way to: 1) support the athlete, both mentally and physically; 2)
      deal with the demands of rehabilitation; and 3) facilitate the adjustments the
      athlete has to make while being out of the competitive arena. The program
      consists of responsibilities for professionals in sport psychology (ie,
      assessment/orientation, support, education, individual counseling, and
      evaluation) and athletic training (ie, organization/administration, recruitment
      and screening, support, application of techniques, and program compliance). The
      paper will emphasize that the success of the program is dependent on
      collaboration between professionals at all levels.

TI  - Sport specific fitness testing of elite badminton players.
PG  - 153-7
AB  - There is a scarcity of descriptive data on the performance capacity of elite
      badminton players, whose fitness requirements are quite specific. The purpose of 
      this paper is to investigate the physiological response of elite badminton
      players in a sport-specific fitness test. Twelve Hong Kong national badminton
      team players performed a field test on a badminton court. Six light bulbs were
      connected to a programming device causing individual bulbs to light up in a given
      sequence. The players were instructed to react to the flashes by running towards 
      them, and striking shuttles mounted in the vicinity of the bulbs. Exercise
      intensity was controlled by altering the interval between successive lightings. A
      low correlation (r = 0.65) was found between the results of the field test and
      the rank-order list of subjects, based on an objective on-field physiological
      assessment and subjective ranking. This may be explained by the requirements of
      other factors besides physical fitness which contribute to success in elite level
      badminton competition. These factors may include, for example, technical skill,
      mental power, and aesthetic judgements on the court. Maximum mean (s.d.) heart
      rate data (187(8) beats.min-1) and blood lactate values (10.4(2.9) mmol.l-1) in
      this study showed that players were under maximal load during the field test.
      From the testing data, it seems reasonable to speculate that the intensity of
      level 3 (20 light pulses.min-1; 3.0 s.pulse-1) and level 4 (22 light
      pulses.min-1; 2.7 s.pulse-1) simulates the requirement of actual games energy
      expenditure of the Hong Kong badminton players exercising at close to their
      anaerobic threshold. The results also show that an estimate of fitness can be
      derived from measurements involving exercise closely resembling that which is
      specific for the sports activity in question. Improved training advice and
      guidance may result from such studies.

AB  - Whether preparticipation sports examinations are necessary and what they should
      include are matters of debate, especially in the young because of the low yield
      of new medical diagnoses. The goal of the examining physician is to determine
      whether the athlete is mentally, developmentally, and physically capable of
      safely competing in recreational and competitive sports. We recommend that
      examinations precede the start of an activity by 4 to 6 weeks and be done every 3
      years. History taking should include parental input and a private interview with 
      the athlete when possible. The specific areas of the body to be used in a
      particular sport should be emphasized in the physical examination, and the amount
      of contact and energy required should be considered. Abnormal findings should be 
      thoroughly evaluated to rule out risk of injury or sudden death before approval
      to participate is granted.

OAB - AIDS: To settle a discrimination lawsuit, Campbell University agreed to pay
      $325,000 to a physical education instructor fired in 1993 after the university
      learned he had AIDS. Officials from the North Carolina university said the
      instructor, known as John Doe, posed a direct threat to students and himself. The
      Equal Employment Opportunities Commission (EEOC) sued in April 1994 on Doe's
      behalf, saying the university violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
      Doe's attorney also charged the university with violating the Rehabilitation Act 
      and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). According to EEOC
      officials, the university decided to settle after learning that medical experts
      were prepared to testify that Doe could perform his job without endangering
      anyone. As part of the settlement, Doe will return to the payroll, but at a new
      job which he developed. In addition, the university agreed to keep confidential
      the medical information of its employees, purge Doe's personnel file of any
      references to his medical condition or the discrimination complaint, and provide 
      AIDS awareness and sensitivity training to university managers and supervisors.

TI  - Transmission of blood-borne pathogens during sports: risk and prevention.
PG  - 283-5
AB  - Publicity about human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in athletes has
      focused attention on the potential for transmission of blood-borne pathogens
      during sports and athletic competitions. Existing information suggests that the
      potential risk for such transmission is extremely low and that the principal
      risks athletes have for acquiring HIV and hepatitis B virus are related to
      off-the-field activities. Therefore, efforts to prevent transmission of
      blood-borne pathogens among athletes should emphasize prevention in off-the-field
      settings. We summarize technical and other information about this issue, and
      provide recommendations for the education of sports participants, for infection
      control in athletic settings, and for training of coaches and officials.

AB  - In the framework of a project of the Northrhine-Westfalian disabled sports
      association, 42 multihandicapped residents of the von Bodelschwinghschen
      Anstalten Bethel participated in a sports medical study, with usefulness and need
      for sports medical examination and consultation clearly confirmed. Spirometric
      testing procedures were shown to require review. Close cooperation among staff,
      coaches as well as sports medical specialists is indispensable for ensuring
      meaningful implementation of the results as well as enhanced health through
      physical activity and sports.

PG  - 839-61
AB  - Through observations and perceptions of athletic directors/coaches, this study
      (1) broadly examined substance abuse of adolescent (high school)
      student-athletes; (2) made comparisons of substance abuse between
      student-athletes and students comprising the general student body; and (3) made
      selected comparisons of substance abuse between the regional data of this study
      and that of a national survey of high school coaches done by George H. Gallup
      International Institute (1991). Some comparisons were also made with the findings
      of a survey of drug use patterns among a sample of 10,883 public school students 
      conducted by the Alcohol and Drug Defense (ADD) Section, North Carolina
      Department of Public Instruction (1991; 1989; 1987a, 1987b) and a survey of drug 
      use patterns among 2,685 high school student-athletes (Shields, 1988). The drug
      abuse problem for student-athletes was observed-perceived to be of lesser
      magnitude regionally than nationally and to be less for student-athletes with
      their peers in the general student body. In virtually every comparison of
      student-athletes with their peers in the general student body, the drug problem
      was seen to be less for student-athletes, and in some instances, dramatically
      less.

TI  - Racquet sports. The future.
PG  - 277-80
AB  - The future of sports medicine and the affiliated sciences is extremely promising 
      within the world of tennis. Players and coaches have recognized the important
      role of science in supporting tennis training and development. The USTA has
      established the sport sciences as a basis for all programs and policies. The
      challenges for the future appear clear: 1. To promote tennis specific research
      that specifically addresses the training, development, and competitive needs of
      coaches and athletes. 2. To access sport science information generated in other
      countries or by other sports that maybe useful to tennis in the United States. 3.
      To disseminate sport science information in user-friendly language to the widest 
      possible audience. 4. To support all classifications of tennis players with sport
      science information relevant to their group including all ages and skill levels. 
      Much has been accomplished in the past 10 years to support athlete development,
      but the promise of the future is exciting and will require teamwork within the
      tennis and scientific communities by people who love tennis.

TI  - A model of motivational orientation for youth sport: some preliminary work.
PG  - 437-52
AB  - This project was an attempt to test a model of motivational orientation in the
      youth sport setting. Although previous developmental work in this area had
      examined a number of intra- and interpersonal variables thought to influence
      children's motivational orientation, few studies have tested an integrated model.
      Questionnaires assessing perceived competence, perceived control, competitive
      trait anxiety, and motivational orientation were completed by 108 boys.
      Additionally, 12 coaches were observed for two games in order to record coaching 
      behaviors during competition. The model tested demonstrated an excellent fit of
      data. In particular, the model showed that both coaching behaviors and children's
      trait anxiety causally influenced perception of control. Moreover, perceived
      control causally determined both perceived competence and motivational
      orientation. Lastly, the influence of coaching behavior and trait anxiety on
      perceived competence were mediated by perceived control. Implications and
      suggestions for future research are discussed.

TI  - Hypnosis in sport: an Isomorphic Model.
PG  - 963-73
AB  - Hypnosis in sport can be applied according to an Isomorphic Model. Active-alert
      hypnosis is induced before or during practice whereas traditional hypnosis is
      induced after practice to establish connections between the two experiences. The 
      fundamental goals are to (a) develop mental skills important to both motor and
      hypnotic performance, (b) supply a wide range of motor and hypnotic bodily
      experiences important to performance, and (c) induce alert hypnosis before or
      during performance. The model is based on the assumption that hypnosis and motor 
      performance share common skills modifiable through training. Similarities between
      hypnosis and peak performance in the model are also considered. Some predictions 
      are important from theoretical and practical points of view.

      were no age-related differences in perceived competence. The children in the
      younger division endorsed both external perceptions of control and internal
      attributions for success more strongly than the older children did. The younger
      children in each division exhibited significantly more anxiety than their older
      teammates did, although there were no significant across-division effects. All
      the coaches exhibited more instructive behaviors than encouragement, and more
      individual-directed behaviors than team-direction behaviors, but the proportions 
      of both instruction and individual-directed behaviors were relatively higher for 
      the coaches in the older division than they were for the coaches in the younger
      division.

PG  - 135-41
AB  - Athletic departments in colleges and universities are beginning to recognize the 
      role a sports nutrition professional plays in providing both clinical nutrition
      services to athletes and nutrition education programs to teams, coaches, and
      trainers. Traditionally, sports nutritionists have been viewed as capable of
      counseling athletes toward improved nutrition behaviors for improved performance 
      outcomes. More globally, a sports nutritionist at a major university can develop 
      and implement nutrition education programs for athletes that can be implemented
      in alternative situations to effect the greater student body. Menu changes in
      dining facilities, expanded dining hours, and campus workshops on eating
      disorders, weight gain, or weight loss are examples of programs created by a
      university sports nutritionist.

AB  - The use of imagery processes in the regulation and enhancement of sports
      performance is examined in this review paper. Research studies in this area are
      reviewed and four general categories of research are identified: 1) mental
      practice, 2) precompetition imagery, 3) comparisons of successful and
      unsuccessful competitors, and 4) mediating variables. The conclusion is reached
      that mental practice research has produced equivocal results and the reasons for 
      this are examined. The argument is made that the mental practice model for
      research into imagery processes in sports is nonproductive. Suggestions for
      future research directions are offered and guidelines for productive imagery
      research in sport are provided.

AB  - In this article, we have tried to provide a context in which to understand the
      complexities of the psychological experience of being female and being an
      athlete. To this end, we have included general information about the
      socialization process, as well as a more detailed discussion of sports
      socialization and the impact of external influences (such as the media and role
      models) on the activities of young women. Information about the psychological
      characteristics of women athletes was provided as were brief descriptions of a
      number of issues common to the experience of athletes in general and the female
      athlete in particular. This is an exciting time for women in sports; laws are
      changing, opportunities have become available, and women are discovering their
      athletic potential. The women athlete also has choices that were not available to
      previous generations. It is a time of discovery as we learn what the female
      athlete is capable of accomplishing. "We" includes all of us, as coaches,
      parents, friends, the media, treating professionals, fans, and young athletes
      themselves. In some ways, what we learn about women athletes will be similar to
      what is expected in male athletics; however, the female athlete will bring a
      whole new set of attributes and stylistic differences to sport. It will be
      important not to limit her with our expectations; rather, we must encourage her
      to excel to her fullest capabilities.

TI  - A model of stress and burnout in collegiate coaches: effects of gender and time
      of season.
PG  - 48-58
AB  - This investigation examined a model of stress and burnout in male (n = 131) and
      female (n = 118) collegiate head baseball and softball coaches. The model
      hypothesized that personal/situational variables of coaching issues, social
      support, hardiness, gender, and win/loss record predict stress appraisal which,
      in turn, predicts burnout. A preliminary gender by time of season repeated
      measures analysis indicated significant main effects for gender and time. Path
      analyses were conducted to test the model separately for males and females at the
      end of the season only. Results partially supported the model: Both male and
      female coaches higher in coaching issues and lower in hardiness were higher in
      perceived stress, and males lower in social support satisfaction were higher in
      perceived stress. Both male and female coaches' stress appraisal was predictive
      of all burnout components. The coaches were classified as suffering from moderate
      to high levels of emotional exhaustion and low to moderate levels of
      depersonalization and personal accomplishment.

TI  - Precompetition anxiety in women volleyball players: a test of ZOF theory in a
      team sport.
PG  - 47-51
AB  - Consistency in psychological factors is widely regarded to be important for
      successful performance in team sports, but the Zone of Optimal Function (ZOF)
      theory contends that athletes should exhibit considerable variability in the
      level of anxiety that will optimize performance. In an attempt to determine if
      tenets of ZOF theory held for athletes in a team sport, anxiety was measured
      using Spielberger's state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) at the baseline and
      before easy and difficult competitions in nine members of a collegiate women's
      volleyball team. The ability to predict precompetition anxiety was assessed by
      having the athletes complete the STAI both 3 weeks and 2 days before each match
      according to how they thought they would feel 1 h before competition. Each
      athlete also completed the STAI on the basis of how she recalled feeling before
      her best competition. Four anxiety units were added and subtracted from this
      value to establish the ZOF of each player. Actual precompetition anxiety was
      assessed 1 h before each match. In accordance with ZOF theory, considerable
      variability was found in the range of optimal anxiety, and 55.5% of the team
      members reported performing best at either low or high levels of anxiety. The
      prediction of precompetition anxiety made 2 days before competition was
      significantly correlated to actual anxiety for the difficult match (r = 0.69, P <
      0.05) but not the easy match (r = 0.21, P > 0.05). Predictions made 3 weeks
      before competition were not significant (P > 0.05). More (P < 0.05) of the player
      possessed anxiety levels within the ZOF for the difficult match compared with the
      easy match (77.7% versus 22.2%). In summary, athletes in the team sport of
      volleyball exhibit considerable variation in optimal precompetition anxiety in
      accordance with ZOF theory. As posited by ZOF theory, the athletes were able to
      predict anxiety before a difficult match accurately and were more likely to have 
      anxiety levels with ZOF.

TI  - Sports injuries in children.
PG  - 80-4
AB  - More children are participating in organized sports than ever before. Although
      improved coaching, equipment, officiating, and rules have been implemented to
      reduce injuries, a significant number of young athletes continue to be injured.
      Fortunately, most injuries sustained by young athletes are minor requiring only
      symptomatic treatment. However, because of the unique features of the immature
      skeleton, particularly the presence of open physes, these injuries can
      nonetheless result in permanent alteration of bone growth with long-term
      morbidity and disability. Furthermore, the prognosis and natural history of
      sports injuries in children may be different than that for similar injuries in
      adults. It is important that the practitioner dealing with young athletes be
      aware of the unique features of children's sports injuries so that proper
      treatment may be initiated and prognosis and expected outcome may be
      intelligently discussed with the patient and parents. This review provides
      current information regarding sports injuries in children by summarizing the most
      recent pertinent articles.

TI  - [Evaluation of sport injuries in children and adolescents].
PG  - 202-7
AB  - During 1992, 541 sport injuries (6.3% of the 8641 surgical emergencies) were
      recorded at Lenval's hospital pediatric emergency ward in Nice. There were a
      majority of boys (62%), and the mean age was 11.2 years. Thirty one sports were
      represented, mainly soccer (18.5%), bicycle (12.2%), basketball (9.4%),
      gymnastics (9.4%), ski (9.2%) and equitation (7.8%). Injuries occurred during
      competition in 12.7% of the cases, school practice in 36.3%, and free practice in
      51%. Lesions concerned head and face in 15.5% of cases, the trunk in 9.2%, and
      limbs in 75.3% with a majority of twists and benign contusions. The
      hospitalisation's rate was 14.4%, and a surgical intervention with anesthesia was
      performed in 7.6% of cases to treat one shoulder dislocation and 42 limb
      fractures. Thirty percent of children were confirmed sportsmen/women, 40% of them
      were involved in competitive sports, the most frequently concerned sports being
      soccer (24.6%), basketball (18%), fighting sports (11.4%; 7.2% = judo), gymnastic
      (10.1%), tennis (7.9%) and equitation (6.7%). From this study most sports
      injuries in children appears benign even if some fractures led to hospitalisation
      and orthopedic surgery; this is possibly related to the quality of education and 
      coaching, particularly during physical training at school.

TI  - The learning of motor skills: sports science and ergonomics perspectives.
PG  - 5-16
AB  - The paper describes some of the common origins of ergonomics and sports science
      in the UK with particular reference to research on motor learning. Attention is
      drawn to the value of analytical methods developed by ergonomists in deriving
      training prescriptions and their relationship with conventional learning theory
      is discussed. The cognitive revolution, which in the last 25 years has changed
      the face of psychology, has also had its impact on ergonomics and basic research 
      on motor skills. The role of cognitive processes in motor learning is being
      reassessed and there is a renewed interest in topics such as verbal instruction, 
      imitation, imagery, and mental practice which to earlier generations of
      behavioural scientists appeared beyond the scope of scientific investigation. The
      paper outlines some recent research into the role of imagery in motor learning
      illustrating these new approaches.

TI  - Predictors of attainment in rhythmic sportive gymnastics.
PG  - 367-77
AB  - Correlates of attainment in rhythmic sportive gymnastics (RSG) were investigated 
      in a cross-sectional study of 106 female gymnasts aged 7-27 years. Physical
      attributes were obtained by anthropometry and from tests of flexibility, leg
      power, maximum oxygen uptake and visuo-motor proficiency. Training and
      psychological measures were derived from self-administered questionnaires that
      included the Leadership Scale for Sport, Psychological Skills Inventory for
      Sport, General Health Questionnaire, Sport Competition Anxiety Test, and several 
      questions on sport motivation and enjoyment. Attainment was expressed as
      competition grade level and mean performance score in 4 competitions. The best
      correlates of attainment were cumulative and current training time (r =
      0.84-0.53). Age, lean body mass and composite measures of flexibility, leg power 
      and visuo-motor proficiency were also significant correlates of attainment (r =
      0.69-0.29), as were coach democratic and coach social behaviours (r = 0.41-0.28).
      The significant positive psychometric correlates of attainment were mental
      preparation, motivation by creativity, and several dimensions of enjoyment (r =
      0.35-0.26); significant negative correlates were recent anxiety-depression and
      enjoyment of training (r = -0.34-(-)0.32). No previous study has identified the
      relative contributions of such a comprehensive range of physical, psychological
      and training measures to performance of a sport.

TI  - Enhancement of children's self-esteem through social support training for youth
      sport coaches.
PG  - 602-10
AB  - The authors examined the impact of coaching behaviors on players'
      self-enhancement processes. Eight baseball coaches attended a preseason workshop 
      designed to increase their supportiveness and instructional effectiveness.
      Behavioral guidelines were presented and modeled. A no-treatment control group
      had 10 coaches. Boys (N = 152) in both groups were interviewed pre- and
      postseason. Trained coaches differed from controls in player-perceived behaviors 
      in accordance with the guidelines. They were evaluated more positively by their
      players, their players had more fun, and their teams exhibited a higher level of 
      attraction among players, despite the fact that their teams did not differ from
      controls in won-lost records. Consistent with a self-esteem enhancement model,
      findings showed that boys with low self-esteem who played for the trained coaches
      exhibited significant increases in general self-esteem; low self-esteem
      youngsters in the control group did not.

PG  - 158-66
AB  - The purpose of this study was to gauge the extent to which students believed that
      the accountability strategies employed by their coaches had significant effects
      on their involvement in sports training sessions. Questionnaire data from 235
      secondary school athletes were analyzed using linear structural relations to test
      a model of accountability hypothesized as operating in these coaching settings.
      The accountability strategy of active instruction was found to be a variable that
      significantly affected the students' valuing of their coaches as well as their
      task involvement. However, the rewards/consequences variable was not found to be 
      a predictor of valuing or task involvement, suggesting that these athletes seemed
      more task oriented than reliant on external sanctions. The results of this study 
      can only be generalized to team sport settings. Detailed examination needs to be 
      made of the processes through which accountability factors operate for other
      contexts, including individual sports and competitive levels. Further research
      could also be undertaken into gender differences, especially in relation to the
      gender of coaches.

TI  - Participation in community sports centres: motives and predictors of enjoyment.
PG  - 249-56
AB  - Research into why people engage in sport and physical recreation has received
      relatively little attention in both recreation planning and sport psychology.
      Although there has been a steady flow of North American literature related to
      participation motivation in competitive youth sport settings, such evidence is of
      limited value in explaining adult involvement in sport and recreation in Britain.
      The purpose of this exploratory study was to determine why people participate in 
      sport and exercise in community sports centres and to identify whether these
      motives predict sport enjoyment. The study was based on a questionnaire-interview
      of approximately 5 min duration conducted in six community sports centres in
      Leicester. The sample comprised 336 respondents aged 16 years and over. The
      subjects were presented with 15 motives for sports participation and indicated
      their degree of agreement on a 5-point scale. The three most commonly endorsed
      motives were to maintain health, develop physical fitness and aid relaxation. A
      factor analysis with oblique rotation revealed four factors:assertive
      achievement, physical well-being, socio-psychological well-being, and sports
      mastery and performance. Discriminant analysis showed that males were more
      motivated to participate for sports mastery and performance and assertive
      achievement than females. A MANOVA showed that older subjects were more motivated
      by socio-psychological well-being than younger subjects. Sport enjoyment was best
      predicted by socio-psychological well-being, sports mastery and performance, and 
      sports importance, although only 14.4% of the variance in enjoyment scores was
      accounted for. These results confirm other research on age differences in
      exercise and mental health, as well as gender differences on participation
      motives.

TI  - Cardiovascular activity during mental stress following vigorous exercise in
      sportsmen and inactive men.
PG  - 245-52
AB  - Thirty-six competitive sportsmen and 36 inactive men participated in a
      two-session experiment. Session 1 involved exercise to exhaustion so as to assess
      maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max). In Session 2, both groups were randomized
      into three experimental conditions: 20 min of exercise at high intensity (70%
      VO2max) or moderate intensity (50% VO2max) or a light exercise control. Following
      30 min of recovery, all subjects performed mental arithmetic and public speech
      tasks in a counterbalanced order. Cardiovascular, electrodermal, respiratory, and
      subjective variables were recorded. Sportsmen had higher VO2max, lower body fat, 
      and lower resting heart rate (HR) than inactive men. A postexercise hypotensive
      response was observed among subjects in the 70% and 50% VO2max conditions,
      accompanied by baroreceptor reflex inhibition in the 70% condition. Systolic
      pressure was lower during mental arithmetic and during recovery from the speech
      task in the high-intensity than in the control group. Diastolic pressure was
      lower following mental arithmetic in the high-intensity group. No differences in 
      HR reactivity, electrodermal, or respiratory parameters were observed, but
      baroreceptor reflex sensitivity was inhibited during mental arithmetic. The
      results are discussed in relation to previous reports of suppressed
      cardiovascular reactivity to mental stress tests following vigorous exercise and 
      the role of stress-related processes in the antihypertensive response to physical
      training.

AB  - The theme of the article is ethical problems and dilemmas in sports medicine. Our
      practice should be guided by medical norms and rules and the fair play-norm of
      sport. International and national examples are presented and used to elucidate
      some dilemmas. A special problem for the doctor may be loyalty to the team and to
      the coach. Use of drugs can be a temptation for doctor as well as for athlete.
      Misuse of athletes as experimental subjects has been a problem in some countries.

TI  - An examination of personal/situational variables, stress appraisal, and burnout
      in collegiate teacher-coaches.
PG  - 94-102
AB  - Following Smith's (1986) cognitive-affective model of stress and burnout in
      athletics, this investigation examined (a) the relationship of
      personal/situational variables (social support, gender, and years of experience) 
      to stress appraisal and (b) the relationship of stress appraisal (perceived
      stress, coaching issues, and role conflict) to burnout. Male (n = 99) and female 
      (n = 115) teacher-head basketball coaches from NCAA Division III and NAIA
      colleges completed established measures of burnout, perceived stress,
      teacher-coach role conflict, and social support and a measure of coaching issues 
      developed for this study. Multivariate analyses supported the hypothesized
      relationships. Specifically, greater satisfaction with social support, less
      experience, and gender (females higher) were related to stress appraisal, and all
      stress appraisal variables were positively related to burnout. Contrary to
      previous studies, these teacher-coaches reported moderate to high levels of
      burnout.

TI  - Effects of contextual interference on learning technical sports skills.
PG  - 555-62
AB  - The effects of contextual interference on learning skills of volleyball (volley, 
      bump, serve) are influenced by the scheduling of actual practice sessions: the
      activities can be proposed in a repetitive practice schedule (blocked practice)
      by continuously repeating the same task (low interference) or in random practice 
      schedules by performing more tasks or variations of one same activity (high
      interference). High contextual interference, even though causing immediate
      limited performance, leads to superior performance on retention and transfer
      tests. Four experimental groups (13 students each) were placed in conditions of
      random, blocked, serial, and serial with high interference practice for 8
      meetings (2 tests and 6 practice). Analysis yielded significant differences among
      the groups on a transfer test (long transfer) for the serve, so results in this
      instructional setting are partially in line with those generally found in
      laboratory experiments.

PG  - 198-201
AB  - A six-months sports programme had been implemented to analyze the impact of
      movement, play and sports on the physical situation of persons having rheumatism,
      their mental well-being and attitudes towards sporting activities. 41 patients
      participated in the programme, attending training sessions in a fitness studio
      once a week. The sports programme contained general endurance training,
      functional and strengthening exercises, elements of gymnastics and play, as well 
      as relaxation techniques. The following assessment tools were used: Measurement
      of Patient Outcome (MOPO) scales, sports questionnaire, and the STEP test. It was
      found that participants' health status, both physical and mental, had been
      influenced in a positive manner, with proof being provided of reduced levels of
      anxiety, depression, and pain. Moreover, attitudinal changes toward sports appear
      to have resulted, suggesting persistent motivation to engage in sporting
      activity.

TI  - Eye injuries in Canadian sports and recreational activities.
PG  - 226-9
AB  - Over 4000 eye injuries, including 449 blind eyes, have been reported in sports
      and recreational activities in Canada over the past 20 years. This is not only a 
      great personal loss but also a financial loss, both to the injured person and to 
      the community. Statistics should be tabulated on catastrophic injuries that leave
      the person with a physical or mental deficit, such as a blind eye, and efforts
      should be directed toward preventing such injuries. Changing and enforcing game
      rules and providing proper eye protection has proved very beneficial in Canadian 
      hockey, racket sports and war games. Educational programs supported by the media 
      and government that alert players to the need for eye protection are required.
      Such measures may lead to the prevention of up to 90% of injuries in sports and
      recreational activities in Canada.

TI  - Psychological stress, performance, and injury in sport.
PG  - 615-29
AB  - This paper reviews the empirical literature on psychological stress in sport, and
      the effects that such stress may have upon performance, vulnerability to injury, 
      and rehabilitation from injury. It also examines the strategies that sports
      performers could use to overcome these effects. The major sources of stress that 
      have been reported by sports performers include fear of failure, concerns about
      social evaluation by others (particularly the coach), lack of readiness to
      perform, and loss of internal control over one's environment. Various models and 
      theories of the effects of such stress upon performance and vulnerability to
      injury are reviewed, including multidimensional anxiety theory and a catastrophe 
      model of anxiety and performance. The cognitive and physiological processes which
      are thought to underly these effects are also reviewed, together with the
      intervention strategies that are implied by these processes. Research on the
      psychological stress that appears to be experienced by performers when they are
      injured is very limited. However, that which is available suggests that many of
      the same psychological skills that are thought to enhance performance can also be
      used to reduce the risk of injury, and promote a speedy recovery from injury.
      These include goal-setting, imagery, self-talk, and relaxation skills.

TI  - Predicting outcomes: Sports and stocks.
PG  - 201-22
LID - 10.1007/BF01014636 [doi]
AB  - Many gamblers and most fans, players, and coaches offer causal explanations for
      long runs of good or bad performance in sports and financial analysts are quick
      to offer explanations for the daily performance of the stock market. The records 
      of professional basketball and baseball teams and the Dow Jones daily closing
      average for a ten year period were evaluated for trends (streaks). The records of
      teams were also evaluated to assess whether the record against opponents, the
      home court or home field advantage, and-for baseball teams-the record of the
      winning and losing pitcher (excluding the current game) predicted the outcome of 
      individual games. Recent performance is, at best, a very weak predictor of
      current performance and the three best predictors for baseball (pitching, home
      field, and record against opponent) together accounted for only 1.7% of the
      variance in the outcomes of individual games. We overestimate our ability to
      predict. This overconfidence is likely to play a role in maintaining gambling
      behaviors.

TI  - Are casein kinases the assistant coaches for DNA metabolism?
PG  - 153-5
AB  - A cell can be thought of as a well-coached sports team. To win, it needs
      superstar players with specialized tasks, but it also needs team players who can 
      be relied on to maintain constant performance. Growth factor receptors or
      transcriptional activators might be considered to be the cell's superstars,
      whereas ribosomes could be considered team players that faithfully carry out
      directions from mRNA. The team also needs a head coach for overall direction and 
      assistant coaches to direct the basic skills. The assistant coaches should ensure
      that basic cellular functions proceed correctly and that the cell responds to
      specific stimuli. Since almost every phosphorylatable protein is modified by
      several protein kinases, protein kinases like casein kinases I and II might be
      the assistant coaches of cellular regulation.

TI  - An overview of sport psychiatry.
PG  - 606-14
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although the application of psychiatric methods and principles to
      sports is relatively unsystematic at this time, athletic behavior presents
      several issues of interest to psychiatry. The aim of this paper is to provide a
      framework for understanding the developmental, occupational, pathologic,
      therapeutic, and research aspects of sport psychiatry. METHOD: Studies in
      psychiatry, psychology, and psychoanalysis provide the basis for this overview,
      and nonscientific works are cited where they illuminate various issues.
      Illustrative case examples are also reported. RESULTS: It is proposed, but not
      proven, that athletes undergo phase-specific development and that they may suffer
      impairments in adapting to the athletic context. This context may also modify
      treatment modalities. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for more clinical studies of
      athletes, especially in the realms of childhood traumas, competitive issues, and 
      mental illnesses. Because of the close relationship of mental and physical
      phenomena in sports and because athletic behaviors are often precisely
      measurable, athletics may constitute a fruitful area for psychiatric research.

TI  - Coaches. A missing link in the health care system.
PG  - 211-7
AB  - The number of children and adolescents who participate in interscholastic
      athletics demands attention to the quality of the coaching they receive and to
      the opportunities that the athlete-coach relationship provides for modification
      of high-risk behaviors, social skills training, and character formation. Although
      the need for coaches has increased due to the advent of girls' athletic programs,
      which was mandated by Title IX legislation, only a minority of states require
      certification for coaches who work in school systems. Four coaching curricula are
      summarized and contrasted: the American Coaching Effectiveness Program, the
      curriculum of the National Youth Sports Coaches Association, the Athletic Health 
      Care System, and the Coach Effectiveness Training Program. Recommendations for
      coach certification by states, physician advocacy for coaching standards, and
      improved sports medicine services are discussed.

TI  - Eating disorders among adolescent female athletes: influence of athletic
      participation and sport team membership.
PG  - 833-48
AB  - Female athletes have been identified as a potential risk group for the
      development of eating disorders. Although adolescents in general are particularly
      vulnerable to the onset of eating disorders, little research has examined the
      problem among high school female athletes. The present study explored this
      population by comparing female athletes and nonathletes in terms of (a)
      behavioral and psychological traits associated with eating disorders and (b) use 
      of pathogenic weight control techniques (laxatives, vomiting, fasting, and diet
      aids). Sport-by-sport comparisons were also investigated to determine if athletes
      in specific sports were more at risk. Moreover, in an attempt to link athletic
      participation and eating disordered behavior, the gender-role orientation of
      athletes was examined. Results indicated that (a) athletes were more likely than 
      nonathletes to possess certain behavioral and psychological correlates of eating 
      disorders, (b) there were few differences among the various sport teams, and (c) 
      gender-role orientation was generally not a critical variable. Although group
      comparisons yielded limited significant differences, athletes nevertheless
      reported traits associated with eating disorders as well as use of pathogenic
      weight control techniques. The unique contributions of the sport context and
      coaching practices exacerbating disordered eating are discussed.

TI  - Concussion in sports. Guidelines for the prevention of catastrophic outcome.
PG  - 2867-9
AB  - Concussion (defined as a traumatically induced alteration in mental status, not
      necessarily with loss of consciousness) is a common form of sports-related injury
      too often dismissed as trivial by physicians, athletic trainers, coaches, sports 
      reporters, and athletes themselves. While head injuries can occur in virtually
      any form of athletic activity, they occur most frequently in contact sports, such
      as football, boxing, and martial arts competition, or from high-velocity
      collisions or falls in basketball, soccer, and ice hockey. The pathophysiology of
      concussion is less well understood than that of severe head injury, and it has
      received less attention as a result. We describe a high school football player
      who died of diffuse brain swelling after repeated concussions without loss of
      consciousness. Guidelines have been developed to reduce the risk of such serious 
      catastrophic outcomes after concussion in sports.

TI  - Sports medicine in Hawaii: care of the high school athlete in Oahu's public
      schools.
PG  - 395-6
AB  - A recent study by the National Athletic Trainers Association indicated that
      injuries occur more often during practice than during games in high school
      athletics. Results of the 3-year study indicated that 60% of basketball injuries 
      occurred in boys and young men during practice and 59% occurred in women. About
      2/3 of the estimated 120,000 injuries suffered by prep wrestlers each year happen
      during practice. The study found that an average of 331,865 high school football 
      players (1/3 of the million who play football each year) were sidelined by an
      injury at least once. With these statistics in mind, our study looks at the
      approach to the management of injury in the public schools that make up the Oahu 
      Inter-scholastic Association (OIA) in the state of Hawaii. The estimated number
      of student athletes that participate in organized athletics in the OIA is 7,960
      and the number of coaches is 1,189.

TI  - Relationship between mental imagery and sporting performance.
PG  - 29-36
AB  - Simultaneous measurement of six autonomic nervous system (ANS) variable responses
      during mental rehearsal of an action, makes it possible to draw a parallel
      between mental imagery of a task and its actual execution. The experiment was
      carried out in the field during precision shooting competitions and in the
      laboratory for imagery activity, on 22 subjects. Results show that there is
      similarity of ANS response in the three situations: the period of concentration
      prior to shooting, actual shooting and mental representation of shooting. The
      ratio formed by ANS response during concentration and imagery of actual firing
      tends towards the value one, therefore towards some identity. All subjects may be
      classified around this value; it is worth noting that subject distribution around
      this value corresponds to performance value. It seems that the better the
      subject, the closer his concentration/shooting or imagery/actual shooting ratio
      is to the theoretical value one. These results show the utmost importance of the 
      quality of mental representation for performance improvement. It can be supposed 
      that subject classification above the theoretical value one corresponds to
      overflowing emotional reactivity in one of the two phases and that this
      interferes with accuracy; a placing below the theoretical value one shows a lack 
      of similarity between mental representation and the action.

AB  - The present research was designed to investigate the concept of familiarity and
      how different kinds of familiarity could affect the coding and memory of places
      having specific and strong functional significance, i.e., sport courts. Tennis
      and basketball were selected. Users and nonusers of such sport courts had first
      to describe a sport court taking the necessary information from their stored
      schematic knowledge and then to describe a sport court previously seen in a
      photograph. Subjects' verbal reports showed a certain superiority of users'
      performance, a commonly found place effect, and the presence of errors only on
      the second task and mainly by the users group. The results are discussed in terms
      of the environmental schemata theory and of the different kinds of familiarity
      considered.

TI  - Epidemiology and prediction of sports-related traumatic injuries.
PG  - 609-26
AB  - All sports injuries, and this is certainly true of dentally related sports
      injuries, occur for predictable reasons. In some instances, these predictors have
      been well studied and are recognized by participants as well as coaches,
      dentists, and other responsible parties. In other instances, there is much to be 
      learned about these predictors. There is no question that predictors have direct 
      influence upon the incidence and prevalence data for dental injuries related to
      each sport. Because of the variability of these predictors from one sport to
      another, from one sports participant to another, from one age group to another,
      and even from on playground, field, or court to another, the importance and
      validity and usefulness of much of the data available currently is debatable. The
      importance of sports dentistry is not based solely on the urgency afforded by a
      given number of injuries among a specified number of participants over a certain 
      amount of time. It is the predictable nature of these injuries and the need for
      the profession to take responsible action in their prevention and treatment that 
      provides the strongest imperative for a sports dentistry movement.

TI  - Quantification of training in competitive sports. Methods and applications.
PG  - 161-83
AB  - The training of competitive athletes can be assessed by retrospective
      questionnaires, diaries, physiological monitoring and direct observation of
      training behaviour. Questionnaires represent the most economical, most
      comprehensive and least accurate method. Diaries are more valid, but their
      drawbacks for long term quantitative studies are poor compliance and difficulties
      in processing the data they generate. Physiological monitoring (of oxygen
      consumption, heart rate or blood lactate concentration) provides objective
      measures of training intensity, and direct observation gives valid measures of
      most aspects of training; however, these methods are impractical for continuous, 
      long term use. Coaches and athletes quantify training for purposes of motivation,
      systematisation of training and training prescription, but there has been little 
      study of the use of training quantification by these practitioners. Motivation
      and systematisation are probably achieved best with diaries. Direct observation
      appears to be the best method of ensuring compliance with a training
      prescription, although heart rate monitoring is also a promising method for
      prescribing endurance training intensity. Sport scientists quantify training to
      study its effects on the performance and health status of competitive athletes.
      Most studies have been descriptive rather than experimental, and unvalidated
      questionnaires have been the predominant method of assaying training. The main
      areas of research include performance prediction and enhancement, overtraining,
      reproductive dysfunction, injury, illness, and nutritional status. Training has
      substantial effects in all of these areas. There is a need for more experimental 
      studies that utilise validated measures of training to investigate how to reduce 
      sports injuries and enhance competitive sports performance. More attention could 
      also be given to methodological issues of training quantification.

TI  - Sports injuries in the female athlete.
PG  - 643-5
AB  - Women are successfully participating in a variety of sports in increasing
      numbers, both recreationally and competitively. There are certain anatomic and
      physiologic differences between men and women that make each sex unique, but
      there also are multiple external factors that significantly influence athletic
      performance. The nature of injuries seems to be more sports-specific than
      gender-specific. Even the increased susceptibility to overuse syndromes found in 
      women may be reduced by increasing awareness and redefining conditioning and
      coaching techniques. Further epidemiologic studies of women's athletic injuries
      will be needed to better define injury patterns and to suggest preventive
      measures.

TI  - Coach/player relationships in tennis.
PG  - 229-33
AB  - The present study examined the variables that predict coach/athlete
      compatibility. Compatibility among a sample of 52 elite tennis coach/player dyads
      was assessed using a sport adapted version of Schutz's (1966) Fundamental
      Interpersonal Relations Orientation-Behaviour (FIRO-B), a sport adapted version
      of Fiedler's (1967) Least Preferred Co-worker scale (LPC), and Chelladurai and
      Saleh's (1980) Leadership Scale for Sport (LSS). Self-ratings of the quality of
      the interaction were obtained from both coach and athlete. Multiple-regression
      analyses using self-rating scores as the dependent measure were carried out to
      determine which variables best predicted the degree of compatibility. The sole
      inventory that significantly predicted compatibility was the LSS. More
      specifically, the discrepancy between the athlete's preferences and perceptions
      on the autocratic dimension was the best predictor. Implications for tennis
      coaches and recommendations for future research in this area are discussed.

TI  - Determination of player potential in volleyball: coaches' rating versus game
      performance.
PG  - 161-4
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine if the factors which coaches feel
      indicated superior player potential were the same as those factors which
      contribute to successful competition outcome. Players from two colleges were
      evaluated for general and specific performance variables prior to a regular
      season match between the teams. A player's ability rating was the total of four
      coaches' ranking on a 1-to-10 scale. Multiple regression analysis to predict
      player ability rating selected age, vertical jump, total body movement time, and 
      agility (R = 0.87). However, step-wise discriminant analysis to differentiate
      winning and losing team members selected shoulder flexibility, agility, forearm
      bump, and sit-and-reach flexibility. The canonical correlation between the
      winning-losing dichotomy and these skills was 0.74 and resulted in proper
      classification of 84.6% of the correct team members. It was concluded that the
      skills coaches consider indicative of superior ability are not necessarily the
      factors which dictate winning performance.

TI  - [The effectiveness of interaction of volunteer coaches in training].
PG  - 134-41
AB  - This study describes teaching and learning processes during a series of soccer
      training sessions. The predetermined course content formed the initial practicum 
      for volunteer coaches who were in the first stage of their training. In general, 
      the players demonstrated patterns of motor behaviour favourable to their motor
      learning. The coaches adopted most of the effective behaviors that had been
      recommended during the theoretical portion of their preparation. These
      observations tend to indicate the usefulness of having volunteer coaches
      participate in a practicum as part of their preparation, in order to improve the 
      effectiveness of their subsequent instruction. Such instruction is likely to be
      even more effective if the practicum is based on training sessions of
      predetermined content.

TI  - Nutrition training, attitudes, knowledge, recommendations, responsibility, and
      resource utilization of high school coaches and trainers.
PG  - 321-4
AB  - Because misconceptions about nutrition are prevalent in athletics, we assessed
      the knowledge of sports-related nutrition concepts of high school athletic
      personnel. A questionnaire was mailed to all athletic directors and teacher
      athletic trainers in North Carolina high schools. Of the 821 surveys sent, 303
      were returned (a response rate of 37%). The sample was grouped into three
      categories on the basis of the perceived role of the respondent: coach (n = 152),
      trainer (n = 91), and dual coach-trainer (n = 29). Thirty-one individuals who
      indicated that they held administrative positions with little or no contact with 
      students were omitted from the analysis. One-way analysis of variance or chi 2
      was used to examine differences in questionnaire responses among the three
      groups. In comparison with high school coaches, trainers had taken more workshops
      or courses related to nutrition (2.9 compared with 1.8) and had more frequently
      used professional meetings (62% vs 39%), workshops (64% vs 41%), and textbooks
      (75% vs 50%) as sources of information. Trainers were more knowledgeable about
      nutrition (9.6 correct responses vs 8.9 for coaches) and recommended desirable
      nutrition practices more often than coaches (7 of 9 vs 6 of 9). There was some
      disagreement between coaches and trainers in their perceptions of who was more
      important in dispensing nutrition information. Future nutrition education efforts
      should take into account the differences among these groups.

AB  - This chapter discusses the epidemiology of injuries in organized sports in
      adolescents from junior high school through college age. Epidemiology includes
      the study of the distribution, causes, and prevention of disease. Epidemiologic
      data on sports injuries can help pediatricians to counsel families about the
      risks of specific sports, to know what injuries to expect in a given activity, to
      help athletic programs plan for medical care, and to advise athletes and coaches 
      on injury prevention.

PG  - 587-608
AB  - The evaluation of the multi-sectoral collaborative school mental health program
      conducted in Alexandria from 1987 to 1990 has to be done along various dimensions
      (Seif El-Din et al.). The aim of the present work is to investigate the trend
      change in utilization of the psychiatric clinic in the Students' Hospital
      (Sporting) through comparing pre-program years (1983/84-1987/88) trend with
      program years (1988/89-90/91) trend. The source of information about clinic
      utilization consisted of two registers; one for new cases and the other for
      return visits. The utilization trend of the psychiatric clinic for return visits 
      showed an increased rate of referral through program years as compared to
      pre-program trend expected rates. Similarly, new visits trend of referral showed 
      the same picture except for nocturnal enuresis. These findings lend further
      support for the positive impact of the previously mentioned program on the
      knowledge and detection skills of school physicians. Meanwhile, they highlight
      the need for further concern regarding their skills in management of mental
      disorders.

TI  - Recent developments in drug abuse and doping control in sport.
PG  - S2-6
AB  - Since September 1988 when Ben Johnson was tested positive for a banned substance 
      at the Seoul Olympic Games, many national and international initiatives have been
      taken to improve the control of doping in sport. This paper summarizes the
      revised provisions of the International Olympic Committee list of doping classes 
      and methods. Recent events are also reviewed, including the investigation into
      the use of performance-enhancing drugs by Australian sportsmen and women (the
      Black Enquiry), by the Canadians (the Dubin Enquiry) and by the British (the Coni
      Enquiry and the Jacobs Enquiry). Recent political initiatives are considered, in 
      particular the major international agreements such as the Soviet-American Joint
      Commission, the International Olympic Antidoping Charter and the European
      Anti-Doping Convention. Sportsmen and women who, in the past, have been tested
      positive for banned substances have been the focus of much attention from the
      sporting community, the general public and the media, but others including
      coaches, physicians, scientists and others, must share the blame for the spread
      of drug abuse in sport. In the UK the new policies and programmes of the Sports
      Council (and the Sports Councils in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland) should 
      provide a better programme for doping control than that previously used, and the 
      new international agreements should provide a better framework for international 
      cooperation on education, detection and research.

TI  - [The impact of psychological stress on somatic and biochemical parameters in an
      atypical sports discipline].
PG  - 479-85
AB  - The subject of our interest was to investigate the response of the organism to
      mental strain in an atypical sports discipline. To this end we examined 10 chess 
      players. We assessed their pulse rate at rest, before a contest, immediately
      after the contest and after 5 mins. recovery. Statistical evaluation revealed an 
      increased heart rate before the contest, as compared with rest at a level of
      significance of 0.01; after the contest as compared with the status before the
      contest at a level of 0.02; in the recovery stage, as compared with rest, at the 
      0.01 level. As a control group we examined 10 hockey players under the same
      conditions and the results were compared with the chess players. For scientific
      practice it is necessary to find a way to monitor the internal environment during
      a chess game (catecholamines, lactate, glucose, fatty acids, cholesterol and
      others). As soon as this will be possible without disturbing the reflection
      process of the chess player, we shall be able to obtain more information on the
      adaptation of the organism to mental strain during a game of chess.

TI  - Expert assessment of the national coaching certification program (NCCP) theory
      component.
PG  - 201-12
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine if the educational objectives of the
      revised national coaching certification theory program (NCCP) represent the
      important and necessary skills needed to be an effective coach in both
      contemporary and future Canadian society. A study sample of experts in coach
      education in Canada (n = 75) agreed to participate in the investigation which was
      based on a research protocol known as the Delphi technique. Results of the study 
      indicate that coach education experts in Canada generally agreed with the
      educational objectives at each level of the program in both the present and the
      futures data. Further, the experts seemed to favour a socio-psychological
      orientation to the curriculum content at level 1 and level 2 and a balance
      between the biophysical and the socio-psychological sports science areas at level
      3.

PG  - 259-67
AB  - Previous research indicates that young athletes as well as athletic
      administrators hold gender-role stereotypical beliefs about coaches that disfavor
      females. The validity of two such beliefs (lack of qualified female coaches and
      time constraints due to family responsibilities) was examined in a statewide
      survey of 256 female and 296 male interscholastic coaches and a nationwide survey
      of 2,719 male and 1,449 female interscholastic coaches. Statistical analyses (p
      less than .001) indicated that female coaches were (a) more qualified than their 
      male counterparts with respect to coaching experience with female teams,
      professional training, and professional experience; (b) as qualified as male
      coaches with regard to intercollegiate playing experience; and (c) less qualified
      than male coaches with respect to high school playing experience and coaching
      experience with male teams. Findings also indicated that male rather than female 
      coaches more often experienced time constraints due to family responsibilities.

TI  - Epilepsy and sports.
PG  - 9-19
AB  - Millions of healthy people participate in sport on a regular basis. Moreover, in 
      the last decade patients with chronic disorders have been encouraged to take part
      in sporting activities as a part of their rehabilitation. Can epileptic patients 
      freely participate in sport or whether they are restricted to a certain extent by
      their disorder? An important factor is freedom from seizures. If seizures have
      been controlled for over 2 years the risk of relapse is the same as the risk of a
      first seizure. The risk of patients drowning or falling, or their epilepsy
      worsening because they are engaged in sport is thought to be low. Clinical data
      suggest that the incidence of seizures during sports and exercise is reduced. In 
      the cooling down period, however, seizures tend to occur more frequently.
      Physicians should encourage epileptic patients to participate in sporting
      activities to enhance their physical fitness, self-esteem, and social
      integration. Before giving advice about the most suitable type of sport, the
      physician should known the patient's medical history, have a good insight into
      the different types of sport and be able to judge the role and function of sport 
      to the particular patient. With certain precautions virtually all sports are
      suitable for most epileptic patients and should therefore be encouraged. However,
      a small minority of hospitalised patients with severe epilepsy need the
      supervision of qualified trainers, coaches and volunteers.

TI  - Psychological risk factors and sports injuries.
PG  - 202-21
AB  - Injuries sustained during competitive sport activities are accepted as an
      inherent part of the game. While it may be true that the associated risk of
      participating in certain sports increases the chance of becoming hurt, it is safe
      to assume many injuries can be avoided if preventive medicine is practiced.
      Conditioning and strength training go a long way in protecting the athlete from
      possible harm, but in some cases this is not enough. The accumulated effect of
      psychological stressors (in and outside the athletic world) may cloud the mental 
      functioning of the athlete and override physical conditioning enough to
      precipitate injury or prolong it. After extensive reviews of literature, it has
      been determined that a collective researched list of psychological risk factors
      can be recognized which may predispose an athlete (especially in a contact sport)
      to injury (real or imagined).

TI  - Nutrition knowledge and dietary practices of college coaches.
PG  - 705-9
AB  - The objectives of this study were to measure nutrition knowledge of college
      coaches, to identify educational and demographic factors that affect nutrition
      knowledge of college coaches, to describe dietary practices recommended by these 
      coaches, and to identify major sources of nutrition information used by coaches. 
      Questionnaires were mailed to 296 coaches of senior and junior colleges in North 
      Carolina using a listing from the National Directory of College Athletics.
      Coaches of the following sports were included: track and field, cross country,
      swimming, tennis, basketball, gymnastics, golf, football, and wrestling. The
      response rate was 36%. Seventy percent of the 15 nutrition knowledge test items
      were answered correctly; however, only one-third of the coaches indicated a high 
      degree of certainty for the correctness of their responses. There were no
      significant relationships between nutrition knowledge and sex, age, collegiate
      conference, course work in nutrition, win/loss record, and years of coaching
      experience. Major dietary problems of college athletes reported by coaches were
      consumption of "junk food," poor eating habits, and consumption of an unbalanced 
      diet. The authors recommend an annual workshop for coaches, trainers, and
      dietitians to develop criteria for nutrition assessment and body composition for 
      college athletes and to develop training diets. Special workshops for foodservice
      personnel are also recommended.

TI  - Sport accidents in childhood.
PG  - 40-4
AB  - Injuries among children during sporting activities are common. This study is a
      one year study including children between five and fourteen years of age who
      sustained their injuries during sporting activities and were treated at Trondheim
      Regional and University Hospital. Sport accidents account for 27 per cent of all 
      childhood accidents in this age group. Fifty-three per cent of the injured were
      boys, and 47 per cent were girls. The boys sustained more severe injuries than
      the girls. Soccer caused the greatest number of injuries. Horse riding and alpine
      skiing were the cause of the most severe injuries. A more widespread use of
      protective guards, better technique and body control, better coaching and not
      allowing the younger children to take part in technically advanced sporting
      activities might reduce the number and the severity of the sport injuries in
      children.

TI  - Facial and verbal congruency: effects on perceived verbal and emotional coaching 
      feedback.
PG  - 17-22
AB  - The present study investigated the effects of facial-verbal expression
      congruencies on the perception of a coach's verbal and emotional feedback. The
      design was a two (facial congruency) by two (verbal feedback) completely
      randomized factorial. The facial expression was either congruent or incongruent
      with verbal feedback. Seventy-one university students (39 males, 32 females) were
      randomly assigned to one of the four experimental conditions. Each student
      watched a videotape of facial-verbal pairings and evaluated (a) the percentage of
      positive and negative statements, (b) the emotions expressed by the coach. The
      analysis indicated that incongruent facial expressions distorted, in a negative
      direction, the expected frequency of positive feedback. The emotional state
      findings illustrated that the presence of any negative stimuli (face or verbal)
      produced the perception of negative affect. The findings provided converging
      evidence that inconsistencies in facial-verbal expression have a powerful effect 
      on the perception of verbal feedback and emotional state.

TI  - Young children in recreational sports. Participation motivation.
PG  - 89-94
AB  - More than 20 million children between ages 6 and 16 years participate in
      nonschool sports programs, with increasingly more programs being established for 
      younger-age children. A questionnaire based on previous research with adolescent 
      athletes was developed to determine participation motivation of 6- to 10-year-old
      children. Three hundred fourteen boys participating in a basketball program were 
      interviewed privately with this instrument. Of the 12 participation motivation
      items, "learn to do my best," "learn and improve skills," "have a coach to look
      up to," and "get stronger and healthier" were most highly rated, whereas "win
      games" and "become popular" were rated least important. When responses of 6 and 7
      year olds were compared with those of 9 and 10 year olds, older children rated
      "feel part of a team", "have fun and excitement" and "be with and make new
      friends" higher at a statistically significant level (p less than 0.05). Older
      children rated "win games" and "become popular" lower at a statistically
      significant level (p less than 0.05). The authors conclude that young children in
      this recreational sports program make significant distinctions in their
      participation motivation and that some aspects of participation that motivate
      them change as they grow older.

TI  - Wheelchair racing sports science: a review.
PG  - 295-312
AB  - Wheelchair racing science and the performance of athletes involved in wheelchair 
      racing have developed rapidly in recent years. With increasing interest in this
      sport, the need arises to identify areas where further research is necessary and 
      cooperation between individuals with various backgrounds is encouraged. Many of
      the problems facing investigators in this field require knowledge in several
      areas of science and engineering, which suggests an interdisciplinary approach to
      these issues. Further progress would also benefit from the development of more
      quantitative methods for the classification of wheelchair athletes, or a
      restructuring of the classification system; development of sophisticated
      instrumentation for racing wheelchairs; standardization of test procedures and
      more complete reporting of results of studies; and, more in-depth mathematical
      modelling and computer simulation of wheelchair racing. This review presents an
      overview of four areas of wheelchair racing science: 1) classification of
      wheelchair athletes; 2) design and analysis of racing wheelchairs; 3)
      biomechanics of racing wheelchair propulsion; and, 4) training and coaching of
      wheelchair racers.

TI  - [The coach of artistic gymnastics facing medical problems: results of a survey
      conducted in French-speaking Switzerland].
PG  - 162-6
AB  - The need for high technical skills in gymnastics has resulted in a decrease of
      the age of talented gymnasts. Young gymnasts are submitted to intensive training,
      hence to an increase of the risk of injuries. In spite of this evolution, present
      medical assistance does not appear to be readily accessible to swiss coaches and 
      gymnasts. By necessity, coaches endorse medical functions which have so far not
      been evaluated. This aspect was therefore investigated among coaches from the
      french speaking community of our country. The results show that the present
      medical network hinders regular follow-up of gymnasts and valuable discussions
      between coaches and doctors with, as a result, inappropriate medical teaching.
      Coaches distrust advice given by doctors of whom most underestimate the technical
      aspects of this sport. Medical assistance should be improved on a regional basis.

      it includes not only the subject of sports but also all the other subjects
      concerning health, such as biology and hygiene. Support by other institutions
      besides schools was necessary. The observation period was fixed up to three
      years, the main points being sports and motorial tests and accompanying medical
      care and survey by school doctors from the Public Health Centre. The project was 
      started at the beginning of the school period 1987/88 and will last until the end
      of the school period 1989/90. The surveying period is still too short draw any
      conclusions or to make any statements.

TI  - [Problems in admitting and eliminating children from sports training schools].
PG  - 240-4
AB  - The physical and mental load of children enlisted in the system of preparation
      for top sports is great. It is therefore essential to ensure very careful health 
      care and also very strict criteria for enlistment of children to avoid
      pathological adaptation to the sports load. Specialized sports training of 14-18 
      hours per week may, in case of incorrect compensating activity, be the basis for 
      the development of secondary changes. In the selection it is important to adhere 
      to criteria pertaining to health, performance, function and development and to
      evaluate them in relation to the character of the sports discipline and
      preparation for attaining top performance. Based on six years' experience, it is 
      possible to indicate for the purpose of orientation the risks of different sports
      for the locomotor system during ontogenesis. Cooperation of orthopaedists and
      specialists in sports medicine is the prerequisite of restricting possible
      negative sequelae of local and general overburdening. The conclusion must be
      always the synthesis of all examinations and conclusions must not be drawn from a
      single examination. The authors draw attention to mistakes in the evaluation by
      specialists as a result of lacking knowledge as regards the loading of the
      organism by training in these schools.

TI  - Coaches' goals for young children in a recreational sports program.
PG  - 277-81
AB  - Almost all children participate in sports at some time, and programs are being
      established for even younger children. Adults who coach the children largely
      determine what the children's sports experience will be. Coaches' perceptions of 
      what is important for the young children they instruct have not yet been
      carefully investigated. This study was designed, therefore, to determine coaches'
      goals for young children. Data were gathered by use of an attitude questionnaire 
      administered to 29 coaches of a recreational basketball program of children
      ranging in age from 6 to 10 years old. Of the 12 goals, feeling part of a team,
      learning to do my best, and having fun and excitement were most highly rated as
      extremely important, while becoming popular was lowest rated as not important.
      Results revealed that coaches in general are able to clearly define their goals
      and priorities, and these goals seem developmentally appropriate for the
      children. However, coaches make little differentiation in goals based on age.

TI  - Gender differences in coaching philosophy: the case of female basketball teams.
PG  - 152-8
AB  - With the advent of Title IX, the proportion of female participants in
      interscholastic sport has risen sharply while the proportion of female coaches
      has dropped precipitously. This paper seeks to determine whether there are any
      differences in coaching philosophy by gender. Questionnaires were sent to the
      coaches of 600 high school girls' basketball teams selected randomly from the 48 
      contiguous states. There were 250 usable ones returned for a response rate of
      42%. The questionnaires included items designed to assess the attitudes and
      behaviors of coaches in five areas of coaching philosophy: (1) the coach's role
      in the overall development of athletes; (2) conditions believed essential to
      maximize team performance; (3) team rules used; (4) use of sports aphorisms; and 
      (5) expectations of athletes. Summing the findings, we found that in 83 of the
      100 comparisons there were no statistical differences in the means of the male
      and female coaches. In the 17 instances where there were statistically
      significant differences, 14 times the female coaches were on the more traditional
      side. Several possible explanations for this interesting finding are discussed.

TI  - Predictors of competitive trait anxiety in male youth sport participants.
PG  - 221-9
AB  - This field study examined intrapersonal and significant adult factors related to 
      the levels of dispositional or competitive trait anxiety experienced by 9- to
      14-yr-old male participants of a competitive wrestling program. Competitive trait
      anxiety (CTA) is a personality disposition which reflects the tendency to
      experience stress in situations involving competitive sport (20). Multiple
      regression analyses of questionnaire data revealed that boys with more frequent
      somatic competitive trait anxiety symptoms 1) had lower self-esteem, 2) reported 
      greater upset if they performed poorly, and 3) expressed a greater preference for
      avoiding a tournament match. Investigated cognitive anxiety symptoms involved
      characteristic precompetitive worries about failure and worries about adult
      expectations and evaluation. Youngsters with more frequent worries about failure 
      placed greater importance on wrestling well and felt greater upset when they
      performed poorly, in comparison with boys who worried less frequently about
      failure. More frequent adult-related worries were predicted by greater personal
      upset for poor performance and perceptions of 1) greater parental and coach shame
      and upset, 2) more negative adult evaluations, and 3) greater parental pressure
      to wrestle.

TI  - Preventing nervous system sports injuries.
PG  - 42, 44-6
AB  - Physical fitness and sports remain integral components of overall good health and
      a cornerstone of preventive medicine. When performed safely, under adequate
      supervision, and with appropriate protective gear, most of these activities are
      enjoyable, healthful and psychologically gratifying. When not performed safely by
      trained athletes, these same activities can be treacherous, injurious and
      permanently disabling. The goals of this article are to review and describe
      low-risk and high-risk sports activities. A number of underlying mechanisms
      responsible for a particularly alarming amount of morbidity in sports will be
      reviewed. Fundamentals of the diagnosis and emergency treatment of many injuries 
      will be discussed. Most important, a series of steps to be taken to improve upon 
      sports safety will be outlined. The responsibility for the prevention, diagnosis,
      evaluation and management of patients with nervous system sports injuries is one 
      shared by participating athletes, coaches, trainers and the entire health care
      community.

TI  - Becoming a high school coach: from playing sports to coaching.
PG  - 81-92
AB  - This paper focuses on the processes by which people become high school coaches.
      Occupational choice, professional socialization, and organizational socialization
      are examined, using qualitative data drawn from naturally occurring observations 
      of coaches and informal discussions and in-depth interviews with them. Over 50%
      of the coaches had decided that they wanted to become a coach before entrance
      into college. The decision to become a coach was subjectively warranted by
      personal characteristics and experiences in sports, a devotion to sport, and a
      desire to work with young people. Youth sport coaching and student teaching which
      involved coaching constituted the only formal professional socialization that
      most of the coaches received. However, because almost all of the coaches
      participated in organized youth and/or high school athletics, they had a
      first-hand opportunity to observe their own coaches and acquire some informal
      images and impressions about the coaching occupation from them. Regardless of
      whether a neophyte began as an assistant or a head coach, technical aspects of
      the job and the occupation's culture were acquired by observing and listening to 
      more experienced coaches. Through these experiences, collective understandings
      began to form, and the shared meanings about the occupational culture took shape.
      Reality shock for most novice coaches came in the form of understanding the
      importance the coaching culture assigns to long hours and hard work and to the
      realization that coaching does take an enormous amount of time. By the end of the
      first season, a symbolic transformation takes place and internalization of
      institutional expectations occurs as the neophyte begins to understand what
      coaching is all about.

TI  - Sports-related abdominal trauma.
PG  - 91-9
AB  - Athletes who sustain a direct blow to the abdomen that results in injury to
      spleen, liver, or kidney may have immediate severe pain and may become "shocky"
      quickly. Trainers, EMTs, paramedics, and team physicians should be aware of this 
      possibility. In addition, athletes who have sustained direct blow and have had
      slower bleeding may collapse later either on the field, on the side-lines, or at 
      home. They will be pale, sweaty, may complain of thirst, and the pulse will be
      rapid and thready. If a blow has been sustained that results in abdominal pain,
      the athlete should not be given liquids to drink. If he has collapsed or has
      diffuse abdominal pain he should be kept in a recumbent position, and the legs
      should be elevated in order to assist blood in returning to the heart
      (Trendelenberg position). If hypotensive shock is present, the PASG antishock
      garment should be applied. In cases in which there is serious concern about an
      intra-abdominal injury or the patient has collapsed in shock, transport to a
      hospital, preferably to a trauma center, should be effected as rapidly as
      possible. There should not be excessive delays in starting intravenous fluids or 
      administering time-consuming procedures in the field. Truly serious
      intra-abdominal injuries as a result of nonvehicular sports-related incidents are
      not common. It is precisely for this reason that they are dangerous. Teammates,
      parents, trainers, coaches, EMTs, and paramedics are not accustomed to seeing
      them with any frequency. Because of this, the early signs of injury are often
      unrecognized, even in cases that progress to shock or collapse.(ABSTRACT

TI  - Sports competition and its influence on self-esteem development.
PG  - 861-9
AB  - Competition and its influence upon the adolescent is the primary concern of many 
      recreational agencies. In the past ten years, many youth agencies have
      de-emphasized competition in their programs because of its negative influence
      upon self-esteem. There is a need to examine the relationship between competition
      and self-esteem so that recreational programs can be better designed to utilize
      competition as a positive factor. A study was undertaken to examine self-esteem
      in relation to competition in a basketball program. It was found that the coach's
      assessments of ability and intention of participation are important factors in
      positive self-esteem development. The social aspects of peer interaction and
      parent influence also contribute to positive self-esteem. These are minor
      elements, however, in comparison to the impact of the coach. There needs to be
      intensive training for coaches on how to develop positive self-esteem and how to 
      deal with the range of participation styles.

TI  - [Physical activity and sports as health promoting behavior in middle age].
PG  - 289-95
AB  - In any preventive health care program for middle aged adults and elderly people, 
      the promotion of physical fitness activities has become an item of priority.
      However, the increased awareness of the importance of being physically fit is in 
      contrast with the limited number of adults actually involved in physical fitness 
      activities. This study focuses on the reasons for in-activity as well as on the
      perceived motivation to participate in a fitness program. Health was found, as
      expected, to be the most important motive to start participation in a physical
      fitness program. Even most of the non-active adults believed that for health
      reasons they should exercise regularly. Reasons for inactivity included fatigue
      and lack of energy, lack of time (other things are more important and enjoyable),
      inadequate facilities, experiencing no health difficulties which would indicate
      the need for exercise, the implications for their lifestyle and fear of potential
      health hazards associated with physical fitness activities. Adherence to habitual
      physical activity was motivated by social support and socializing opportunities
      and the experience of relaxation, recreation and relief of tension. The
      discrepancy between knowing about health and fitness and really participating in 
      a fitness program is interpreted in terms of cognitive processes, behaviour
      modification and changing health life-styles.

TI  - Sport and medicine in ancient Greece.
PG  - 594-6
AB  - Sport and medicine in ancient Greece were the result of a widespread tradition of
      liberty, which was at the heart of one of the most brilliant civilizations in
      history. Whereas war encouraged the development of surgical knowledge springing
      out of medical experience on the battlefield, peace promoted the burgeoning of
      sport as an integral part of Greek upbringing, allowing the channeling of young
      people's aggressiveness into physical competition. Medicine was magical and
      mythological, especially in the time of Homer (9th century BC); Aesculapius, the 
      mythical god of healing, was its reference point. With Hippocrates (5th century
      BC), the body of medical experience was to be codified and built up, and was to
      undergo a novel evolution based on the theory of the balance of the four humors. 
      The athlete's mentality, faced with trauma in the sports ground, underwent a
      change; injury was no longer considered a punishment by the gods. At the same
      time, temple offerings tendered in the hope of victory gave way to the athlete's 
      personal preparation based on a specifically modified lifestyle, diet, and
      training. The resulting progress in medicine and public health, especially from
      the 5th century BC onward, was not only to favor athletic performances of high
      quality but also surgical techniques that were very advanced for their time. Thus
      it can be seen that the medical knowledge associated with the practice of sport
      progressed during antiquity because of its obligation to follow the warrior and
      then the athlete.

TI  - Management of sports injuries in children and adolescents.
PG  - 689-98
AB  - In general, child and youth sports are safe. The vast multitude of injuries
      sustained are mild contusions, sprains, and strains. Major catastrophic injuries 
      are rare. Overuse injuries secondary to repetitive, unrepaired microtrauma are
      becoming a more common source of injury. Children must not be thought of as
      simply small adults. Physiologically and emotionally, children, youth, and
      adolescents all vary in rate and magnitude of maturation in these spheres. The
      vast majority of sports-related injuries in children and adolescents require
      neither hospitalization nor surgery but lend themselves to out-patient treatment.
      The practice of preventive medicine is encouraged, and orthopedists should take
      an active part in advising patients about equipment and training programs to
      prevent coach and parental abuses that may lead to musculoskeletal long-term
      disabilities.

PG  - 157-65
AB  - The purpose of this study was twofold: (a) to outline a demographic profile of
      Quebec minor hockey coaches and (b) to identify their motives of involvement and 
      resignation. A questionnaire was completed by 333 current coaches and by 175
      former coaches from the Quebec City area. Results showed that these volunteers
      are very similar on all counts. They are fathers of at least one boy who is a
      hockey player, and they come from all socio-economic strata. They are former
      hockey players and are well aware of the activities of the professional teams.
      They perceive themselves as being competent coaches and are satisfied with their 
      results. They highly value hockey as a means of education and perceive their own 
      role of volunteer as being an unselfish one geared toward youth education. On the
      other hand, they perceive the other volunteers' involvement as being
      self-interested and mainly due to the child's primary participation.

TI  - Decision styles and coaching effectiveness in university soccer.
PG  - 56-65
AB  - The Normative Model for Decision Styles in Coaching (Chelladurai and Haggerty,
      1978) was empirically tested using Canadian Intercollegiate (CIAU) soccer teams. 
      The subsequent utility of the model's prescriptions for optimizing decision
      styles of soccer coaches was seriously questioned. Only 33% agreement was found
      with the model's prescriptions for both CIAU coaches and their athletes. Neither 
      coaches nor athletes were particularly inclined to use delegation in decision
      making. Athletes, more than their coaches, preferred consultative styles. In
      support of research findings from business and industrial settings, there was
      evidence to suggest that high congruence scores between a coach's decision styles
      and those preferred and perceived by athletes, could predict athlete perceptions 
      of coaching effectiveness.

      message is "Be prepared". A team approach and suitable ambulance and hospital
      back-up are mandatory. Individual management of a specific acute injury should be
      approached with a practice plan. Collars, splints, back board, doctor's bag, ambu
      bag, suture tray and emergency medications should be at hand. Care must be taken 
      that no long-term harm befalls the player. The attending physician must be
      knowledgeable about preventive equipment and immediate institution of
      rehabilitation procedures, and must try to inform the coach or trainer and parent
      as to when the athlete can safely return to play. It is important that the
      athlete not return to play until he/she is 100% fit.

AB  - The development of preventive provisions is an important topic of sport accident 
      research. We demonstrate the stepwise procedure of judging a provision taking the
      analysis of a gymnastic exercise. This includes determination of the inner and
      outer reasons of accidents, the biomechanical conditions of the exercise and
      leads to mathematical and experimental simulation of the dangerous movement. The 
      specific exercise we studied was the efficiency of a coach in protecting position
      for the handstand somersault with 1 1/2 breakneck leap. The reaction ability of
      the coach during the exercise and his force capacity to prevent an accident is
      explored by a newly developed reaction time analyzer and by a catapult apparatus 
      throwing a dummy. Our results show the inadequacy of the prevention provision of 
      a coach in protecting position for the special gymnastic exercise.

TI  - [Effect of vitamins and iron on performance and recovery in humans and in sports 
      anemia].
PG  - 21-42
AB  - In sports, vitamins along with minerals, particularly iron, and the energy
      nutrients such as carbohydrates, are considered especially important. Frequently 
      single or multiple vitamins in combination with other active substances such as
      iron, other minerals or carbohydrates are administered. In sports, vitamins are
      added to carbohydrate mixtures or electrolytes enriched with vitamins are offered
      and frequently used. There is no doubt that due to the numerous effects of
      vitamins, a connection must exist between the vitamin status and athletic
      performance capability. It can be concluded that vitamin deficiencies have a
      negative effect on physical and mental performance. The release of energy can
      only attain its maximum output when the organism has the required substances at
      its disposal. Iron is of central importance among these active substances, since 
      its presence in haemoglobin is essential for the transport of oxygen and carbon
      dioxide, makes it possible for myoglobin to function as an oxygen supply depot
      and guarantees the functioning of internal respiration in the respiratory chain
      and various key enzymes. Muscle training increases not only the respiratory chain
      but also several other iron-rich enzymes. This makes even more astonishing the
      fact that a variety of recently published articles report on iron deficiency
      among athletes. The effect of the iron deficiency with anaemia (sports anaemia)
      is manifest in a reduction of aerobic capacity with an increase in lactate
      acidosis, greater fatigue, loss of appetite, muscular cramps and vasomotor
      disturbances.

PG  - 37-40
AB  - The purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of a change of rules in
      Ringette on the attitude of the players toward the sport. A total of 332 players 
      and observers (coaches, officials and parents) completed two attitude scales
      dealing with an old and a new rule on zone restriction in Ringette. Results,
      (331) = 22.23, p less than .0001, indicate that there has been a change of
      attitude in the subjects. The fact that Ringette is played with a new rule (no
      zone restriction) seems to be responsible for a more favourable attitude toward
      the sport. Reasons explaining this change of attitude are discussed in the paper.

TI  - Predicting athletic performance with self-confidence and somatic and cognitive
      anxiety as a function of motor and physiological requirements in six sports.
PG  - 139-53
AB  - The purpose of the present study is to examine the ability of certain
      psychological attributes to predict performance in six National Collegiate
      Athletic Association Division I collegiate sports. Eighty-four athletes from the 
      varsity sports teams of cross country running, alpine and nordic skiing, tennis, 
      basketball, and track and field at the University of Colorado completed a
      questionnaire adapted from Martens (1977; Martens et al., 1983) that measured
      their trait levels of self-confidence (Bandura, 1977), somatic anxiety, and
      cognitive anxiety (Martens, 1977; Martens et al., 1983). In addition, at three to
      six competitions during the season, the members of the cross country running and 
      tennis teams filled out a state measure (Martens et al., 1983) of the three
      attributes from one to two hours prior to the competition. Following each
      competition, subjective and objective ratings of performance were obtained, and, 
      for all sports, coaches' ratings of performance and an overall seasonal team
      ranking were determined as seasonal performance measures. The sports were
      dichotomized along motor and physiological dimensions. Results indicate that all 
      three psychological attributes were significant predictors of performance in both
      fine motor, anaerobic sports and gross motor, aerobic sports. Further, clear
      differences in these relationships emerged as a function of the dichotomization. 
      In addition, unexpected sex differences emerged. The findings are discussed
      relative to prior research and their implications for future research.

TI  - Children in competitive sports--a multi-disciplinary approach.
PG  - 162-72
AB  - This article is divided into two parts: Part 1 consists of the position stand of 
      The Canadian Association of Applied Sport Sciences on the involvement of children
      in competitive sports, and Part II presents scientific background and rationale
      pertinent to the position statements. Each part is divided into major categories 
      reflecting the multi-disciplinary concerns of the participation of pre- and
      post-pubescent children in sport situations at all levels. Psychological
      considerations focus on the child learning a sense of competence and control
      through sport participation. Success in a sport should not be based solely on
      winning, but on one's own performance and attained goals. Sport involvement can
      provide one important avenue for a child's social development. Non-aggressive
      behaviour and a constructive problem-solving approach should be encouraged. Any
      form of discrimination towards sport participation or competition should be
      discouraged. From the physiological and medical point of view, it should be
      recognized that each child is different in his/her response and tolerance to
      exercise due to a great range of variability in growth rates, anthropometric
      indices, gender and state of health, even in children of a similar chronological 
      age. Younger prepubertal children should be encouraged to participate in a wide
      variety of motor skills, whereas older post-pubertal children can become more
      specialized in their training and sport participation. A child's performance and 
      adaptation to training should not be directly compared to an adult's as
      significant differences exist, especially during the years of accelerated growth.
      Environmental exercise tolerance is also more limited to children than adults. In
      younger children repetitive heavy loading of the musculoskeletal system should be
      approached with caution. With proper equipment design and usage, and rule
      modifications, serious injuries can be avoided. Medical disabilities should be
      evaluated on an individual basis and should not necessarily preclude a child's
      participation. Teachers, parents and coaches should have a thorough understanding
      of the implications of children involved in sports and adhere to the
      recommendations reviewed in this statement.

TI  - Mouth guards for the prevention of injuries in contact sports.
PG  - 415-27
AB  - There has been a significant increase in the number of individuals participating 
      in contact sports. As a result, every effort must be made to provide the athletes
      with protection against mouth injuries. In this review the use, construction and 
      benefits of mouthguards in all sports has been described. There is unanimous
      opinion attesting to the benefits of such protective devices and in those sports 
      where the athlete is required to wear a mouth guard, a dramatic decrease in the
      number and severity of injuries has been reported. Custom-fitted mouth guards
      should be used in many sports that do not already have a compulsory rule
      requiring their use. Physicians, dentists, trainers and coaches need to be
      educated on the data supporting the benefits described. Studies on performance
      enhancement as a result of mandibular orthopaedic repositioning appliances have
      also been reviewed. Long term studies are required to assess the claims of
      ergogenic enhancement utilising proper study design. Current evidence exists
      relating to the effects of psychological phenomena on athletic performance, and
      it is believed the placebo effect contributes to the findings of performance
      improvement.

TI  - [Anabolic steroids and sports].
PG  - 453-6
AB  - Anabolic steroids are derivatives of androgens with less androgenic and stronger 
      anabolic actions. They should be used for therapeutic indications only. Their
      misuse to improve physical performance is unethical (doping), illegal and of
      doubtful pharmacological value. Together with intense muscular exercise and
      high-protein diet, anabolics due to their anabolic and anti-catabolic actions
      possibly increase physical performance and enhance recovery in athletes where
      added strength is a great advantage. In most sport disciplines a beneficial
      effect has not been demonstrated. Like all active drugs, anabolics can cause
      side-effects. They depend on structure, dosage and duration of administration.
      The misuse by athletes of high doses during long periods should be a particular
      motivation for doctors, teachers and coaches to discourage athletes from using
      anabolic drugs. The dangers of overdosing and long-term use are emphasized,
      search for untoward side- and after- effects by regular and careful controls is
      recommended.

TI  - Stress inoculation training to control anxiety in sport: two case studies in
      squash.
PG  - 115-7
AB  - This study arose as a result of two squash players, one male one female, seeking 
      advice on how to improve their mental approach to playing. They both felt that
      their game suffered badly through too much anxiety. After preliminary interviews 
      it was decided to use a programme of stress inoculation training to help them
      learn to control their anxiety. In order to obtain baseline measures of anxiety, 
      both subjects completed a state anxiety questionnaire on five occasions,
      immediately prior to playing important league or team matches. They were then
      given eight training sessions. On completion of the training, subjects were asked
      to complete a further five state anxiety tests immediately prior to analogous
      matches. There was a considerable decrease in self-reported anxiety levels and
      both players reported that their performance had improved. It is argued that
      stress inoculation training is potentially very useful as a technique for
      controlling anxiety in certain competitive sports.

TI  - Viral illnesses and sports performance.
PG  - 298-303
AB  - Viruses are ubiquitous and cause numerous infections in humans. These may vary
      from asymptomatic infection to severe debilitating illness. Viruses enter the
      host cells to replicate, using host synthetic mechanisms, and, thus, are
      resistant to conventional antibiotics. The human body responds to viral infection
      by synthesising specific antibody which can be used to aid diagnosis. Infectious 
      mononucleosis (glandular fever) commonly affects the 15 to 30 years age group. It
      may produce severe debility which may last a month or more. Coxsackie virus
      infection can produce symptoms of the common cold but may also invade heart
      muscle and produce myocarditis, a potentially serious disease. Other viruses also
      produce a wide spectrum of disease. Recent evidence has shown that people
      undergoing severe mental or physical stress may have reduced immunity to viral
      infections. There are risks associated with strenuous physical activity during
      the acute phase of viral infection, and there are reports of sudden death and
      serious complications occurring in previously fit young adults who undertake
      vigorous exercise when in the acute phase of a viral illness. Abnormalities of
      skeletal muscle have been demonstrated in patients with viral infection and this 
      may explain the loss of performance experienced by athletes after upper
      respiratory tract infection. As a general rule, for all but mild common colds, it
      is advised that the athlete avoids hard training for the first month after
      infection.

PG  - 157-61
AB  - The purpose of this study was to provide an assessment tool to judge coaching
      performance that was appropriate for completion by athletes. The questionnaire
      underwent a variety of developmental stages. In its final form, it contained 36
      items. The tool was shown to be a valid, reliable, and standardized
      questionnaire. It demonstrated discriminability and provoked honest, accurate
      responding in subjects. The test was capable of providing immediate feedback to
      coaches seeking information about athletes' perceptions of their coaching
      performance. Responses on the developed scale were weighted to reflect the
      desirability of the coaching characteristics of a good coach. The questionnaire
      provides a total score which can be interpreted by the coach as a measure of how 
      much of an "ideal" coach exists in him/her.

TI  - Overuse injuries in sports. A review.
PG  - 316-33
AB  - Because knowledge of overuse syndromes is limited, the diagnosis and treatment of
      these conditions are a challenge to sports medicine physicians. Trial and error
      methods of treatment and too little attention to basic research have resulted in 
      less than optimum solutions. We do know that these maladies most frequently
      result from overload or repetitive microtrauma stemming from extrinsic factors
      such as training errors, poor performance, poor techniques and inappropriate
      surfaces or intrinsic factors including malalignment and muscle imbalance.
      Overuse injuries involving the muscles include compartment syndromes and muscle
      soreness; while those involving the tendons result from a variety of degenerative
      and inflammatory processes. Overstress of bone results in stress fractures,
      apophysitis and periostitis. Bursitis and joint overstress problems are also
      discussed briefly. General guidelines for establishing the appropriate diagnosis 
      are: the initial stages of therapy require rest, often a modification or scaled
      down exposure to the athlete's usual performance rather than complete abstinence;
      in acutely symptomatic cases pain medications and various measures to control
      inflammation may be necessary; an exercise programme should start early with
      range of motion exercises and isometric muscle contractions; when pain allows,
      dynamic muscle and flexibility exercises can resume together with a conditioning 
      programme; if possible, eccentric exercises should be performed. The treatment
      may also include other conservative treatment modalities and surgery in special
      cases. Overuse injuries constitute a great diagnostic and therapeutic problem
      because the symptoms are often diffuse and uncharacteristic. An appropriate
      diagnosis followed by adequate treatment can improve or eliminate most of these
      conditions, but perhaps even more importantly a proper understanding of overuse
      syndromes should allow physicians to assist athletes, trainers, and coaches in
      preventing them.

TI  - Basic neurophysiology of motor skills in sport: a review.
PG  - 2-14
AB  - The broad spectrum of skills in sport, with their high demands on strength,
      speed, endurance, coordination, and flexibility, represents one of the greatest
      challenges to human motor performances. However, the basic neurophysiological
      mechanisms in sport are not principally different from those in everyday motor
      acts. This review describes some of the relevant neurophysiological facts in a
      comprehensive frame, with emphasis on new findings and changes of traditional
      concepts. Going from simple to increasingly complex processes, the following
      chapters, each with several subtopics, will be treated: peripheral and spinal
      building blocks of motoricity; elementary grammar of the spinal cord; some
      aspects of spinal/supraspinal coordination in the brainstem; achievements and
      problems of cerebral motor control; and principles of motor learning in sport. In
      conclusion, the recent progress in neurophysiological research on motor systems
      allows recognition of a substantially new trend, a change of "paradigms": old
      mechanistic concepts of reflex chains and motor functions, like a complicated
      automation, are increasingly replaced by the idea of a sensing, planning, and
      self-operating subject whose mental processes are decisive for motor behavior,
      particularly in sport. Further mutual stimulation and support can be expected
      from this development between the science of sport and that of neuro- and
      psychophysiology.

TI  - The influence of socializing agents in the female sport-participation process.
PG  - 73-82
AB  - This study investigated the influence of socializing agents on the female
      athletes who participated in the Empire State Games in Syracuse, New York (N =
      587). When comparisons were made across life-cycle states (under-13, junior high,
      and senior high), it was discovered that statistically significant differences
      existed (p less than 0.0001). It was apparent that the socializing agent
      influences changed from being mostly parental at the under-13 life-cycle stage to
      mostly coach/teacher oriented during junior and senior high school years. No
      significant differences occurred across the three life-cycle stages when the
      following items were examined: (a) the number of sports in which the female
      athletes participated, (b) the number of sports learned by the female athletes,
      and (c) the amount of sport interest developed. It was concluded that socializing
      agent influences do exist, but change during different periods in the life cycle.

AB  - In contrast to recreative sports, competition should not be allowed in children
      without regulations and supervision. Physical handicaps should be carefully
      looked for through a thorough pre-participation examination and appropriate
      physical activities should be defined for handicapped children. Hypoactivity,
      fear of accident and functional deterioration cause more damage to these children
      than physical training which may include competition provided the underlying
      disease is adequately treated. Regular physical exercise appears to provide
      significant physical and psychological benefits which are effective beyond the
      period of physical activity. Stress and aggressivity linked to competition do not
      seem to have harmful effects on child mental health, with an exception for elite 
      adolescent athletes for whom more information is needed. These athletes are at
      risk for orthopaedic lesions by overuse as well as disturbances of cardiac and
      endocrine functions which may disqualify them temporarily for sport events.
      Treatments designed to boost performance such as anabolic steroids, amphetamines 
      or blood transfusions should be strictly forbidden.

TI  - Medical psychology in exercise and sport.
PG  - 123-43
AB  - Several psychological outcomes that accompany acute and chronic exercise have
      medical significance. Transient reductions in somatic tension and subjective
      anxiety appear most reliable. Symptom abatement in moderate depression can occur 
      with chronic exercise in a manner comparable to psychotherapy and may offer a
      better prognosis in some instances. Other cognitive, behavioral, and perceptual
      events associated with exercise may assist in managing mental health, and
      exercise has been successfully used as a therapeutic adjunct in a variety of
      psychiatric disorders. Regular exercise may also complement treatments designed
      to manage aspects of coronary-prone behavior and psychoendocrine responsivity to 
      mental stress. The lack of strict experimental control or effective placebo
      contrasts in most exercise studies precludes a convincing argument that exercise 
      causes the psychological outcomes observed. Rather, expectancy of benefits,
      generalized treatment or attention effects, social reinforcement, and past
      history or selection bias represent likely alternatives. These competing
      explanations do not discount, however, that many individuals benefit in a
      clinically significant way. Exercise offers a low-cost alternative or adjunct
      with side effects that appear largely health-related. Although the effective
      psychological dosage or modality has not been quantified, current physiologic
      guidelines of the American College of Sports Medicine (large muscle rhythmic
      activity, for 20 to 60 minutes, 3 to 5 days per week at 60 to 80 per cent
      age-adjusted maximal heart rate), or a weekly caloric cost of 2000 kcal, should
      be effective with little medical risk. However, no evidence confirms that an
      increase in metabolic or psychoendocrine tolerance to exercise is necessary or
      sufficient for psychological outcomes to occur. Although biologic adaptations are
      known to follow exercise training and subside with diminished activity, there is 
      currently no objective evidence that habitual exercise leads to dependence. If
      exercise has use in managing subjective or somatic symptoms, these may return
      during periods of exercise abstinence. Moreover, despite popular hypotheses
      concerning endorphins and biogenic amines, no direct relationships have yet been 
      shown between exercise-induced mood swings and peripheral biochemical events. A
      proportion of habitual runners have reported acute episodes of euphoria-like
      states during or following exercise, but this remains a subjective and
      unpredictable event that may be related to psychophysiologic relaxation or acute 
      changes in self-esteem.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

TI  - The coaching preferences of elite athletes competing at Universiade '83.
PG  - 201-8
AB  - The study investigated the coaching preferences of 95 male and 65 female elite
      athletes competing at Universiade '83 (Edmonton, Canada). Preferred coaching
      behaviour (PCB) was measured using a version of the Leadership Scale for Sports
      (Chelladurai and Saleh, 1978, 1980). Preference scores were analyzed on the basis
      of sex, age, nationality, and type of sport. A MANOVA indicated that males prefer
      significantly more Autocratic behaviour than females (p = .039). Also, athletes
      in team sports prefer significantly more Training behaviour (p = .001),
      Autocratic behaviour (p less than .001), and Rewarding behaviour (p = .017), and 
      significantly less Democratic behaviour (p less than .001) and Social Support
      behaviour (p = .002) than athletes in individual sports. No significant
      differences in PCB attributable to the age or nationally of the athlete were
      found. In addition, data collected in a previous study (Terry and Howe, 1984),
      which examined the PCB of 'club' athletes, was included to facilitate a
      comparison of club v elite athletes. A MANOVA showed that elite athletes prefer
      significantly more Democratic behaviour (p = .01) and Social Support behaviour (p
      = .001), and significantly less Rewarding behaviour (p = .01) than athletes at a 
      'club' level. Although differences between subject groups were found, it can be
      concluded that athletes generally tend to favour coaches who "often" display
      Training behaviour and Rewarding behaviour, "occasionally" display Democratic
      behaviour and Social Support behaviour, and "seldom" display Autocratic
      behaviour.

AB  - The study examined the coaching preferences of 80 male and 80 female athletes, as
      measured by the Leadership Scale for Sports (Chelladurai and Saleh, 1978, 1980). 
      In addition, it attempted to assess the applicability to sport of the Life-cycle 
      and Path-goal theories of leadership. Comparisons between groups were made on the
      basis of sex, age, and type of sport. A MANOVA indicated that athletes in
      independent sports preferred more democratic behaviour (p less than .001) and
      less autocratic behaviour (p = .028) than athletes in interdependent sports. No
      differences in coaching preferences were found which could be attributed to the
      age or sex of the athlete, or the variability of the sports task. These results
      partially supported the Path-goal theory, but did not support the Life-cycle
      theory. Athletes of all groups tended to favour coaches who displayed training
      behaviour and rewarding behaviour "often", democratic behaviour and social
      support behaviour "occasionally", and autocratic behaviour "seldom". This
      consistency may be a useful finding for those organizations and institutions
      interested in preparing coaches.

      common problems.
PG  - 45-50
AB  - Upper extremity syndromes caused by a single stress or by repetitive microtrauma 
      occur in a variety of sports. The throwing motion, long-distance swimming,
      bowling, golf, gymnastics, basketball, volleyball, and field events can
      repetitively stress the hand, wrist, elbow, and shoulder. The biomechanical
      evaluation of racquet handling, throwing, and swimming motions has progressed
      considerably, and the future looks promising for better identification and
      prevention of sports injuries due to stress. These insights will help the
      physician more adequately understand and treat athletic injuries. As for the
      present, we must recognize athletic injuries for what they are--debilitating
      single or repetitive trauma to active persons who want a rapid return to their
      sport. The goal of both the injured athlete and the treating physician must be
      100% recovery; compromise in treatment is not warranted. To achieve the best
      results, the physician should emphasize to the athlete, coach, and parent that
      healing is a matter of time.

TI  - Nutrition knowledge of high school athletic coaches in Texas.
PG  - 672-4, 677
AB  - A study was conducted by mail questionnaire to assess concepts of nutrition as
      related to athletes that coaches in Texas accept and are likely to disseminate.
      Background information included training in nutrition, sources of nutrition
      information, and frequency of distribution of dietary advice. Eighty-five percent
      of the coaches scored below 70% on knowledge of nutrition. Seventy-three percent,
      however, believed they were adequately informed about nutrition, and 86% dispense
      nutrition information regularly. Results of the study indicate a need for better 
      nutrition education for high school athletic coaches.

AB  - It has been estimated that one-third of all children between 6 and 14 years old
      are involved in some type of organized sports activity. These facts and figures
      serve to demonstrate that many children seen by the nurse practitioner will be
      participating in sports. This article describes important issues in counseling
      and educating parents, children, schools and coaches; screening examinations for 
      participation; common injuries to the young athlete and treatment of injuries. By
      intervening in these aspects of sports participation, nurse practitioners may be 
      able to protect young patients both psychologically and physically from the
      hazards of inappropriate athletic programs.

TI  - Impact of coaching certification on coaching attitudes.
PG  - 180-8
AB  - The purpose of the present investigation was to examine the impact of coaching
      certification upon coaching attitudes toward important social psychological
      correlates of involvement in sport. Specifically, 249 coaches with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 
      and 5 levels of certification in the National Coaching Certification Program for 
      Hockey were compared on attitudes toward important social psychological
      correlates of athletic involvement. As a consequence of anomalies in the sample, 
      the six levels of certification were collapsed to form a factorial design
      comprising 2 levels of certification (coaches with 0.1 and 2 levels versus
      coaches with 3, 4, and 5 levels) and 2 levels of competition (house league versus
      competitive league coaches). The results revealed that coaches with greater
      certification were older and more experienced. Also, coaches in competitive
      leagues were more experienced, attached more importance to setting realistic
      objectives and playing well, but less importance to providing a recreational
      experience for players than house league coaches. Also, with increasing
      certification, coaches in competitive leagues attached increased importance to
      beating an opponent and having a winning team while house league coaches showed a
      decrease. Finally, the emphasis planed upon providing equal ice time for all
      players remained low over the two levels of certification in the competitive
      league coaches; it showed a decrease with greater certification in the house
      league coaches.

AB  - Sport and physical activity are highly desirable components of normal development
      in children. They contribute towards health, fitness, achievement and the
      discipline required to learn and associate with peers. It is important to provide
      adequate supervision and skills coaching in order to avoid injuries and foster
      ongoing interest in exercise programmes. The child athlete is susceptible to
      several unique injuries due to the normal growth process and the practitioner
      needs to be aware of these and familiar with the diagnosis and management of such
      conditions in order to protect the wellbeing and development of his child athlete
      patients.

TI  - The handicapped in sports.
PG  - 183-90
AB  - The first U.S.O.C. workshop on sports medicine for the handicaPped athlete led to
      several conclusions. First and foremost, the disabled athlete as an amateur
      athlete with a desire to participate must ever be uppermost in our minds, hearts,
      and planning. It appears that one of our chief objectives within the U.S.O.C.
      should be a central unifying force operating with joint support of the Sports
      Medicine Council and the Handicapped in Sports Committee, under the Sports
      Medicine Division. This arrangement will serve as an information and clearing
      center for the better understanding of each other and each organization of sports
      for the disabled athletes. We need to identify and classify for attention the
      common problems inherent among these groups and coordinate our various efforts.
      Fundamental to improvement in the application of sports medicine concepts is
      development of a definite plan for the education of voluntary coaches and trained
      or professionally prepared coaches, athletic trainers, physical therapists, and
      physicians. A variety of concurrent approaches are feasible with initiative and
      sharing of resources. An additional venture must be to begin pooling and
      computerizing our present and future information in this regard (professional
      articles and medical records) within the U.S.O.C. information retrieval system.
      This must be systematized so the pertinent information can then the disseminated 
      and furnished nationwide to anyone or any group dealing with the disabled athlete
      in sports. Ultimately, our objective is to make this information available to all
      handicapped people.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Behavioral assessment in youth sports: coaching behaviors and children's
      attitudes.
PG  - 208-14
AB  - To define the characteristics and dimensional patterning of coaching behaviors,
      15,449 behaviors of 31 youth basketball coaches were coded in terms of a
      10-category system. Post-season attitude and self-esteem data were obtained from 
      players on 23 teams and were related to the behavioral measures. Compared with
      rates of reinforcement, encouragement, and technical instruction, punitive
      responses occurred relatively infrequently. Factor analysis of the coaching
      behaviors indicated that supportive and punitive behavioral dimensions were
      orthogonal or statistically independent of one another rather than opposite ends 
      of the same dimension. Punitive and instructional categories were part of the
      same behavior cluster. The relationship between coaching behaviors and the
      various player attitudes were highly specific in nature. Coaching behaviors
      accounted for about half of the variance in post-season attitudes toward the
      coach and the sport, but for significantly less variance in measures of team
      solidarity and self-esteem. Surprisingly, the rate of positive reinforcement was 
      unrelated to any of the attitudinal measures. Punishment was negatively related
      to liking for the coach. In general, technical instruction categories were the
      strongest predictors of basketball player attitudes.

TI  - On the meaning of sports: cross cultural observations of super stress.
PG  - 11-28
AB  - The definition of sports medicine indicates the possible therapeutic and research
      importance of games in the work of social scientists and clinicians. A
      cross-cultural comparison of super stressful competitions provides one insight
      into the importance of games in human societies. Fourteen such comparisons are
      made between Indians in Mexico who run 250-mile foot races and Americans in
      Alaska who conduct 1049-mile dog sled races. It is concluded that sports can help
      understand how a society defines itself and regulates violence. Games may be an
      essential "human-specific' need which provide entertainment, retain survival
      skills, ameliorate existential anxiety and promote religious and/or secular
      socialization. In this study, humans seem willing, if not insistent, to deploy
      considerable resources of time and material to sustain competitions among their
      own species, as well as between and with other species. A "sports history' is
      important for all individuals.

      sport can have a preventive effect in regard to the development of so-called
      problem behaviour (criminality, alcohol abuse, drug abuse etc.) is discussed. The
      article then outlines positive and negative psychosocial effects of sport on the 
      child and adolescent in general, independent of whether problem behaviour

TI  - The prevention of orofacial sports injuries in the adolescent.
PG  - 313-9
AB  - Custom-made mouthguards are effective in reducing orofacial injuries to junior
      players. A significant reduction or total elimination of these injuries can be
      expected when mouthguards are used. An acceptable custom-made mouthguard can be
      constructed for every adolescent; therefore, they can and should be used in
      contact sport at junior level. This will help young people to become accustomed
      to these protective devices at an early age. It is important that first
      mouthguards are comfortable and that adaptations are done whenever needed to
      ensure that the recipients will want to continue to use these devices. Sports
      bodies and coaches should do more to enforce the use of mouthguards at all
      levels. The high incidence of injuries to the oral region makes their use
      essential. The time has now come for the use of mouthguards to be made compulsory
      by contact sports authorities, first, for all senior teams, and subsequently for 
      high school and even primary school pupils. Most parents and many dentists are
      still unaware of injury hazards and (more importantly) the protection available. 
      A team dentist, where there is a possibility of dental injury, is the ideal
      situation. One dentist can easily be the team dentist for a number of teams,
      acting as professional adviser, fitting and adjusting mouthguards and ensuring
      that trauma (or dental disease) is treated by the player's own dentist.

TI  - Biochemical variability in a tem sports situation.
PG  - 12-7
AB  - Using 13 members of an amateur softball team during the last seven games of the
      regular season, associations were determined between overall offensive and
      defensive performance and levels of serum uric acid (SUA) and cholesterol, and
      urinary adrenaline and noradrenaline. Skilled players were found to have
      significantly lower cholesterol and noradrenaline levels than less skilled
      players whether the games were won or lost. Adrenaline and SUA levels did not
      differ between the two groups nor between losing or winning outcomes. The
      elevated cholesterol and noradrenaline levels found among the less skilled
      players may indicate that although they were stressed by the discrepancy between 
      their expectations and their performance, they nonetheless maintained perceived
      control over performance because of the social support and reinforcement received
      from the other players and the coach.

PG  - 93-7
AB  - Both interval and continuous training are necessary in order to maximize the
      endurance athlete's potential for competition. Continuous submaximal training
      exerts its greatest effect upon the oxygen transport system of the body, while
      high intensity endurance-interval training exerts its greatest effect on the
      structural and biochemical properties of the muscle. The physiological basis for 
      both forms of training is discussed and recommendations are made for year-round
      training and training to elevate the anaerobic threshold.

AB  - The aims of medicine in sport--treatment and prevention of injury of
      high-performance athletes, rehabilitation--and its beneficial effects are
      considered. The types of sporting injuries are described. Collision and contact
      sports tend to be characterised by injuries caused by direct or indirect trauma, 
      while athletic injuries tend to result from a variety of factors that, instead of
      producing excellence as intended, produce injury. The physiological changes in a 
      top-class sportsman may also be characteristic of disease, making diagnosis of
      injury difficult. The importance of the sportsman's mental attitude is stressed.

PG  - 251-70
AB  - Statistics on catastrophic head and neck injuries in football provide a more
      realistic indication of the incidence of serious injuries occurring on the
      football field than do the fatality figures. These statistics, however, provide
      no clues for preventing such injuries. Moreover, research using head models,
      anesthetized animals, cadaveric heads, and estimates of brain tolerance to impact
      based on studies of actual injuries to the heads of humans has produced
      conflicting data with respect to the goal of improving the safety record of the
      sport. To reconcile the data and to provide some solutions to the problem of
      serious injuries on the playing field, we reviewed the data collected in the
      laboratory and correlated it with the information obtained from telemetry
      studies. As a result of combining these two data sources, we concluded that
      injuries on the playing field occur at either end of the spectrum of offered
      resistance: when too much resistance is offered and when little or no resistance 
      is offered. We demonstrated that, by avoiding either of these extremes, serious
      injuries to the head and neck can be reduced considerably. Finally, we discussed 
      the importance of preprogrammed responses by the experienced, well-conditioned
      athlete. These allow the athlete to avoid either extreme of resistance and,
      thereby, protect him from injury. Clearly, the data obtained from laboratory and 
      telemetry studies will prove instrumental in effecting changes in the sport of
      football. As a result of these studies, we can hope for alterations in the design
      of the helmet, enlightened coaching techniques, and rule revisions--all of which 
      will serve to make football a safe sport.

TI  - Behavioral coaching in the development of skills in football, gymnastics, and
      tennis.
PG  - 297-314
AB  - A review of the literature indicates that methods of skill acquisition based on
      the operant paradigm have been scientifically validated with many motor
      behaviors. However, these procedures have been limited to the use of positive
      reinforcement for correct performance when applied to the acquisition of complex 
      sports skills in natural settings. To find complementary procedures to enhance
      skill acquisition, a coaching method involving several behavioral techniques was 
      developed that focused on remediation of errors. This coaching method combined
      the following components: (1) systematic use of verbal instructions and feedback,
      (2) positive and negative reinforcement, (3) positive practice, and (4) time out.
      Three sports, football, gymnastics, and tennis, were selected to determine the
      effectiveness and generality of this behavioral coaching method. A total of 23
      male and female subjects, ranging in age from 11 to 35, was included in this
      study. Baseline data were first collected for each sport under standard coaching 
      conditions. Next, the behavioral coaching method was evaluated depending on the
      sport in either a multiple baseline or a reversal design. The behavioral
      dimensions selected were blocking in football; backward walkovers, front hand
      springs, and reverse kips in gymnastics; and the forehand, backhand, and serve in
      tennis. Behavioral coaching was immediately effective in increasing the correct
      execution of complex skills in all three sports. Gains of up to 10 times the
      baseline performance were achieved in each sport. In football, behavioral
      coaching resulted in an increase in correct blocking performance from a baseline 
      average of 5% to 51.3%. Gymnasts' performances increased from baseline averages
      of 2.7% to 52.6% across the three skills. In tennis, standard coaching produced
      an average of 6% correct performance which increased dramatically under
      behavioral coaching to 57% across the three strokes. The success of the
      behavioral coaching package used here suggests that a technology of behavior may 
      offer additional and complementary strategies to the acquisition of motor skills 
      in the natural environment.

TI  - Administrative issues in the management of a sports medicine program.
PG  - 289-94
AB  - Sports medicine is a subspecialty of medicine which has recently gained
      prominence in this country. It is usually practiced in conjunction with a
      specific program of sports medicine in an institutional setting, such as a
      university. This article describes the integration of sports medicine and the
      department of athletics at Yale University. The athletic medicine department, as 
      it is called, treats both the injuries and other medical problems of students
      participating in the organized athletic programs, be they intercollegiate or
      intramural, which are organized by the University. Problems that arise both
      medically, such as when to play an injured player, and administratively, such as 
      who should supervise trainers, are discussed. Guidelines are given for choosing
      the director of this program, as are examples of how to deal with problems
      between the physicians and the coaches.

TI  - Sports medicine centers in the United States: the personnel, patients, and
      services.
PG  - 222-5
AB  - Sports medicine in the United States is a rapidly expanding field. The movement
      of the public into organized and informal recreation and sports has stimulated
      the growth and sophistication of sports medicine. In the last 35 years,
      sports-related injuries have received unprecedented interest. Numerous sports
      medicine centers (SMC) have been established to meet the increased demand for a
      specialized approach to the treatment of sports injuries. Three main functions of
      SMC's have been reported: 1) research into the causes of and possible prevention 
      of sports injuries; 2) sports medicine education for physicians, medical
      students, allied medical professionals, coaches, and the public; and 3) care of
      the injured athlete including the areas of prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and 
      rehabilitate.In the latter half of 1978, this investigator surveyed SMC's in the 
      United States to identify the status of selected aspects of the operations and
      approaches to sports medical treatment at these centers and also to provide a
      profile of sports medicine centers. A listing of SMC's was generated and a
      specially constructed survey instrument was mailed to 85 centers. Of the centers 
      identified for this study, 71 (83.5%) responded with either a completed survey or
      a letter of explanation. Of those 71 responding, 56 (79%) met criteria
      established for inclusion in the study. These criteria were that the SMC: 1)
      specialized in the care of athletic injuries, and 2) had a patient population
      presenting primarily participant sports-related injuries.J Orthop Sports Phys

PG  - 50-2
AB  - There are only a few qualified supervisors for sports for the mentally
      handicapped although they are greatly needed. The Deutsche Caritasverband
      (association of German catholic welfare organisations) has now developed a
      training programme for sports supervisors which follows the training regulations 
      of the Deutsche Sportbund (a German sports association). It is intended for all
      interested in working with the disabled. The whole training course consists of
      180 hours. It is devided into a basic and an advanced course, each lasting one
      week of 75 study hours. Between these two courses the attendants are obliged to
      study at home and to observe and work with groups of disabled for at least 30
      hours. The studies mainly focus on the two subjects "sports for the physically
      handicapped" and "sports for the mentally handicapped" and lead to the sports
      supervisors certificates A or F of the Deutsche Behindertensportverband (a German
      association for sports for the disabled).

TI  - Factors related to competitive stress among male youth sport participants.
PG  - 103-8
AB  - A study was conducted to determine intrapersonal and situational factors related 
      to the stress experienced by 11 and 12 year old boys participating in competitive
      youth sports. Potential stress related factors were assessed at preseason,
      pregame, and postgame periods. The indicant of stress was state anxiety measured 
      by the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory for Children administered 30 minutes
      prior to and immediately following a competitive soccer game. Findings indicated 
      that competitive trait anxiety, self esteem, basal state anxiety, and
      expectancies of self and team performance outcomes were significantly related to 
      stress experienced when anticipating competition. As hypothesized, game win-loss 
      was a highly significant predictor of post-game stress. Other predictors of
      postgame stress were the game win-loss x game closeness interaction, the amount
      of fun experienced during the game, basal state anxiety, and the perceived
      importance of a game win to the coach. The findings are discussed in terms of the
      child's actual and perceived response capabilities in meeting the performance
      demands of the highly evaluative sport competition process.

TI  - Adrenaline, arousal and sport.
PG  - 117-21
AB  - In general, the literautre review provides theoretical explanations for the
      popular, common-sense belief that a little stress improves performance, whereas
      when stress becomes severe, performance declines and ultimately breaks down. In
      terms of psychological stress (as opposed to physiological) the single most
      important variable appears to be the subject's interpretation of the
      stress-producing stimuli. Increases in adrenaline and noradrenaline accompany a
      variety of emotional responses, but differential proportions are not seen as
      characterizing the various emotions. Noradrenaline secretion appears to be
      related to physiological stress, or the amount of work attempted by the organism.
      Adrenaline secretion seems to be more-directly related to mental stress and
      emotional response. As emotional involvement increases, adrenal medullary
      secretion of adrenaline increases. The accompanying physiological and metabolic
      responses faciltate performance to a point; however, extremely high levels of
      arousal may adversely affect the athlete's proficiency. This is expecially true
      of sport skills requiring steadiness, precision, and concentration. Finally, for 
      the sake of perspective, it should be stated that any contribution or
      complication created by the catecholamines is minimal when the entire ability
      range of competitors is considered. Whereas near superhuman feats by ordinary
      individuals caught in life-threatening situations have been reported, variations 
      of great magnitude are unlikely in sport. The average individual is not
      transformed into a world class athlete merely by "getting the adrenaline
      flowing." Among athletes of similar physical stature and physiological function, 
      however, adrenaline and arousal may certainly tip the scale of performance in
      sport.
